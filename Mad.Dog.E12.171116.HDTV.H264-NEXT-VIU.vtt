(All characters, organizations, locations,)

2
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.595
(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:11.638
No, thanks.

4
00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:14.248
I heard you only speak casually with friends.

5
00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.478
That's why I'm asking you to speak casually.

6
00:00:16.478 --> 00:00:18.018
You never know.

7
00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.489
I might end up calling you Min Joon.

8
00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:24.588
I'll think about it.

9
00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.619
The meat might get burnt. Come along.

10
00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.329
Gosh, why is he playing hard to get?

11
00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.618
Mr. Kim.

12
00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:00.218
Min Joon!

13
00:01:10.198 --> 00:01:11.398
What's with him?

14
00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:13.739
Do you know him?

15
00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:20.909
Pen...

16
00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:22.249
Pentium.

17
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:25.978
Pentium, Pentium.

18
00:01:27.648 --> 00:01:28.749
Pentium.

19
00:01:31.588 --> 00:01:35.859
No. Help us. Help!

20
00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:38.058
Pentium.

21
00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.799
No.

22
00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.519
Ms. Jang.

23
00:01:58.678 --> 00:01:59.778
Help us.

24
00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:02.318
Help us.

25
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:44.998
(Operating room)

26
00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.329
Mr. Choi.

27
00:02:50.098 --> 00:02:51.098
Mr. Choi.

28
00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.338
What happened?

29
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.739
He was stabbed and he...

30
00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.109
He's bleeding too much.

31
00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.348
He'll be fine.

32
00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.519
He wouldn't die from a stab.

33
00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.789
Where is Kim Min Joon?

34
00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.829
Where is he?

35
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.248
Kim Min Joon.

36
00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:45.319
Kim Min Joon.

37
00:03:47.428 --> 00:03:48.528
Don't.

38
00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:51.998
Don't touch me.

39
00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.558
Wash the blood off, and come out.

40
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:08.609
Did you see his face?

41
00:04:09.678 --> 00:04:10.748
No, I didn't.

42
00:04:13.148 --> 00:04:14.819
No, I don't know.

43
00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.619
I don't remember.

44
00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.559
I don't remember anything.

45
00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.098
Remember something.

46
00:04:29.228 --> 00:04:31.499
We have to find the one who stabbed Noo Ri.

47
00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.168
You don't need to look far.

48
00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.038
I'm right in front of you.

49
00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:41.809
I...

50
00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:45.379
dragged you into all this...

51
00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.148
to uncover the truth...

52
00:04:51.788 --> 00:04:53.288
about my brother's death.

53
00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.259
I'm no different from them.

54
00:05:00.598 --> 00:05:02.598
I dragged people in,

55
00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:04.798
put them in danger,

56
00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:08.309
and got them killed.

57
00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:09.709
Nobody got killed.

58
00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.519
That's right. It's your fault.

59
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:22.048
If it wasn't for you,

60
00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:25.019
Noo Ri wouldn't be in there.

61
00:05:27.658 --> 00:05:28.759
Kim Min Joon.

62
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:30.999
Life your head, and look at me.

63
00:05:32.658 --> 00:05:34.269
There is one in front of you too.

64
00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:37.769
Someone who put innocent people...

65
00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:40.509
in danger.

66
00:05:45.338 --> 00:05:46.408
You're scared, aren't you?

67
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:49.278
You're scared to death, aren't you?

68
00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.348
Of course.

69
00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.019
You should be.

70
00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:54.918
But...

71
00:05:56.988 --> 00:05:58.288
you have to hold it.

72
00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:03.488
Be scared only on the inside.

73
00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:05.629
Don't curl up and tremble...

74
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.398
with fear like a fool.

75
00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.038
That's what the people...

76
00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.168
who came after you and hurt us...

77
00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:16.168
want.

78
00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:21.348
Mr. Choi.

79
00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:33.389
His liver was damaged...

80
00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.358
due to an abdominal contusion.

81
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.598
The knife didn't cut through an aorta,

82
00:06:38.028 --> 00:06:39.798
but we had to remove some of his liver.

83
00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:42.528
He bled too much,

84
00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:44.238
so he's unconscious...

85
00:06:44.238 --> 00:06:45.538
from an ischemic stroke.

86
00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:46.838
Then...

87
00:06:48.038 --> 00:06:49.209
you don't know...

88
00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:51.309
when he'll wake up, right?

89
00:07:18.168 --> 00:07:19.798
Doctor, what is it?

90
00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:22.439
His family requested him to be moved to a VIP room.

91
00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:24.278
Check his vitals, and get him ready to move.

92
00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:25.338
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

93
00:07:26.338 --> 00:07:28.679
By the way, who are these people?

94
00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.179
- You aren't his guardian. - I am.

95
00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:32.619
You aren't his family.

96
00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.619
Nurse Oh, what are you doing?

97
00:07:35.848 --> 00:07:37.119
Make them leave.

98
00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:38.418
Doctor.

99
00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:40.788
They're like his family.

100
00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:42.728
Please let us stay a little longer.

101
00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:43.929
Please, sir.

102
00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:45.429
Mr. Choi.

103
00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:51.338
Please come with us, sir.

104
00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:53.769
Is Chief On...

105
00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:55.108
here?

106
00:07:55.538 --> 00:07:56.538
Where is he?

107
00:07:56.538 --> 00:07:58.608
Chief On is a busy man.

108
00:07:59.108 --> 00:08:02.408
His son is in a coma and unconscious.

109
00:08:02.408 --> 00:08:04.679
That's none of your business.

110
00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:06.148
Leave, now.

111
00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:07.548
We won't.

112
00:08:09.548 --> 00:08:10.718
Ha Ri.

113
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:12.288
Guys.

114
00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:14.129
Let's leave.

115
00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:15.129
Mr. Choi.

116
00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:16.158
Let's go.

117
00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:38.348
(Mad Dog: Poison)

118
00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:42.419
Lee Young Ho. 40 years old.

119
00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:44.258
He was born in Hyunrim-dong, Busan.

120
00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:45.358
He's single.

121
00:08:45.588 --> 00:08:46.659
Wait.

122
00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.358
Hyunrim-dong, Busan?

123
00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.699
That's Chairman Cha's hometown.

124
00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:53.429
Lee Young Ho...

125
00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:55.399
and Taeyang Insurance go way back.

126
00:08:56.199 --> 00:08:57.199
Look at this.

127
00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.939
It's an article from 2001.

128
00:08:59.069 --> 00:09:01.108
Chosen as a Taeyang Insurance Scholar...

129
00:09:01.108 --> 00:09:02.439
in 1996,

130
00:09:02.439 --> 00:09:04.439
he received scholarship...

131
00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:05.838
for five years.

132
00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:08.378
He was 1 of 991 who passed...

133
00:09:08.378 --> 00:09:11.319
the 43rd bar exam.

134
00:09:11.378 --> 00:09:12.618
He's from the same hometown as Chairman Cha,

135
00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:14.789
and he's a Taeyang scholar.

136
00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:16.518
What's at the bottom is more interesting.

137
00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:19.059
"I'm grateful to Taeyang Scholarship Committee..."

138
00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:21.588
"and Chairman Cha who believed in me..."

139
00:09:21.588 --> 00:09:24.429
"when I wasn't even a law school student."

140
00:09:24.429 --> 00:09:26.728
So Lee Young Ho is indebted to...

141
00:09:26.728 --> 00:09:28.429
Chairman Cha.

142
00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:30.069
He was a UDT.

143
00:09:30.468 --> 00:09:31.838
UDT stands for...

144
00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:34.108
Underwater Demolition Team, isn't it?

145
00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:36.268
Gosh, he was a SEAL?

146
00:09:38.008 --> 00:09:40.079
That jerk stabbed Pentium.

147
00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:42.579
What are his hobbies and specialties?

148
00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:46.679
Nothing much.

149
00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:48.789
Maybe your research skill isn't good.

150
00:09:49.018 --> 00:09:50.488
Do you think I'm Cheetah?

151
00:09:50.488 --> 00:09:52.018
"Do you think I'm Cheetah?"

152
00:09:52.189 --> 00:09:53.829
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

153
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:54.929
Cheetah.

154
00:09:55.988 --> 00:09:57.128
You really didn't find anything?

155
00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:58.628
Yes, I did.

156
00:09:58.858 --> 00:10:01.169
He has a new hobby.

157
00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:02.199
What is it?

158
00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:03.228
Me.

159
00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:05.238
Killing Jan Gebauer.

160
00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:06.468
Hey, Mr. Kim.

161
00:10:06.468 --> 00:10:08.138
Whatever you're thinking,

162
00:10:08.138 --> 00:10:09.909
don't do it.

163
00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:12.579
I wasn't thinking anything.

164
00:10:13.638 --> 00:10:14.909
I better go wash up...

165
00:10:14.909 --> 00:10:16.209
and get changed.

166
00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:17.649
I'm going upstairs.

167
00:10:18.848 --> 00:10:19.978
Hey, Kim Min Joon.

168
00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:21.388
Mr. Choi.

169
00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:23.618
Are you going to nag at me again?

170
00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:26.919
Don't worry.

171
00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.959
I won't do anything on my own.

172
00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.488
You never know.

173
00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:56.848
I might end up calling you Min Joon.

174
00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.258
Min Joon!

175
00:11:05.628 --> 00:11:07.569
Pentium.

176
00:11:08.728 --> 00:11:09.768
No...

177
00:11:11.498 --> 00:11:13.468
No. Help us. Help!

178
00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:36.029
Goodness.

179
00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:40.529
I'm sure I reset the password.

180
00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:41.728
How did you come in?

181
00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:44.569
Noo Ri hacked the passcode again yesterday.

182
00:11:45.199 --> 00:11:46.569
Goodness, Pentium.

183
00:11:47.738 --> 00:11:50.309
I'll teach him a lesson when he wakes up.

184
00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:51.638
You should do that.

185
00:11:52.108 --> 00:11:55.008
I guess you're my bodyguard today.

186
00:11:55.549 --> 00:11:57.679
Sleep on the sofa. Don't think about coming in.

187
00:11:57.848 --> 00:12:00.049
I slept on the sofa when I stayed in your house.

188
00:12:00.518 --> 00:12:01.518
Kim Min Joon.

189
00:12:01.518 --> 00:12:03.888
Why do you sound so serious again?

190
00:12:05.888 --> 00:12:07.118
You need to listen to this.

191
00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:15.968
Mayday, mayday.

192
00:12:16.098 --> 00:12:18.799
Jeju Tower, respond.

193
00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:21.338
Mayday, mayday.

194
00:12:21.338 --> 00:12:22.569
What's wrong with this?

195
00:12:22.569 --> 00:12:25.238
Jeju Tower, respond.

196
00:12:25.909 --> 00:12:31.319
No!

197
00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:35.649
Bum Joon.

198
00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:04.518
I...

199
00:13:08.118 --> 00:13:09.218
never had a drink...

200
00:13:11.118 --> 00:13:13.518
with my brother before.

201
00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:17.628
He asked me to drink with him so many times,

202
00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:21.128
but I never said yes.

203
00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:24.699
There are so many things like that.

204
00:13:25.699 --> 00:13:26.868
That's how it is.

205
00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:28.508
It's the same for everyone.

206
00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:32.338
But I had a drink several times...

207
00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:34.909
with you already.

208
00:13:37.008 --> 00:13:38.279
Don't drink if you don't want to.

209
00:13:38.579 --> 00:13:39.819
It's not like I don't want to.

210
00:13:41.348 --> 00:13:42.419
I'm scared...

211
00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:46.559
that I might cry,

212
00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.258
remembering today later.

213
00:13:51.258 --> 00:13:52.358
That's what I'm scared of.

214
00:14:06.138 --> 00:14:07.179
Kim Min Joon.

215
00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.649
Shall we do it just the two of us from now on?

216
00:14:12.179 --> 00:14:13.848
And not drag in...

217
00:14:14.988 --> 00:14:16.248
other people?

218
00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:23.358
Shall we?

219
00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:25.758
Shall we, my foot.

220
00:14:29.598 --> 00:14:30.638
Cheetah.

221
00:14:31.098 --> 00:14:33.968
What do you think these two are doing?

222
00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:36.939
They're saying they'll go catch...

223
00:14:36.939 --> 00:14:40.608
the punk who stabbed Noo Ri without us.

224
00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:43.679
You disappoint me, Kang Woo.

225
00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:47.488
I'm worried you might get hurt too.

226
00:14:47.488 --> 00:14:48.649
Then you'll be in pain.

227
00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:50.888
You better be.

228
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:52.358
Do suffer.

229
00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.888
Do you realize that you're so cowardly now?

230
00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:59.628
You'll feel at ease if we just leave.

231
00:14:59.628 --> 00:15:00.968
But what about us?

232
00:15:01.598 --> 00:15:03.169
What if you two get hurt?

233
00:15:03.368 --> 00:15:04.768
You think we'll be fine?

234
00:15:05.498 --> 00:15:08.039
Why would you unload your sense of guilt onto us?

235
00:15:08.039 --> 00:15:09.709
That's so cowardly.

236
00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:13.279
I'll go until the end.

237
00:15:14.108 --> 00:15:15.449
If something happens to me,

238
00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:19.118
please do suffer, Mr. Kim.

239
00:15:22.819 --> 00:15:25.758
I don't think I'll suffer.

240
00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:28.258
Then it's another reason I shouldn't be out.

241
00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:30.029
What do you think, Cheetah?

242
00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:32.998
Have you seen a cheetah backing away?

243
00:15:33.228 --> 00:15:34.468
It goes forward no matter what.

244
00:15:37.368 --> 00:15:39.098
Goodness.

245
00:15:39.598 --> 00:15:41.508
You really didn't have to come...

246
00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:43.539
visit me in this shabby office.

247
00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:45.039
Please enjoy.

248
00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:47.008
It's oolong tea.

249
00:15:47.008 --> 00:15:48.579
They grow worms on tea leaves...

250
00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:51.118
and make this tea with those nibbled leaves.

251
00:15:51.419 --> 00:15:53.718
It's sweet like honey,

252
00:15:54.248 --> 00:15:56.789
and it smells strong.

253
00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:59.559
It's good for mental health too.

254
00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:00.728
You look like you're enjoying yourself.

255
00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:03.029
You must be feeling so refreshing.

256
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:04.799
Not much.

257
00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:05.899
I feel suffocated like I ate...

258
00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:07.228
about a million sweet potatoes.

259
00:16:09.598 --> 00:16:11.299
You couldn't take care of the worm...

260
00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:13.368
and annoyed the sleeping tiger.

261
00:16:13.768 --> 00:16:15.409
Meet with Chief On.

262
00:16:16.039 --> 00:16:17.069
Me?

263
00:16:17.608 --> 00:16:18.608
Why?

264
00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:22.248
You have nothing in your hands, Chairman Cha.

265
00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:24.748
Your precious daughter gave my stuff...

266
00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:26.378
to the dog.

267
00:16:26.378 --> 00:16:28.919
We can simply find it back.

268
00:16:29.118 --> 00:16:30.118
How?

269
00:16:30.118 --> 00:16:31.559
Meet with Chief On.

270
00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:34.388
Confess it's your doing.

271
00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:39.098
What did I do?

272
00:16:39.258 --> 00:16:41.799
Young Ho, who stabbed Chief On's eldest son,

273
00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:43.429
works at JH Group.

274
00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:45.699
What are you talking about?

275
00:16:46.368 --> 00:16:48.108
He works here,

276
00:16:48.108 --> 00:16:49.738
but he belongs to you.

277
00:16:49.738 --> 00:16:50.738
Is that so?

278
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.608
But I didn't know about this.

279
00:16:53.338 --> 00:16:55.348
How amazing.

280
00:16:56.008 --> 00:16:58.319
You'll dump this on Mr. Lee Young Ho?

281
00:17:00.588 --> 00:17:02.549
You trust him more than your daughter,

282
00:17:02.549 --> 00:17:04.788
but you can throw him out if he goes useless.

283
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:07.828
Does he know about this?

284
00:17:09.159 --> 00:17:10.459
It's not my idea.

285
00:17:10.828 --> 00:17:12.199
It's his idea.

286
00:17:13.228 --> 00:17:15.369
Well, well.

287
00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:17.939
How impressive.

288
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:20.099
Did you put him in my company...

289
00:17:20.399 --> 00:17:23.468
until now just for this purpose?

290
00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:38.419
You wanted to see me in your son's ward,

291
00:17:38.988 --> 00:17:40.528
and I'm not sure what I should do.

292
00:17:43.389 --> 00:17:45.629
I'm truly sorry, sir.

293
00:17:45.629 --> 00:17:47.998
Why would you apologize?

294
00:17:49.028 --> 00:17:51.599
I know someone else was behind this.

295
00:17:51.798 --> 00:17:53.768
Chairman Cha of Taeyang.

296
00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:58.738
Our company's legal affairs manager,

297
00:17:58.738 --> 00:18:01.849
Mr. Lee works at JH Group only on the surface.

298
00:18:02.409 --> 00:18:03.919
He's been Chairman Cha's person...

299
00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:05.578
since he passed the bar.

300
00:18:06.548 --> 00:18:10.018
Does he think I don't know such stuff?

301
00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:12.758
You're as good...

302
00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:14.859
as expected.

303
00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:17.028
Don't try to get wise.

304
00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:21.599
Just do as I say.

305
00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:25.899
We have the common purpose now.

306
00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.738
You and I...

307
00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:33.978
have the common purpose?

308
00:18:35.849 --> 00:18:37.718
I'm not so attached to him,

309
00:18:38.018 --> 00:18:39.748
but he's my son...

310
00:18:39.949 --> 00:18:42.119
and my family.

311
00:18:42.919 --> 00:18:45.058
I can't let this slide.

312
00:18:46.389 --> 00:18:48.959
You knew this?

313
00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:54.798
Two years ago, Chairman Joo...

314
00:18:54.798 --> 00:18:57.498
collapsed in Chairman Cha's greenhouse.

315
00:18:57.968 --> 00:19:01.538
He couldn't survive from it.

316
00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:03.308
Chairman Joo actually had a chronic illness,

317
00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.978
even though everyone hushed it up.

318
00:19:07.508 --> 00:19:08.649
Asthma.

319
00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:09.808
On that particular day,

320
00:19:10.409 --> 00:19:12.978
he didn't have his inhaler.

321
00:19:14.649 --> 00:19:15.949
There's that kind of a day.

322
00:19:16.949 --> 00:19:18.518
A destined day...

323
00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:21.889
on which he forgot to bring his inhaler...

324
00:19:24.199 --> 00:19:25.728
and ended up dying.

325
00:20:03.968 --> 00:20:06.669
I'm sorry for your loss.

326
00:20:07.409 --> 00:20:08.639
Vice President Joo.

327
00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:12.939
Thank you,

328
00:20:13.639 --> 00:20:14.748
Chief On.

329
00:20:29.758 --> 00:20:31.028
You're cutting off...

330
00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:33.099
your favorite trees?

331
00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:34.399
Others touched them.

332
00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.669
They're not mine anymore.

333
00:20:37.538 --> 00:20:38.798
I'm sorry, Dad.

334
00:20:38.798 --> 00:20:41.209
Write a resignation letter and leave the company.

335
00:20:42.068 --> 00:20:44.109
On Joo Sik and Joo Hyun Ki met up.

336
00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:45.538
I put them up for it.

337
00:20:46.939 --> 00:20:48.609
I told Hyun Ki to tell him...

338
00:20:48.609 --> 00:20:50.818
that he's the one behind his son's trouble.

339
00:20:50.818 --> 00:20:53.379
It's rather weird to say he spilled the truth.

340
00:20:53.379 --> 00:20:54.949
They shook hands...

341
00:20:54.949 --> 00:20:56.788
and left each other on a good term.

342
00:20:56.988 --> 00:20:58.058
What?

343
00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.119
Joo Hyun Ki...

344
00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:03.258
isn't someone who will back down easily.

345
00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:06.998
Do you want JH?

346
00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:09.068
I will...

347
00:21:09.968 --> 00:21:11.038
give it to you.

348
00:21:11.498 --> 00:21:12.568
Hong Joo.

349
00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:17.839
What are you going to do?

350
00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:20.409
I'm going to take what Mr. Choi promised me.

351
00:21:20.748 --> 00:21:22.778
I will get Joo Hyun Ki without causing...

352
00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:25.649
any problems to Taeyang Insurance.

353
00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:28.988
Hong Joo, you are full of spite.

354
00:21:30.349 --> 00:21:31.659
What do you need?

355
00:21:32.288 --> 00:21:34.028
Legal Affairs Manager Lee Young Ho.

356
00:21:34.728 --> 00:21:35.959
I need him.

357
00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:41.728
A letter of resignation?

358
00:21:46.869 --> 00:21:48.808
This is all too sudden.

359
00:21:49.439 --> 00:21:50.709
I'm disappointed.

360
00:21:52.209 --> 00:21:53.508
I apologize, Vice President Joo.

361
00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:55.578
It'll be much better for me to leave...

362
00:21:55.748 --> 00:21:58.278
before I cause any further problems to JH.

363
00:21:59.748 --> 00:22:01.748
Are you really considering turning yourself in?

364
00:22:03.988 --> 00:22:05.318
It looks like you'll do anything...

365
00:22:05.318 --> 00:22:07.488
that Chairman Cha asks you to do.

366
00:22:08.459 --> 00:22:10.159
Thank you for everything, Vice President Joo.

367
00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:13.528
Mr. Lee.

368
00:22:15.498 --> 00:22:16.599
Don't trust...

369
00:22:17.498 --> 00:22:18.869
Chairman Cha too much.

370
00:22:21.109 --> 00:22:23.978
That old man doesn't have a heart.

371
00:22:24.778 --> 00:22:26.109
If you start doing everything for him,

372
00:22:26.109 --> 00:22:28.909
he will end up asking for your heart too.

373
00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:36.689
Thank you for your wise advice.

374
00:22:45.758 --> 00:22:47.169
Legal Affairs Manager Lee Young Ho...

375
00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:48.629
just left JH.

376
00:22:48.968 --> 00:22:51.339
Is he going to untie himself and fight us?

377
00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:54.139
Then his necktie will end up around my neck.

378
00:22:55.238 --> 00:22:56.909
That's not what I meant.

379
00:22:58.078 --> 00:22:59.308
I'm sorry.

380
00:22:59.439 --> 00:23:01.679
It's okay. It was thrilling.

381
00:23:01.679 --> 00:23:03.209
Gosh, you're pretending to be so tough.

382
00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:05.818
Hey.

383
00:23:06.248 --> 00:23:07.488
We have a guest.

384
00:23:08.218 --> 00:23:10.758
Pentium put up a security camera in the hallway.

385
00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:12.288
Noo Ri, that kid.

386
00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:17.199
What's all that?

387
00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:19.459
Why do you all keep those in the desks?

388
00:23:21.998 --> 00:23:23.498
- Gosh. - What is it?

389
00:23:23.498 --> 00:23:24.869
What? Who is it?

390
00:23:35.278 --> 00:23:37.449
Don't do this. I won't hurt you.

391
00:23:39.379 --> 00:23:41.288
Ms. Oh. What brings you here?

392
00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:42.988
Hello, Ms. Oh.

393
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:44.218
Hello.

394
00:23:44.488 --> 00:23:47.159
You're more beautiful outside of work.

395
00:23:47.328 --> 00:23:49.788
I do look rather elegant outside of my uniform.

396
00:23:58.568 --> 00:24:00.609
Pentium's father and Joo Hyun Ki...

397
00:24:00.808 --> 00:24:02.839
had a meeting in Noo Ri's hospital room?

398
00:24:02.939 --> 00:24:06.308
His father came around every day,

399
00:24:06.538 --> 00:24:08.008
but all of his visitors looked like...

400
00:24:08.409 --> 00:24:10.849
they had nothing to do with the patient...

401
00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:13.078
including that man.

402
00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:15.689
So he's holding secret meetings...

403
00:24:15.889 --> 00:24:17.859
in his unconscious son's hospital room?

404
00:24:17.859 --> 00:24:19.988
Then there must be a high chance...

405
00:24:19.988 --> 00:24:21.389
Vice President Joo might visit again.

406
00:24:22.129 --> 00:24:23.859
We should do something.

407
00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:26.199
Right, Ms. Oh.

408
00:24:29.028 --> 00:24:30.028
Darn you.

409
00:24:31.968 --> 00:24:33.498
What do you want to do?

410
00:24:33.498 --> 00:24:35.839
What should we do, Mr. Choi?

411
00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:37.008
What we always do.

412
00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:38.139
What we always do?

413
00:24:39.209 --> 00:24:41.008
- Bugging? - Bugging?

414
00:24:42.078 --> 00:24:44.879
Mr. Choi, even nurses need to be cleared...

415
00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:46.578
before they enter a VIP's hospital room.

416
00:24:52.459 --> 00:24:53.659
Ms. Oh.

417
00:24:54.589 --> 00:24:55.859
Yes, Mr. Choi.

418
00:24:55.859 --> 00:24:58.528
You know, don't you? I know that...

419
00:24:58.728 --> 00:25:00.228
Chief On is Noo Ri's family,

420
00:25:00.828 --> 00:25:02.429
but I can't let this go on.

421
00:25:02.828 --> 00:25:04.599
Please, I ask of you.

422
00:25:05.038 --> 00:25:06.298
Mr. Choi.

423
00:25:06.699 --> 00:25:08.209
I'm afraid we have different thoughts.

424
00:25:09.369 --> 00:25:12.139
You can't call him the patient's family.

425
00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:16.248
A real family wouldn't do anything like that...

426
00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:17.818
next to his unconscious son.

427
00:25:22.949 --> 00:25:24.359
Give me the bugging device.

428
00:25:24.889 --> 00:25:25.889
Ms. Oh.

429
00:25:28.328 --> 00:25:30.058
Please promise me one thing.

430
00:25:30.828 --> 00:25:32.459
You will erase...

431
00:25:32.459 --> 00:25:34.468
any personal medical information...

432
00:25:34.468 --> 00:25:35.869
of the patient from the recording.

433
00:25:36.929 --> 00:25:39.899
I must keep my work ethics as a nurse...

434
00:25:39.899 --> 00:25:41.468
to protect the patient's rights.

435
00:25:42.068 --> 00:25:43.308
I will do that.

436
00:25:45.839 --> 00:25:47.978
You're so cool, Ms. Oh.

437
00:25:47.978 --> 00:25:49.048
I know.

438
00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:56.889
(Marinated crab triangular gimbap)

439
00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:59.558
Do I leave this on the patient's bed?

440
00:26:01.758 --> 00:26:03.389
Pentium may...

441
00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:05.998
want to reach me when he wakes up.

442
00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:08.869
What's this?

443
00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:11.199
Oh, that?

444
00:26:11.568 --> 00:26:14.369
I always stole his triangular gimbap...

445
00:26:14.468 --> 00:26:15.839
and left the wrapping...

446
00:26:16.068 --> 00:26:18.008
under my mattress.

447
00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:22.349
Look, like this.

448
00:26:23.209 --> 00:26:25.119
Why would you do that?

449
00:26:25.379 --> 00:26:26.518
Right.

450
00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:29.649
Pentium looked too adorable...

451
00:26:29.718 --> 00:26:31.419
when he got angry.

452
00:26:33.189 --> 00:26:34.488
When he sees this,

453
00:26:34.889 --> 00:26:36.389
he'll know what it means.

454
00:26:38.228 --> 00:26:41.728
Make sure that only the tip shows.

455
00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:43.798
Okay.

456
00:26:44.498 --> 00:26:46.369
(Nurse Oh Seo Ra)

457
00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:51.238
- Hello. - Hello.

458
00:26:52.008 --> 00:26:53.209
Hello.

459
00:27:35.748 --> 00:27:38.459
(Marinated crab triangular gimbap)

460
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:40.689
Patient On Noo Ri.

461
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:42.758
You have to get up soon.

462
00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:46.129
They're all waiting for you.

463
00:28:01.478 --> 00:28:03.478
On Joo Sik, 54 years old.

464
00:28:03.478 --> 00:28:05.318
He's the chief of Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

465
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:08.189
He was the youngest person...

466
00:28:08.189 --> 00:28:09.849
to pass the bar exam when he was 20.

467
00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:11.318
When he became a prosecutor,

468
00:28:11.318 --> 00:28:14.359
he rose to fame when he caught...

469
00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.828
Dongbang Gang's chief commander.

470
00:28:16.228 --> 00:28:19.199
That chief commander of Dongbang Gang was...

471
00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:20.929
apparently a very scary man,

472
00:28:20.929 --> 00:28:23.429
but a young prosecutor came in and took him out.

473
00:28:23.429 --> 00:28:25.268
Then he married the third daughter...

474
00:28:25.268 --> 00:28:27.068
of KP Corporation when he turned 26.

475
00:28:27.068 --> 00:28:29.068
Come to think about it,

476
00:28:29.068 --> 00:28:30.538
Pentium's mother's side is KP Corporation.

477
00:28:30.538 --> 00:28:32.609
Is that a big company?

478
00:28:32.609 --> 00:28:34.478
Oh, boy. They have so much cash.

479
00:28:34.808 --> 00:28:37.248
They can probably get over 100 of this building.

480
00:28:37.978 --> 00:28:40.919
The great landlord was someone else after all.

481
00:28:41.189 --> 00:28:42.248
Good for him.

482
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:44.718
He was the head of special investigation,

483
00:28:44.718 --> 00:28:46.718
then he was the head of central investigation,

484
00:28:46.718 --> 00:28:48.389
walking down the road of success.

485
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:49.929
Then he failed to become the superintendent,

486
00:28:49.929 --> 00:28:51.498
and moved down to Busan.

487
00:28:51.498 --> 00:28:52.498
Early this year, right after the election.

488
00:28:52.498 --> 00:28:54.228
This means he wasn't favored...

489
00:28:54.228 --> 00:28:55.699
by the new government.

490
00:28:55.699 --> 00:28:57.468
Then he made a glamorous return...

491
00:28:57.468 --> 00:28:58.899
as the Chief...

492
00:28:58.899 --> 00:29:00.468
of Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

493
00:29:00.968 --> 00:29:03.768
That means someone gave him the position.

494
00:29:03.768 --> 00:29:04.909
Is it Joo Hyun Ki?

495
00:29:05.778 --> 00:29:09.078
No, it has to be at least Cha Joon Kyu.

496
00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:12.179
It looks like...

497
00:29:12.478 --> 00:29:15.018
Pentium's father wants more power.

498
00:29:15.018 --> 00:29:16.048
What?

499
00:29:17.619 --> 00:29:20.788
He had another meeting yesterday.

500
00:29:20.788 --> 00:29:22.589
Run for the next presidential election?

501
00:29:22.589 --> 00:29:24.058
It's too early to discuss that.

502
00:29:29.699 --> 00:29:31.639
It will be a while...

503
00:29:31.639 --> 00:29:32.768
until this government is over.

504
00:29:32.768 --> 00:29:34.709
Four years will pass by in a flash.

505
00:29:34.709 --> 00:29:35.968
It's about time you made...

506
00:29:35.968 --> 00:29:37.778
a strong impression on the people.

507
00:29:38.978 --> 00:29:41.149
Don't you think you need to resolve...

508
00:29:41.449 --> 00:29:42.649
a huge incident...

509
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:44.478
that will put your name down in history?

510
00:29:44.478 --> 00:29:46.149
Do you want me to resolve a case...

511
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:47.548
to become a star?

512
00:29:48.048 --> 00:29:49.988
People of this nation are uncivilized,

513
00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:52.389
so they tend to vote for someone they know.

514
00:29:52.718 --> 00:29:53.859
A righteous prosecutor.

515
00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:55.129
A symbol of justice.

516
00:29:55.228 --> 00:29:56.889
It doesn't sound so bad.

517
00:29:57.929 --> 00:29:59.659
So Mr. On wants to...

518
00:30:00.028 --> 00:30:02.629
become a righteous star prosecutor?

519
00:30:03.998 --> 00:30:07.369
A case that can leave a strong impression.

520
00:30:08.068 --> 00:30:09.238
Flight 801.

521
00:30:11.808 --> 00:30:13.478
Do you remember that he said he will...

522
00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:15.248
reinvestigate the case if we bring the black box?

523
00:30:15.248 --> 00:30:17.518
So many people died and got hurt,

524
00:30:17.518 --> 00:30:19.818
and he'll use that case to become a president?

525
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.048
Pentium's father will do that?

526
00:30:23.518 --> 00:30:26.988
It looks like Mr. On will need the black box.

527
00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:31.228
(Chief On Joo Sik)

528
00:30:33.058 --> 00:30:34.068
(Chief On Joo Sik)

529
00:30:41.738 --> 00:30:43.238
This place looks shabby,

530
00:30:43.238 --> 00:30:44.508
but they serve good food.

531
00:30:45.179 --> 00:30:47.379
It's Prosecutors' Office's favorite.

532
00:30:47.508 --> 00:30:50.718
Thank you for inviting me to somewhere special.

533
00:30:50.778 --> 00:30:52.949
This place has just one flaw.

534
00:30:52.949 --> 00:30:55.389
The food is quite expensive.

535
00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:56.919
Here.

536
00:30:57.859 --> 00:30:59.558
I'm not sure if this will cover it.

537
00:31:11.139 --> 00:31:12.238
Will you...

538
00:31:12.738 --> 00:31:13.869
re-investigate?

539
00:31:14.209 --> 00:31:15.869
As a representative of the public,

540
00:31:16.038 --> 00:31:18.179
it's my sworn duty to uphold the principle...

541
00:31:18.308 --> 00:31:21.649
of justice and human rights, and to protect...

542
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:24.149
my neighbors and community from crime.

543
00:31:24.978 --> 00:31:28.048
That's from the oath of prosecutors.

544
00:31:28.619 --> 00:31:30.189
I will re-investigate...

545
00:31:30.189 --> 00:31:31.488
without a doubt.

546
00:31:32.058 --> 00:31:33.089
That's for sure.

547
00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:36.058
Thank you,

548
00:31:36.788 --> 00:31:37.859
Chief On.

549
00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:55.578
Please enjoy your meal.

550
00:32:02.602 --> 00:32:05.834

<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

551
00:32:13.129 --> 00:32:14.629
He's on his way.

552
00:32:20.139 --> 00:32:21.139
Thank you.

553
00:32:21.468 --> 00:32:23.308
It wasn't for you.

554
00:32:23.468 --> 00:32:24.508
I know.

555
00:32:24.738 --> 00:32:26.909
Cheetah, where is he headed to?

556
00:32:29.409 --> 00:32:31.649
I think he's headed to Hanju Hospital.

557
00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:41.988
(My dear Ms. Oh)

558
00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:44.159
I'm getting a call from Nurse Oh.

559
00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:45.459
Yes, ma'am.

560
00:32:45.459 --> 00:32:46.998
The man from the last time,

561
00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:49.068
he is in the VIP room.

562
00:32:49.068 --> 00:32:50.399
The man from the last time?

563
00:32:50.498 --> 00:32:52.968
The man who wears his tie European style.

564
00:32:53.169 --> 00:32:54.538
On Joo Sik is...

565
00:32:55.409 --> 00:32:58.538
meeting Joo Hyun Ki with the original black box.

566
00:32:59.008 --> 00:33:02.278
Is he trying to give the black box to Joo Hyun Ki?

567
00:33:02.278 --> 00:33:03.649
Wasn't he planning on...

568
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:05.778
releasing a big case and hiring star prosecutors?

569
00:33:16.558 --> 00:33:17.558
Are you...

570
00:33:18.659 --> 00:33:20.429
giving this back to me?

571
00:33:20.429 --> 00:33:21.968
No, I'm not.

572
00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:24.169
I'm just showing you...

573
00:33:24.498 --> 00:33:27.468
that I have a sword to cut your throat.

574
00:33:33.308 --> 00:33:34.478
Chief On.

575
00:33:41.048 --> 00:33:42.748
Take it and re-investigate.

576
00:33:43.349 --> 00:33:45.818
Go ahead, and cut my throat.

577
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:50.389
You...

578
00:33:51.558 --> 00:33:52.929
brought me here...

579
00:33:52.929 --> 00:33:55.028
because you can't.

580
00:33:55.298 --> 00:33:57.068
If you reveal the case,

581
00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:58.899
it'll harm you more than it'll benefit you.

582
00:34:06.538 --> 00:34:08.779
190 people were injured and dead.

583
00:34:10.819 --> 00:34:11.919
It was tragic.

584
00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.948
But so what?

585
00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:18.058
Death means something...

586
00:34:18.058 --> 00:34:19.459
only when it's relevant to you.

587
00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:21.129
Most people aren't...

588
00:34:21.129 --> 00:34:24.259
related to those 190 victims.

589
00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:27.998
To them, it's just an incident...

590
00:34:27.998 --> 00:34:30.169
worth a line on SNS.

591
00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.498
So even if you re-investigate...

592
00:34:33.498 --> 00:34:35.209
and solve this case,

593
00:34:35.638 --> 00:34:37.279
the public won't remember you in four years,

594
00:34:37.538 --> 00:34:41.109
in the next presidential election.

595
00:34:42.948 --> 00:34:44.178
Well, well.

596
00:34:45.779 --> 00:34:47.219
Chairman Joo...

597
00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:50.348
had a great son.

598
00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:55.388
My father...

599
00:34:59.328 --> 00:35:01.399
passed away without realizing that.

600
00:35:05.268 --> 00:35:06.268
Chief On.

601
00:35:06.739 --> 00:35:08.739
I found something interesting...

602
00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:10.509
as I was going through my father's belongings...

603
00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:12.408
during his funeral.

604
00:35:13.739 --> 00:35:15.948
December 13, 2014.

605
00:35:15.948 --> 00:35:19.448
You sent a text message to my father.

606
00:35:23.518 --> 00:35:26.259
Ministry of Land and Transport will pass it.

607
00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:28.859
Don't worry, Chairman Joo.

608
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:38.469
I was really busy then.

609
00:35:38.868 --> 00:35:41.538
The ministry was against it for months,

610
00:35:41.808 --> 00:35:44.638
but it suddenly passed a new route.

611
00:35:45.038 --> 00:35:47.078
So they needed a plane urgently.

612
00:35:47.248 --> 00:35:49.009
A cheap aircraft that can be discarded...

613
00:35:49.009 --> 00:35:51.219
after flying a short route for a short time.

614
00:35:53.779 --> 00:35:55.549
If only the ministry...

615
00:35:55.549 --> 00:35:57.558
didn't forcibly authorize the new route,

616
00:35:57.919 --> 00:35:58.959
the plane...

617
00:36:00.888 --> 00:36:02.388
wouldn't have crashed.

618
00:36:02.388 --> 00:36:03.728
You sound like...

619
00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:06.558
I have something to do with the accident.

620
00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:08.728
Don't you?

621
00:36:09.598 --> 00:36:11.268
Then you should re-investigate.

622
00:36:11.538 --> 00:36:13.538
I'm starting to wonder...

623
00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:15.638
who else is involved.

624
00:36:15.638 --> 00:36:17.178
You're suggesting...

625
00:36:17.638 --> 00:36:19.808
we all jump in the fire with an oil drum.

626
00:36:19.808 --> 00:36:21.578
So...

627
00:36:23.178 --> 00:36:25.748
don't put a knife to my throat.

628
00:36:25.748 --> 00:36:28.049
If you tell me to "just do as I say",

629
00:36:28.049 --> 00:36:30.558
I want to jump the rails.

630
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:36.959
Will you re-investigate?

631
00:36:41.428 --> 00:36:43.129
Re-investigate?

632
00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:46.638
I'll think about it.

633
00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:48.209
All right.

634
00:36:51.178 --> 00:36:52.339
On Joo Sik.

635
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:55.308
The prosecution put pressure.

636
00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:57.948
The ministry gave authorization.

637
00:36:58.578 --> 00:37:00.448
The insurance company connived.

638
00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:04.459
The airline flew an old aircraft.

639
00:37:05.719 --> 00:37:07.089
They blamed...

640
00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:09.689
my brother for it.

641
00:37:13.799 --> 00:37:14.799
It's a good thing...

642
00:37:16.129 --> 00:37:17.939
that what On Joo Sik has...

643
00:37:18.138 --> 00:37:20.469
is a copy, not the original.

644
00:37:23.439 --> 00:37:24.439
Yes.

645
00:37:25.178 --> 00:37:26.339
I fetched it.

646
00:37:27.149 --> 00:37:29.178
Okay. I'll see you soon.

647
00:37:30.978 --> 00:37:33.888
He wants it.

648
00:37:33.888 --> 00:37:36.149
- Will you hand it over? - I will.

649
00:37:36.149 --> 00:37:38.759
Do you believe that he'll re-investigate?

650
00:37:38.759 --> 00:37:40.259
Maybe he will.

651
00:37:40.419 --> 00:37:41.728
Mr. Choi.

652
00:37:41.728 --> 00:37:42.828
I believe him,

653
00:37:42.828 --> 00:37:45.129
but not enough to hand him the real thing.

654
00:37:47.428 --> 00:37:48.428
Mr. Kim.

655
00:37:49.299 --> 00:37:50.768
Can you make another one like this?

656
00:37:51.768 --> 00:37:52.868
Mr. Kim?

657
00:37:53.399 --> 00:37:55.569
He's not Pentium.

658
00:37:56.709 --> 00:37:58.209
Pentium once said if...

659
00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.209
a detective agency was a neighborhood soccer club,

660
00:38:00.209 --> 00:38:02.109
he would be Messi.

661
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:04.848
Then I'd be Cristiano Ronaldo.

662
00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:06.419
No way.

663
00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.819
You know he bluffs.

664
00:38:10.618 --> 00:38:11.719
I'm not bluffing.

665
00:38:13.419 --> 00:38:14.989
Justice and human rights.

666
00:38:16.058 --> 00:38:17.399
We'll have to uphold them.

667
00:38:17.658 --> 00:38:19.198
How can we do that?

668
00:38:19.198 --> 00:38:20.799
Shall we...

669
00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:23.169
bark in front of the entire nation?

670
00:38:23.328 --> 00:38:24.638
Are you saying...

671
00:38:24.638 --> 00:38:26.569
you'll hold a press conference?

672
00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:27.739
That's not a bad idea.

673
00:38:28.908 --> 00:38:30.138
We should play this too.

674
00:38:30.138 --> 00:38:31.308
Should I...

675
00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:33.638
make it stand out to the reporters?

676
00:38:33.638 --> 00:38:35.748
- How? - For example,

677
00:38:35.748 --> 00:38:38.549
JH and Taeyang are trying to...

678
00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:41.589
hush the assistant pilot's brother.

679
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:44.259
JH and Taeyang? Who?

680
00:38:44.259 --> 00:38:46.518
There's a two-timer.

681
00:38:46.518 --> 00:38:49.058
- Lee Young Ho. - We'll drag him out...

682
00:38:49.058 --> 00:38:51.029
and get back at him for Pentium.

683
00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:52.828
That's too dangerous, Mr. Choi.

684
00:38:52.959 --> 00:38:54.129
Mr. Kim.

685
00:38:54.129 --> 00:38:56.629
You shouldn't put yourself on the line like that.

686
00:38:57.598 --> 00:38:59.339
I'd be in danger if I'm alone.

687
00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:01.239
But...

688
00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:05.379
I'm not alone,

689
00:39:06.379 --> 00:39:07.408
am I?

690
00:39:10.408 --> 00:39:11.649
Be careful.

691
00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:13.919
We'll back you up.

692
00:39:14.189 --> 00:39:15.448
Thank you.

693
00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:36.439
Hello, Legal Affairs Manager Lee Young Ho.

694
00:39:37.339 --> 00:39:39.138
Mr. Jan Gebauer?

695
00:39:40.908 --> 00:39:42.149
How did you know I was here?

696
00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:44.478
Well, I'm very...

697
00:39:44.478 --> 00:39:46.348
interested in you.

698
00:39:46.978 --> 00:39:48.248
Since you left JH,

699
00:39:48.248 --> 00:39:50.118
shall I call you Attorney Lee...

700
00:39:50.118 --> 00:39:51.888
instead of Legal Affairs Manager?

701
00:39:54.259 --> 00:39:56.388
I know you aren't here to get my titles straight.

702
00:39:57.089 --> 00:39:58.498
What are you doing?

703
00:39:59.428 --> 00:40:01.029
I need to ask you some questions.

704
00:40:01.029 --> 00:40:03.598
I can't stand unanswered questions.

705
00:40:04.498 --> 00:40:07.509
It's really strange.

706
00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:11.408
If you're a lawyer, you must've passed a bar.

707
00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.209
You probably have a lot of money too.

708
00:40:13.848 --> 00:40:15.248
But...

709
00:40:15.248 --> 00:40:17.248
why would you keep murdering people?

710
00:40:18.518 --> 00:40:20.419
Murdering people?

711
00:40:20.419 --> 00:40:22.689
You killed Ko Jin Chul,

712
00:40:22.919 --> 00:40:25.219
and you tried to kill me twice too.

713
00:40:25.888 --> 00:40:27.118
Why did you do that?

714
00:40:28.189 --> 00:40:29.288
By any chance,

715
00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:31.399
are you a psychopath?

716
00:40:34.969 --> 00:40:35.998
Mr. Gebauer.

717
00:40:39.268 --> 00:40:40.368
Let's assume...

718
00:40:40.368 --> 00:40:42.569
that I killed a person.

719
00:40:43.169 --> 00:40:45.538
I'd be more like a sociopath...

720
00:40:45.538 --> 00:40:47.808
than a psychopath.

721
00:40:47.808 --> 00:40:50.078
Why? Because I go to work...

722
00:40:50.078 --> 00:40:52.118
and communicate with people.

723
00:40:52.578 --> 00:40:55.748
Psychopaths are unable to do such things.

724
00:40:57.388 --> 00:40:59.518
Mr. Lee, you...

725
00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:03.158
killed people like this because you're...

726
00:41:03.158 --> 00:41:05.428
a sociopath, not psychopath.

727
00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.828
Me? No way.

728
00:41:10.098 --> 00:41:12.899
I don't kill people.

729
00:41:12.899 --> 00:41:14.169
Is that right?

730
00:41:15.408 --> 00:41:16.408
Then...

731
00:41:16.939 --> 00:41:19.678
I won't have to worry about getting killed.

732
00:41:19.678 --> 00:41:21.279
Of course.

733
00:41:22.549 --> 00:41:23.549
And...

734
00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:26.578
if I'm really a sociopath,

735
00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:30.419
don't you think...

736
00:41:30.959 --> 00:41:32.719
your behaviors are very risky?

737
00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.529
It's reassuring.

738
00:41:39.058 --> 00:41:41.098
Enjoy your meal,

739
00:41:41.268 --> 00:41:43.129
Mr. Lee Young Ho.

740
00:41:53.678 --> 00:41:55.209
I think he's really mad.

741
00:41:55.209 --> 00:41:56.748
You never disappoint us, Mr. Kim.

742
00:41:56.748 --> 00:41:59.248
He's talented in this area.

743
00:41:59.248 --> 00:42:01.888
I'm sacrificing myself at the moment.

744
00:42:01.888 --> 00:42:03.518
Can't you worry about me?

745
00:42:03.518 --> 00:42:06.259
Ha Ri, how's he doing?

746
00:42:06.259 --> 00:42:09.058
He finished his meal and is leaving the place.

747
00:42:17.839 --> 00:42:18.839
Mr. Kim.

748
00:42:18.839 --> 00:42:20.808
I think he took the bait.

749
00:42:20.808 --> 00:42:22.538
Goodness, it's scary.

750
00:42:22.538 --> 00:42:25.239
Ms. Jang, you must protect me, okay?

751
00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:27.248
Only if you shut your mouth.

752
00:42:51.169 --> 00:42:53.439
You're following me, right, Ms. Jang?

753
00:42:53.439 --> 00:42:55.268
Don't speed up too much.

754
00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:00.848
Goodness.

755
00:43:00.848 --> 00:43:03.109
He's right after me.

756
00:43:03.509 --> 00:43:05.248
(Ha Ri's camera)

757
00:43:05.518 --> 00:43:07.118
Let's just speed up.

758
00:43:07.118 --> 00:43:08.448
Slow down, Mr. Kim.

759
00:43:08.448 --> 00:43:11.158
Think of teamwork, Mr. Kim.

760
00:43:11.158 --> 00:43:14.259
You never know when he'll go out of his mind again.

761
00:43:14.388 --> 00:43:15.859
Let's take down Mr. Lee tonight...

762
00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:18.399
and hold a press conference tomorrow, okay?

763
00:43:18.698 --> 00:43:21.069
Mr. Kim, that's enough.

764
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:22.228
I'll go now.

765
00:43:22.228 --> 00:43:25.268
Goodness, please trust me and Ms. Jang.

766
00:43:25.268 --> 00:43:27.069
We can do this on ourselves.

767
00:43:27.368 --> 00:43:29.169
- Right? - Mr. Kim.

768
00:43:29.169 --> 00:43:31.239
I trust Ms. Jang.

769
00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:36.879
Mr. Choi, you trust...

770
00:43:36.879 --> 00:43:38.549
me and Ms. Jang too, right?

771
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:40.518
I trust only Ha Ri, not you.

772
00:43:40.518 --> 00:43:43.018
What are these two men doing again now?

773
00:43:43.018 --> 00:43:44.919
Stop it. It's cringy.

774
00:43:45.118 --> 00:43:47.558
Mr. Kim, don't overact.

775
00:43:47.658 --> 00:43:49.489
Ha Ri, go right behind him.

776
00:43:49.489 --> 00:43:50.498
Okay?

777
00:43:50.498 --> 00:43:51.899
- Okay. - Okay.

778
00:43:53.799 --> 00:43:54.828
What will you do?

779
00:43:54.828 --> 00:43:56.098
Keep a distance and back them up.

780
00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:57.439
Okay.

781
00:44:09.948 --> 00:44:11.919
Shall we begin?

782
00:44:12.478 --> 00:44:14.248
I'm throwing the bait now.

783
00:44:37.939 --> 00:44:39.839
He took the bait.

784
00:44:51.558 --> 00:44:54.888
(Min Joon's camera, Ha Ri's camera)

785
00:44:56.629 --> 00:44:58.299
(Min Joon's camera, Ha Ri's camera)

786
00:45:01.569 --> 00:45:02.768
I'll be there in a second.

787
00:45:04.138 --> 00:45:05.538
Slow down, Mr. Kim.

788
00:45:05.538 --> 00:45:08.509
Mr. Choi, why have you gotten so chicken-hearted?

789
00:45:09.268 --> 00:45:10.308
Hold on.

790
00:45:10.538 --> 00:45:12.509
By any chance, is Cheetah on his way?

791
00:45:16.509 --> 00:45:18.448
So you can't trust us.

792
00:45:18.448 --> 00:45:19.948
It's not that.

793
00:45:19.948 --> 00:45:22.388
You're worried and being considerate.

794
00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:25.689
Well, if that's how you take it,

795
00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:26.719
I won't mind either.

796
00:45:37.299 --> 00:45:40.439
(Min Joon's camera, Ha Ri's camera)

797
00:45:47.009 --> 00:45:48.308
Where are you now?

798
00:45:48.848 --> 00:45:52.118
I'm walking up the remote alley,

799
00:45:52.748 --> 00:45:55.219
so Mr. Lee can take the bait real good.

800
00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:56.989
(Min Joon's camera, Ha Ri's camera)

801
00:45:57.518 --> 00:45:58.589
What about you, Ha Ri?

802
00:45:58.618 --> 00:45:59.989
I'm following Mr. Lee.

803
00:46:00.689 --> 00:46:02.328
Where's he?

804
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:04.299
Mr. Kim would know...

805
00:46:08.998 --> 00:46:10.739
Turn around, Mr. Kim.

806
00:46:10.998 --> 00:46:12.038
What?

807
00:46:29.919 --> 00:46:31.259
Ms. Jang.

808
00:46:31.259 --> 00:46:32.589
- Where are you? - Ha Ri, run!

809
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:34.058
I just got off the car, Ms. Jang.

810
00:46:34.058 --> 00:46:35.158
Run!

811
00:46:54.348 --> 00:46:56.649
Where are you, Ms. Jang?

812
00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:11.799
(Ha Ri's camera)

813
00:47:11.859 --> 00:47:13.129
I'm at a dead end.

814
00:47:13.129 --> 00:47:15.629
Where are you, Mr. Kim? Soon Jung!

815
00:47:15.629 --> 00:47:17.299
I'm running to her!

816
00:47:17.299 --> 00:47:18.799
I'm coming for you.

817
00:47:18.799 --> 00:47:20.138
I'm close by.

818
00:47:20.138 --> 00:47:24.178
(Ha Ri's camera)

819
00:47:36.848 --> 00:47:38.018
It's okay.

820
00:47:39.689 --> 00:47:41.259
I'll be the bait...

821
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:43.728
instead of Mr. Kim.

822
00:47:43.828 --> 00:47:44.859
No!

823
00:47:44.859 --> 00:47:45.928
Ha Ri!

824
00:48:06.779 --> 00:48:07.788
(Ha Ri's camera)

825
00:48:09.989 --> 00:48:11.288
You little rat.

826
00:48:11.618 --> 00:48:13.489
Do you really want to die?

827
00:48:13.489 --> 00:48:14.529
Yes.

828
00:48:17.029 --> 00:48:18.058
Kill me.

829
00:48:32.279 --> 00:48:33.478
Gosh.

830
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:38.178
Will I be...

831
00:48:40.919 --> 00:48:42.149
caught red-handed then?

832
00:48:46.658 --> 00:48:47.759
Is this the police?

833
00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:50.058
I'm reporting an assault and attempted murder case.

834
00:48:50.058 --> 00:48:51.228
Please come now.

835
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:15.089
You might know well since you're a lawyer yourself.

836
00:49:15.288 --> 00:49:17.319
It's disadvantageous for you if you remain silent.

837
00:49:17.388 --> 00:49:18.388
It's okay.

838
00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:19.959
Goodness.

839
00:49:31.399 --> 00:49:32.469
That crazy jerk.

840
00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:34.339
Is he smiling at Mr. Kim?

841
00:49:34.339 --> 00:49:35.638
Does he like me that much?

842
00:49:35.638 --> 00:49:37.009
You must be happy to be so popular.

843
00:49:37.009 --> 00:49:38.109
Ms. Jang.

844
00:49:38.678 --> 00:49:40.779
I'm mad at you now.

845
00:49:40.779 --> 00:49:42.009
Don't talk to me.

846
00:49:42.609 --> 00:49:43.678
What?

847
00:49:44.078 --> 00:49:45.919
I'm a bit mad at you too.

848
00:49:46.078 --> 00:49:48.118
- What? - What if something...

849
00:49:49.018 --> 00:49:51.518
Why are you all so fearless?

850
00:49:53.689 --> 00:49:54.859
Mr. Choi.

851
00:49:57.558 --> 00:49:58.899
I kind of agree with them.

852
00:49:58.899 --> 00:50:00.259
I was crying while I was running to save you.

853
00:50:00.259 --> 00:50:01.768
I was so worried something might happen to you.

854
00:50:02.198 --> 00:50:03.368
Don't ever do that again.

855
00:50:21.049 --> 00:50:22.589
Yes, I just arrived.

856
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:24.118
I'll go straight to the office now.

857
00:50:24.719 --> 00:50:25.719
Okay, bye.

858
00:50:29.058 --> 00:50:30.158
Where are you going?

859
00:50:30.759 --> 00:50:32.328
Where are you going?

860
00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.759
I'm going for a walk.

861
00:50:33.868 --> 00:50:35.228
It's not time to go for a walk.

862
00:50:35.228 --> 00:50:37.029
They're waiting for us.

863
00:50:37.029 --> 00:50:38.598
Tell them to wait.

864
00:50:39.268 --> 00:50:41.808
Do you know how suffocating it was...

865
00:50:41.868 --> 00:50:44.109
to be locked up at his house and my office?

866
00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:47.109
When can I take a walk if not right now?

867
00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.118
Ms. Jang.

868
00:50:55.489 --> 00:50:56.649
Don't ever...

869
00:50:56.649 --> 00:50:59.018
get yourself in danger instead of me.

870
00:50:59.018 --> 00:51:00.489
I couldn't help it.

871
00:51:00.489 --> 00:51:02.359
Even if you can't,

872
00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:03.388
don't do it.

873
00:51:05.598 --> 00:51:08.169
I finally understand Mr. Choi a little.

874
00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:11.839
I see why he jumped in alone despite the danger.

875
00:51:13.498 --> 00:51:15.138
He's afraid of getting left behind...

876
00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.268
by himself.

877
00:51:16.868 --> 00:51:18.308
He really hates that.

878
00:51:19.138 --> 00:51:22.049
So are you telling me to stay behind?

879
00:51:22.308 --> 00:51:24.848
You have Mr. Choi...

880
00:51:25.078 --> 00:51:26.618
and many others around you.

881
00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:30.219
You'll be fine without me.

882
00:51:32.388 --> 00:51:33.489
Ms. Jang.

883
00:51:36.728 --> 00:51:37.859
I'm cold.

884
00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.498
I'm so cold.

885
00:51:41.998 --> 00:51:43.598
Can I have that scarf?

886
00:51:43.598 --> 00:51:44.598
What?

887
00:51:44.598 --> 00:51:45.969
You have a thick jacket on.

888
00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.969
You look like you'll be fine in a field of snow.

889
00:51:47.969 --> 00:51:49.239
Give this to me.

890
00:51:50.368 --> 00:51:51.939
- Why? - Give it to me.

891
00:51:51.939 --> 00:51:53.339
Hey, Kim Min Joon.

892
00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:56.908
Thanks.

Gosh, the comment section looks amazing.

Just as we wanted,

901
00:53:07.819 --> 00:53:11.189
the seed of doubt is beginning to sprout.

902
00:53:11.189 --> 00:53:12.959
Then we need to give them a hard proof...

903
00:53:12.959 --> 00:53:14.658
instead of mere speculation.

904
00:53:15.689 --> 00:53:16.989
We have an article, Mr. Choi.

Thanks, Mr. Choi.

I don't think...

912
00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:44.189
I'll ever forget this day.

Executive Director Cha.

918
00:54:29.928 --> 00:54:32.498
People are talking about how someone from JH,

919
00:54:32.498 --> 00:54:34.669
the former legal manager or something,

920
00:54:34.669 --> 00:54:37.408
assaulted Flight 801's co-pilot's family.

921
00:54:37.408 --> 00:54:38.439
Isn't he...

922
00:54:39.439 --> 00:54:41.448
one of Chairman Cha's people?

923
00:54:43.978 --> 00:54:46.748
You don't have the right story, Chief On.

924
00:54:47.018 --> 00:54:49.518
He's one of my people.

925
00:54:49.948 --> 00:54:52.089
And the part about his assault is...

926
00:54:52.518 --> 00:54:55.689
something that happened when he was getting...

927
00:54:56.328 --> 00:54:58.299
stalked by a delusional man.

928
00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:01.228
You were stalked by a delusional man?

929
00:55:02.129 --> 00:55:04.198
At first, he asked for money saying...

930
00:55:04.198 --> 00:55:06.169
his brother got in an industrial accident.

931
00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:08.239
We refused to pay him the compensation.

932
00:55:08.908 --> 00:55:10.408
But after I quit work,

933
00:55:10.408 --> 00:55:12.509
he started calling me a murderer.

934
00:55:12.779 --> 00:55:15.509
He suddenly popped up and called me a murderer.

935
00:55:16.879 --> 00:55:18.819
I must have lost my control for a bit.

936
00:55:19.448 --> 00:55:20.919
Do you have any proof?

937
00:55:27.428 --> 00:55:29.158
It's weird no matter how much I think about it.

938
00:55:29.158 --> 00:55:30.228
If you're a lawyer,

939
00:55:30.228 --> 00:55:32.558
you must've passed a bar.

940
00:55:32.928 --> 00:55:34.698
You probably have a lot of money too.

941
00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:38.069
But why would you keep murdering people?

942
00:55:38.339 --> 00:55:40.439
Murdering people?

943
00:55:40.439 --> 00:55:42.868
You killed Ko Jin Chul,

944
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:45.408
and you tried to kill me twice too.

945
00:55:45.739 --> 00:55:47.209
Why did you do that?

946
00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.248
By any chance,

947
00:55:50.009 --> 00:55:51.419
are you a psychopath?

948
00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:55.189
His press conference will be held very soon.

949
00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:57.518
I heard he will...

950
00:55:58.189 --> 00:55:59.919
release the original black box.

951
00:56:01.259 --> 00:56:02.759
Do you have the original black box?

952
00:56:03.288 --> 00:56:04.828
I'm not like Cheetah.

953
00:56:05.058 --> 00:56:07.058
What about me? What am I like?

954
00:56:07.799 --> 00:56:09.129
Tell him to do that.

955
00:56:09.698 --> 00:56:12.839
It's coming from a delusional guy...

956
00:56:13.198 --> 00:56:16.169
who claimed a good lawyer as a murderer.

957
00:56:16.839 --> 00:56:17.908
And he has caused some trouble...

958
00:56:18.578 --> 00:56:21.649
here and there back in Germany.

959
00:56:22.678 --> 00:56:23.919
Who would believe him?

960
00:56:23.919 --> 00:56:26.178
Are you trying to get rid of his credibility...

961
00:56:26.478 --> 00:56:29.518
to invalidate whatever he has?

962
00:56:30.689 --> 00:56:33.158
That's not enough.

963
00:56:34.558 --> 00:56:35.828
Chief On.

964
00:56:36.759 --> 00:56:38.359
You pressured...

965
00:56:38.359 --> 00:56:40.228
the Department of Transport...

966
00:56:40.629 --> 00:56:42.069
to let JH air increase their flights.

967
00:56:42.998 --> 00:56:44.638
I can erase the record for you.

968
00:56:45.198 --> 00:56:46.439
If you do that,

969
00:56:46.538 --> 00:56:48.009
what will you take in return?

970
00:56:48.439 --> 00:56:50.739
Mr. Choi gave you the black box, right?

971
00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:54.009
- Give that to me. - That's not the original.

972
00:56:54.078 --> 00:56:55.078
Yes.

973
00:56:55.649 --> 00:56:57.978
That's a fake black box,

974
00:56:58.178 --> 00:57:00.018
which Mad Dog copied illegally.

975
00:57:17.399 --> 00:57:18.768
Mr. Choi...

976
00:57:19.598 --> 00:57:21.408
got himself into something very huge.

977
00:57:32.018 --> 00:57:34.219
He used a delusional man as his pawn...

978
00:57:34.219 --> 00:57:35.618
to hold a press conference.

979
00:57:36.189 --> 00:57:38.158
Then he fabricated the proof of a tragedy...

980
00:57:38.419 --> 00:57:41.129
in which over 190 people died or got hurt.

981
00:57:44.728 --> 00:57:47.129
He made a fake black box...

982
00:57:47.129 --> 00:57:49.469
and gave it to you, Chief On.

983
00:57:50.498 --> 00:57:53.439
Do you think people will really believe that...

984
00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:56.408
the one they put out now is the original?

985
00:58:14.189 --> 00:58:16.529
He might be the family of the victim,

986
00:58:17.498 --> 00:58:19.029
but he will be...

987
00:58:20.799 --> 00:58:22.268
very hard to be forgiven.

988
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:34.109
Mr. Choi.

989
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:36.009
Stop the press conference.

990
00:58:36.578 --> 00:58:38.748
Don't play the recording. Just get out of there.

991
00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:48.058
He said that he wasn't nervous,

992
00:58:48.058 --> 00:58:49.759
but he's all frozen up.

993
00:58:51.158 --> 00:58:52.629
He's really nervous.

994
00:58:55.768 --> 00:58:56.768
Mr. Choi.

995
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:59.138
This was all Director Cha's plan.

996
00:59:11.649 --> 00:59:12.719
On Noo Ri.

997
00:59:37.178 --> 00:59:38.439
Hello.

998
00:59:39.339 --> 00:59:41.709
I'm the brother of Kim Bum Joon,

999
00:59:42.009 --> 00:59:43.408
the co-pilot of Flight 801.

1000
00:59:43.919 --> 00:59:45.219
My name is Kim Min Joon.
