00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.239
(The products and organizations have been created for the drama.)

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:10.409
(The story and its characters are fictional.)

3
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.710
(Episode 1)

4
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.980
When migratory birds come to the habitat,

5
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.439
they sleep in the afternoon...

6
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.909
and fly around after the sun sets.

7
00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.319
When you observe them up close,

8
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.019
you must whisper and walk quietly.

9
00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:26.019
Just like this.

10
00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:28.220
Take stealthy steps.

11
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.620
Do you understand?

12
00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.060
Yes.

13
00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.629
All right. Shall we whisper...

14
00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:36.629
our goodbyes to the birds?

15
00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:37.899
- Yes. - Yes.

16
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.039
Everyone, please follow me this way.

17
00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.399
- Okay. - Okay.

18
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.239
Hello. Who did you come with?

19
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.080
- With my mom and dad. - I see.

20
00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.750
- What's your name? - I'm Kwon Seung Joon.

21
00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:56.580
- I have a question. - Yes?

22
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.289
Are we not allowed to talk aloud?

23
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.159
Birds are singing loudly now.

24
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.489
When birds hear people's footsteps,

25
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.730
they sense danger and flap their wings instinctively.

26
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.799
They're exhausted after flying all the way here from Siberia.

27
00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.170
How would they feel if they can't rest because of us?

28
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.369
It'd be really horrible.

29
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.209
Exactly.

30
00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.339
That's why we must keep quiet and observe them,

31
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.110
so that they can fly when they want to.

32
00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.549
Birds don't easily get exhausted...

33
00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.080
as they fly in a flock,

34
00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.489
Miss Na Mo Hyun.

35
00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.219
- Hey, look at this. - Yes?

36
00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.630
Why is it so blurry?

37
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.929
If you take photos against the sun,

38
00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.100
you can capture the dynamic movements of the birds.

39
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.830
- It looks really nice. - Doesn't it?

40
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.140
- Try it yourself. - Thank you.

41
00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.739
Mo Hyun, all the photos I took today are out of focus.

42
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.209
I envy the guy who took photos with a huge telephoto lens.

43
00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.980
The man with a navy hat?

44
00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.480
I also wished to take a look at his pictures.

45
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.850
Kang Pil Joo

46
00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.920
(Recycle Bin)

47
00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.029
Pil Joo.

48
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.070
- Pil Joo. - Yes?

49
00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.799
Come on.

50
00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:56.469
Hey,

51
00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.040
are you already preparing for the trial?

52
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.209
- Thank you. - You'd better say that...

53
00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.219
when you're sober.

54
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.119
You know people say what's on their mind when they're drunk.

55
00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:17.930
Where are you going?

56
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.959
To turn my self in.

57
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.539
He didn't have to say that.

58
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.359
Do you need slippers to put on?

59
00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:52.760
Over there.

60
00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.630
It's been a really long time.

61
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.729
You're not in charge of this. Why are you here?

62
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.370
I had no chance...

63
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.839
to thank you about my brother...

64
00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.440
who got a job at Cheong A Motors.

65
00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.940
Hey, others might think I helped him get a job.

66
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.779
All right. What's your plan? What do you want me to do?

67
00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.490
Imprisonment.

68
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.789
The invincible Attorney Kang Pil Joo wants to be imprisoned?

69
00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:23.890
The report must be plausible.

70
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.060
Which judge will be in charge of my warrant?

71
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.500
- There he is! - He turned up!

72
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.500
- Hurry up. - This way!

73
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.200
Have you expected imprisonment?

74
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.070
Is everything that's covered by the media true?

75
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.510
Who made you turn yourself in?

76
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.510
It raised suspicion that you took the guilt...

77
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.810
of Director Jang Boo Cheon of Cheong A Trading.

78
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.950
What do you think about it?

79
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.919
- Please make a comment. - Please step aside.

80
00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.390
- Please clear the way. - Wait! Answer us.

81
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.159
The prosecution planned to summon Director Jang Boo Cheon,

82
00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.630
the grandson of Honorary Chairman Jang Kook Hwan of Cheong A Group,

83
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.899
on charges of breach of duty...

84
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.000
as he made undue profit regarding the issuance of preemptive right.

85
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.169
Attorney Kang Pil Joo from Strategy Team of Cheong A...

86
00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.240
voluntarily came to the prosecution, claiming he's responsible for it.

87
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.969
- It breaks my heart. - He's now officially arrested.

88
00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:15.810
- You must feel the same, Mom. - Reporting from Seoul...

89
00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.380
I had him stay by your side for this sort of things.

90
00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:43.339
Are you eating well?

91
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.109
You just smiled.

92
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.620
See how important I am to you?

93
00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.950
I'm the man who is capable of making...

94
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.659
this coldhearted guy smile.

95
00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:08.700
You want to know why I'm here, right?

96
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.469
I'm here to do what I have to do.

97
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.800
You told me to thank you when I'm sober.

98
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.940
- Thank you, Pil Joo. - My pleasure.

99
00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.010
Let me see.

100
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680
This is for me.

101
00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:31.250
And this is your favorite liquor.

102
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.890
If it weren't for you,

103
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.529
I would've completely lost my grandfather's favor.

104
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.370
That arrogant and stubborn Jang Yuh Cheon...

105
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.839
didn't notice it at all.

106
00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:50.440
And you're stigmatized...

107
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:52.940
as an extremely greedy jerk,

108
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.539
- which is far from you. - That's who I am.

109
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.380
I'm awfully greedy.

110
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.219
I'm full of avarice...

111
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.519
from head to toe.

112
00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:10.459
You didn't know that, did you?

113
00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:17.870
You're being sarcastic again.

114
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.909
The public will despise you,

115
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.180
saying you're a dog of Cheong A,

116
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.050
but don't you mind it.

117
00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:50.200
Goodness.

118
00:08:52.229 --> 00:08:54.270
It'll cost a lot for sure.

119
00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:03.639
What kind of jerk is he?

120
00:09:12.349 --> 00:09:15.219
All I want is your parents' phone number.

121
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.930
When they get here,

122
00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.900
I will hand you over to them,

123
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:23.530
and I'll get money from them.

124
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.599
Pil Joo can even earn money to buy his father's medicines.

125
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.879
Stop crying, you brat.

126
00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:39.580
Goodness. He's so obstinate.

127
00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:41.550
Keep a watch on him.

128
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.739
Hey, listen.

129
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.150
You know Cheong A Motors, right?

130
00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.550
- I do. - My grandfather owns the company.

131
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.450
If you help me escape from here,

132
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.820
I'll pay you handsomely later.

133
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.190
Then call your parents and tell them to bring money here.

134
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.330
He'll let you go right away then.

135
00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:29.930
The one I hate the most...

136
00:10:30.869 --> 00:10:33.570
in the world is my cousin named Jang Yuh Cheon.

137
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.900
If he finds out that I'm in trouble,

138
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:39.310
he'll tease me until I die.

139
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.550
You're saying...

140
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:48.119
you don't want to be humiliated in front of him, right?

141
00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:11.869
What do you think you're doing?

142
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.379
- Go! - Get off!

143
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.280
- I said run! Run! - Get off of me!

144
00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:24.249
How dare you try to run away?

145
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520
Hey!

146
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.560
Hey!

147
00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:37.830
Get up!

148
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.739
Wake up!

149
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.770
Please open your eyes!

150
00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:45.209
Hey!

151
00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:02.089
Hey!

152
00:12:04.459 --> 00:12:05.489
Please take a seat.

153
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.339
Who stabbed you?

154
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.410
Both of them claim they didn't stab you.

155
00:12:25.249 --> 00:12:26.280
It was him.

156
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.950
Kang Pil Joo stabbed me.

157
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.520
Have you lost your mind?

158
00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:37.060
I didn't stab you!

159
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.759
It was that jerk who stabbed you!

160
00:12:38.959 --> 00:12:40.930
Hey! Hey!

161
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.700
(Make concessions and be considerate to reform.)

162
00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:37.550
Well done.

163
00:13:38.989 --> 00:13:39.989
Good work.

164
00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:51.330
It's chilly.

165
00:13:51.969 --> 00:13:53.369
Why did you bring her here?

166
00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:55.270
Bring it.

167
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.280
I'm glad it's still warm.

168
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.050
Hold on.

169
00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:20.859
This is golden tofu.

170
00:14:21.599 --> 00:14:22.830
Make sure you eat the whole piece.

171
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.979
I already called Cheong Ah Hotel when we left.

172
00:14:37.249 --> 00:14:40.920
You must spend the first night out of prison outside.

173
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.889
Shake off all the bad energies,

174
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.589
and come home refreshed.

175
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.859
Gosh.

176
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.599
This is so cool.

177
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.670
What are you doing?

178
00:15:05.139 --> 00:15:07.339
I'm going to go see the migratory birds with my science class.

179
00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:08.639
I was just researching.

180
00:15:08.839 --> 00:15:10.280
My goodness, you're so hardworking.

181
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:12.009
By the way,

182
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.749
have you thought about the date with my brother-in-law...

183
00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:16.479
I told you about the other day?

184
00:15:18.489 --> 00:15:20.989
I'm not too keen on blind dates.

185
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.660
Blind dates are awkward.

186
00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:27.729
Then I should tell my brother-in-law to loiter...

187
00:15:27.729 --> 00:15:29.599
around the school when he's free.

188
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.369
To satisfy your fantasy of a fated encounter,

189
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.570
that's the only way.

190
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.839
Actually, I'm kind of intrigued by your suggestion.

191
00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:57.989
Mom.

192
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.629
You're going to make me buy steak when I'm only a part-time teacher?

193
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.759
Yes.

194
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.400
I'm going to make sure my daughter buys me...

195
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.930
an expensive steak from a fancy hotel.

196
00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:09.070
My goodness.

197
00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:11.209
Fine.

198
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.879
I'll treat you to a steak today.

199
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.820
Mom, since we're here, you should just order what you want.

200
00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:26.920
Okay?

201
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:29.690
We can't go back home.

202
00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:31.089
Order something decent...

203
00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:33.999
No. Just order the cheapest one.

204
00:16:33.999 --> 00:16:35.660
I'll feel bad if it's too expensive.

205
00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:38.670
My gosh, you're saying that now?

206
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.270
Stop it. Let's just order.

207
00:16:44.209 --> 00:16:45.209
Hello.

208
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.739
You're here.

209
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.609
When your dad went to Sweden to study welfare policies,

210
00:16:52.609 --> 00:16:54.520
he had a Korean professor.

211
00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:59.589
Oh, right. I heard he came back after he retired.

212
00:16:59.889 --> 00:17:01.889
He's the nephew of the professor.

213
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.629
Bye then.

214
00:17:04.889 --> 00:17:06.460
Don't you embarrass me.

215
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.500
Mom.

216
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.530
Mom!

217
00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:16.800
May I sit?

218
00:17:17.139 --> 00:17:19.710
Of course. Please sit for the time being.

219
00:17:22.409 --> 00:17:23.980
I think I dodged the worst scenario.

220
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.109
- Sorry? - I was told you might not...

221
00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.820
let me sit down or you might leave the restaurant.

222
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.790
I heard you hate blind dates and setups.

223
00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:35.119
Well, it's my fault.

224
00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:37.530
I should have put up a sign...

225
00:17:38.189 --> 00:17:40.189
that I hate blind dates and setups.

226
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.629
Why do you hate them so much?

227
00:17:41.659 --> 00:17:43.500
When I go on blind dates,

228
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.399
it's the same as starting a relationship...

229
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.139
based on the reputation of my father, mother, and me.

230
00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:51.240
I heard there was this rich guy...

231
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.740
who wanted to marry me because of my father's reputation.

232
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.810
A politician's family and family with money.

233
00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.780
A marriage where the parents are more important than the couple...

234
00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.980
isn't what I want.

235
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.490
I came here for a steak.

236
00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.320
Why don't you join me? It's on me.

237
00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:12.790
Please get in. Let me give you a ride.

238
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.349
Yes, Mom.

239
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.550
You didn't embarrass me, did you?

240
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.349
No way. I paid for the steaks.

241
00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:38.089
The professor called his nephew.

242
00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:40.720
It seems like his nephew painted you in a good light.

243
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.520
Of course.

244
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.689
Mom, I'm pretty cool.

245
00:18:45.689 --> 00:18:48.300
I heard you guys hit it off. What did you guys talk about?

246
00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:51.070
Our first love.

247
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.800
We both had our first love in middle school.

248
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.800
But Mom, shouldn't you be busy?

249
00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:58.510
We're on break now.

250
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.710
Hey, here's the thing.

251
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.179
Just go out with him a few times. No pressure.

252
00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:03.679
- I'm hanging up now. - Mo Hyun!

253
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.770
Hey.

254
00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:26.030
Did you get beat up in lock-up?

255
00:19:26.429 --> 00:19:28.339
You looked like you were...

256
00:19:28.869 --> 00:19:30.939
venting after you got beat up.

257
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.409
His name was...

258
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.050
Jo In Ho.

259
00:19:39.379 --> 00:19:43.179
I don't remember a lot about the girl I liked in middle school.

260
00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:45.419
You must have really liked him.

261
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.530
I would have used a different word than "liked".

262
00:19:52.089 --> 00:19:55.159
It feels like I should meet him at least once.

263
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.030
Like fate.

264
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.689
(Literature)

265
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:34.439
(Jo In Ho)

266
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.290
Congressman Na Gi Chul.

267
00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:57.159
You think he could win the candidacy for the presidential election?

268
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.399
Pil Joo, look.

269
00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:02.129
What do you think?

270
00:21:02.399 --> 00:21:04.899
The daughter of Congressman Na and Jang Boo Cheon.

271
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.330
Do they look good together?

272
00:21:08.369 --> 00:21:10.810
We should make sure they do.

273
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:14.210
All right. We must make them marry each other.

274
00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:16.439
It would be better if they looked good together.

275
00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:20.720
What happened to the DNA result of Kim Yoo Chul?

276
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.080
Oh, right. I have it.

277
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.290
Here you go.

278
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.760
Chairman Jang Kook Hwan and Kim Yoo Chul...

279
00:21:29.859 --> 00:21:32.060
are not biologically related.

280
00:21:32.689 --> 00:21:33.899
Kim Yoo Chul...

281
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.530
has been going around every hospital. He's still in the dark...

282
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.000
that Chairman Jang's DNA result has been modified.

283
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.199
The result will be the same whichever hospital he goes.

284
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.320
(Estimated assessed individual land price after installing IC)

285
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.550
(Present condition of Cheong A Group land possession)

286
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.919
Once the interchange construction completes,

287
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.429
10km ramp will be reduced to 2km.

288
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.199
Our land price will jump about 40 times, Father.

289
00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.000
The isolated land...

290
00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:13.099
will finally connect.

291
00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:14.740
You've done a great job.

292
00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:16.369
Not at all, Father.

293
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.310
Yuh Cheon's father-in-law, Chairman Lee of Hanmin Daily helped us a lot.

294
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.849
He led the media to focus on it and manipulate the public...

295
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.780
that the interchange that all previous governments were against...

296
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.250
is finally approved.

297
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.750
My grandson made a great choice in his marriage...

298
00:22:31.889 --> 00:22:33.589
for the future of Cheong A.

299
00:22:35.419 --> 00:22:38.129
Thanks to you,

300
00:22:38.129 --> 00:22:39.859
he picked a great wife for him.

301
00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:43.530
Show up, Jang Kook Hwan!

302
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.199
Father, I'm here!

303
00:22:46.429 --> 00:22:47.869
Show up, Jang Kook Hwan!

304
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:49.839
Calm down, and get down here.

305
00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:51.609
We can talk about it after you come down.

306
00:22:51.609 --> 00:22:54.010
Don't come close or I'll jump.

307
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.240
I'm going to jump. Don't come!

308
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.179
Gosh. Come here, Jang Kook Hwan!

309
00:22:59.609 --> 00:23:01.780
Where is Jang Kook Hwan?

310
00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:03.580
- No pictures. - Father!

311
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.220
I'm here!

312
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.820
- Calm down. - Please don't.

313
00:23:07.089 --> 00:23:09.790
You need to come down. Let's talk here.

314
00:23:11.129 --> 00:23:12.159
Everyone, leave.

315
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.530
I'll see you later.

316
00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:18.000
You know where I'm talking about, right?

317
00:23:23.139 --> 00:23:24.770
Is he Kang Pil Joo?

318
00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:27.580
Cheong A Group owner's favorite lawyer?

319
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.810
Favorite, my foot.

320
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.849
He's just the owner's dog who does everything the owner orders.

321
00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:35.949
A hunting dog.

322
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.419
Kim Yoo Chul.

323
00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:03.810
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

324
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:06.109
I said I'll jump off the roof...

325
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:08.820
on the day Jang Kook Hwan comes to work.

326
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.449
- Did you think I was joking? - No.

327
00:24:12.389 --> 00:24:13.649
That's why I want to help you.

328
00:24:15.089 --> 00:24:16.859
Hey, you. Don't.

329
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.990
What are you doing? Don't come. Don't come!

330
00:24:26.429 --> 00:24:28.000
You got a lot of money...

331
00:24:28.869 --> 00:24:32.240
to live as Kim Yoo Chul instead of Jang Yoo Chul.

332
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.080
You can't say it wasn't fair.

333
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.879
Honorary Chairman Jang...

334
00:24:37.349 --> 00:24:39.810
will be very upset to hear this.

335
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.119
He's still my father.

336
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.820
How could he...

337
00:24:44.589 --> 00:24:47.889
- cover this up with money... - We tested DNA.

338
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.730
It said you're not his son.

339
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.830
You manipulated the result!

340
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.699
I want to get tested again.

341
00:24:56.659 --> 00:24:59.330
Gosh. Kim Yoo Chul.

342
00:24:59.669 --> 00:25:00.800
It's no use.

343
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.970
No matter how many times you get tested,

344
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.139
you'll get the same result.

345
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:12.250
You know it.

346
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.859
Kim Yoo Chul.

347
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.629
Is there anything else you need?

348
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.669
Do you want to do it one more time?

349
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.290
You're always so fast.

350
00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:59.730
Is it ready already?

351
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.970
This is the scene of Jang Yoo Chul trying to jump off.

352
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.070
We can talk about the memory card...

353
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.510
after you pay me.

354
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:19.149
Let me go.

355
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.929
How dare you beat a reporter?

356
00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:55.649
Hey.

357
00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.490
Do you want me to send those photos to your daughter and wife...

358
00:27:00.589 --> 00:27:01.619
in the Philippines?

359
00:27:02.859 --> 00:27:04.230
Bring me the memory card.

360
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Take this.

361
00:27:13.369 --> 00:27:16.070
- Do you want to know why I hit you? - Yes.

362
00:27:16.439 --> 00:27:18.540
We could've just talked.

363
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.639
Everyone in your company including the editor-in-chief...

364
00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.409
got paid by us for decades.

365
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.980
You know it's not going to be on the newspaper,

366
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.389
but you still took the photos and wrote the article.

367
00:27:34.159 --> 00:27:35.960
That means I was only a joke to you.

368
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.960
I can't stand that.

369
00:27:41.399 --> 00:27:43.800
If I just tell people that I can't stand it,

370
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:46.730
they don't get it.

371
00:27:55.639 --> 00:27:56.839
Do you get it?

372
00:28:01.849 --> 00:28:02.919
I'll see you later.

373
00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.669
Don't miss it.

374
00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:22.470
Yes. It's time.

375
00:28:23.099 --> 00:28:24.409
Bring it up.

376
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.889
Father. I'm here.

377
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.760
He's eating raw wild ginseng.

378
00:28:48.199 --> 00:28:51.330
He must eat it at this hour as soon as the sun rises.

379
00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:54.439
- How long is that going to take? - He just ate it.

380
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:57.839
He must chew it slowly for about 30 minutes.

381
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.480
He must lie down after he's done.

382
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.750
He becomes very tired...

383
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.250
after he eats it raw.

384
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.520
He must sleep...

385
00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:13.820
for about an hour to recover.

386
00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:18.429
I didn't know we got wild ginseng. Where's it from?

387
00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.099
My brother tried very hard to get it.

388
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.699
He's very fond of it...

389
00:29:25.699 --> 00:29:28.139
because it's 100 years old.

390
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.510
100 years is no problem.

391
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.669
He's looking forward to live for 120 years.

392
00:29:34.109 --> 00:29:35.280
He's very happy.

393
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:37.679
Hey, Ms. Han.

394
00:29:39.679 --> 00:29:41.419
Do you want to get kicked out stripped off?

395
00:29:44.589 --> 00:29:46.949
I'm not interested in your brother,

396
00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.760
but if you act like you're part of Cheong A,

397
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:52.689
I won't allow it.

398
00:29:53.899 --> 00:29:57.030
I'm only bearing it because my dear late mother-in-law told me...

399
00:29:57.699 --> 00:30:00.740
to pity you when she herself prayed her whole life before she died.

400
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.839
If I were you, I'd be grateful that I can feed my children.

401
00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.179
I'd live quietly by not looking for any opportunities...

402
00:30:08.179 --> 00:30:10.780
and live like I'm a nobody.

403
00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:16.080
Who do you think you are to look me in the eye?

404
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.490
Do you think you can become more influential with wild ginseng?

405
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.859
Can't you see it?

406
00:30:23.089 --> 00:30:25.859
Do you want me to show you where your place is?

407
00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:29.199
Ms. Han.

408
00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.869
Do you understand what I mean?

409
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.540
- Ms. Han. - I do.

410
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.710
Does he need to sleep for an hour?

411
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.179
Yes.

412
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.710
Bring me some tea.

413
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.520
I want it with ice.

414
00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.520
Attorney Kang.

415
00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:53.760
I guess you've dealt with it.

416
00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.159
Good job.

417
00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:58.089
I asked him...

418
00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.060
because a beggar asked for money...

419
00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.330
even before breakfast.

420
00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:07.399
- Get her tea now. - Yes.

421
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.240
Grandfather.

422
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.080
I'm home.

423
00:31:15.679 --> 00:31:17.280
You're early.

424
00:31:17.349 --> 00:31:19.050
I left early to be on time.

425
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.879
I didn't know you were here.

426
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.490
"Hello, ma'am."

427
00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.560
"How have you been?"

428
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.159
That's what you must say first.

429
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.560
Do you understand, Yuh Cheon?

430
00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:36.300
- Yes. I'm sorry. - Get in, Yuh Cheon.

431
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.129
Since you're here, come in.

432
00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:48.385
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E01 Money Flower "A Loyal Servant"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

433
00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:56.379
That jerk.

434
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.520
So...

435
00:31:59.449 --> 00:32:01.990
Grandfather called Jang Yuh Cheon, that idiot?

436
00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.060
And I'm out here when Grandfather didn't even call me?

437
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.260
Why does that matter so much?

438
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.429
Then what else matters?

439
00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:10.669
It's important...

440
00:32:12.129 --> 00:32:13.869
that you're doomed.

441
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.270
What?

442
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.679
What? I should hand over Daeil Distribution to Yuh Cheon?

443
00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:24.149
Grandfather, Daeil Distribution...

444
00:32:24.379 --> 00:32:26.780
was passed on to me by my father when he passed away.

445
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.879
My parents raised money...

446
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.849
for the inheritance tax.

447
00:32:30.849 --> 00:32:33.960
Of course they have to pay for it. What does it have to do with me?

448
00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.060
For now, pay the market value of the company...

449
00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:39.830
based on the time when Boo Cheon got the company.

450
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.060
- Father. - Grandfather.

451
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.830
Excuse me, Grandfather.

452
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.800
His father passed away when I was five.

453
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.800
We can't pay the market value of that time.

454
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:52.510
- Attorney Kang. - Yes.

455
00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.080
Isn't it illegal...

456
00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.780
to buy shares at a giveaway price even if they're not listed?

457
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.750
It's against the Capital Markets Act.

458
00:32:59.349 --> 00:33:02.780
Attorney Kang will take care of it somehow.

459
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:14.859
Yuh Cheon.

460
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.300
Hey, Jang Yuh Cheon! You jerk!

461
00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.570
- Follow me. - Get off me.

462
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.609
You could have stayed at your place. Attorney Kang...

463
00:33:29.609 --> 00:33:32.250
would have told you what's going on anyway.

464
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.089
Take care of yourself.

465
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:46.290
Why aren't you answering me?

466
00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:49.730
Do you still want to work for Boo Cheon?

467
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:52.169
I'll think about it, sir.

468
00:33:52.169 --> 00:33:54.899
You should root for the winning side.

469
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.139
You know Boo Cheon has no prospect of success.

470
00:33:58.369 --> 00:33:59.770
I don't think so.

471
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.240
Gosh, you're lying.

472
00:34:02.409 --> 00:34:03.409
Hey.

473
00:34:03.639 --> 00:34:05.909
Do you look down on me just because I'm old?

474
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:07.550
That's not true, sir.

475
00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.920
That stupid idiot.

476
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.690
He's still like a 15-year-old boy.

477
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:14.159
He's not growing up.

478
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.920
He barely finished school...

479
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.360
thanks to you.

480
00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:21.599
If you're trying to repay Director Jung...

481
00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.199
for taking care of you...

482
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.299
when you had nowhere to go,

483
00:34:25.529 --> 00:34:27.000
you've done enough already.

484
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.069
You even went to jail in place of Boo Cheon.

485
00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.909
Kang Pil Joo went to jail just for money?

486
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.549
Don't even expect me to believe that.

487
00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:43.049
You could've pocketed that much money without getting caught anyway.

488
00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:46.619
Gosh.

489
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.119
You thief.

490
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.290
You didn't even refuse Daeil Distribution Grandfather offered.

491
00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.060
It's not yours to begin with.

492
00:34:54.099 --> 00:34:56.099
There are tons of companies who offer better prices out there.

493
00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:58.429
But we use your company regardless of the price.

494
00:34:58.429 --> 00:35:00.099
That's how your company has grown.

495
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.969
We've been criticized for supporting your company the whole time.

496
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.369
Why would you think it's yours?

497
00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:05.509
What?

498
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.380
So...

499
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.849
are you jealous?

500
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:12.650
Of course I am.

501
00:35:12.949 --> 00:35:14.779
If the company goes public, you get all the credit.

502
00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:16.250
But you've done nothing.

503
00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:18.119
Are you kidding me?

504
00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:22.090
Gosh.

505
00:35:23.759 --> 00:35:25.429
You jerk!

506
00:35:26.529 --> 00:35:28.799
Darn it.

507
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.770
Darn it!

508
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.469
Wait.

509
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:38.440
Since when have you been watching us?

510
00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:41.179
Since when Yuh Cheon said he was jealous.

511
00:35:41.179 --> 00:35:44.310
Hey, you should've stopped him then.

512
00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.179
Grandfather told you to abandon Boo Cheon and work for me, right?

513
00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:50.150
What?

514
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.449
Starting from tomorrow...

515
00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:53.389
I told him I'd think about it.

516
00:35:53.389 --> 00:35:55.119
What do you mean you'd think about it?

517
00:35:57.159 --> 00:35:59.659
Why would you even think about it?

518
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:01.360
Whoever wins here,

519
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.529
I'll side with the winner.

520
00:36:03.529 --> 00:36:05.670
Are you kidding me?

521
00:36:05.699 --> 00:36:07.170
Pil Joo, come on.

522
00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:11.170
Darn it!

523
00:36:11.239 --> 00:36:13.210
You jerk!

524
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.009
You stupid idiot.

525
00:36:17.009 --> 00:36:18.049
You scumbag.

526
00:36:18.049 --> 00:36:19.310
Stop it!

527
00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:24.049
Gosh, you...

528
00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:25.849
Stop it!

529
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.590
You jerk.

530
00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:42.440
Come here!

531
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.150
You idiot!

532
00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.029
Oh, gosh.

533
00:37:13.969 --> 00:37:15.000
Hey!

534
00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:31.250
Hey, run!

535
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:16.730
Jang Boo Cheon.

536
00:38:18.869 --> 00:38:20.230
Be my friend.

537
00:38:21.369 --> 00:38:23.170
You jerk!

538
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:24.969
Hey!

539
00:38:31.279 --> 00:38:33.009
You stupid...

540
00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.029
I won.

541
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:17.330
Hey.

542
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.060
Are you going out on business?

543
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.659
Yes. I'm going to the factory in Suwon.

544
00:39:24.529 --> 00:39:27.440
I heard about Daeil Distribution from Yuh Cheon.

545
00:39:28.869 --> 00:39:31.239
Even if Chairman Jang pushes ahead with the plan,

546
00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.679
it's not something we can get it done overnight.

547
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.119
Don't beat yourself up.

548
00:39:41.219 --> 00:39:42.380
Okay.

549
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.449
All right.

550
00:40:08.909 --> 00:40:11.810
Gosh, I left my phone in the car.

551
00:40:20.489 --> 00:40:21.520
(Reference Library)

552
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.420
- Hello. - Hello.

553
00:41:24.319 --> 00:41:25.520
Chairman Jang is here.

554
00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:28.860
Who's here?

555
00:41:34.429 --> 00:41:36.429
Father, what are you doing here?

556
00:41:36.759 --> 00:41:37.900
Well...

557
00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:40.540
They asked me to have a seat, but I said no.

558
00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:42.969
Go sit over there and wait.

559
00:41:43.299 --> 00:41:44.310
Okay.

560
00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.710
Come in.

561
00:41:47.779 --> 00:41:49.480
I have something important to tell you.

562
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.750
Executive Jung,

563
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.520
You know how straightforward I am...

564
00:41:58.520 --> 00:41:59.650
better than anyone.

565
00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:01.860
And I have...

566
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:04.090
been thinking about this for a couple of days,

567
00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.360
and couldn't bring it up when I met you earlier today.

568
00:42:06.429 --> 00:42:09.199
I hope you understand that it wasn't an easy decision.

569
00:42:10.369 --> 00:42:12.369
Let me get to the point.

570
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.199
I need you to move out of this house.

571
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.710
Yuh Cheon will succeed his father...

572
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:20.310
and become the chairman soon,

573
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.779
so I need to train him here beside me.

574
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.779
Father, I can't do that.

575
00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.949
I'm not asking you to move out right away.

576
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.250
I'm telling you this now so that you have time to find a good place.

577
00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:34.489
I need you to prepare to move out.

578
00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.690
You made Boo Cheon's dad...

579
00:42:36.259 --> 00:42:37.960
encounter sudden death,

580
00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:40.290
and now you plan to throw me and my son out?

581
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:44.230
No way. I'm not throwing you out onto the street.

582
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:45.670
Father!

583
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.770
I'm sure he'll let others take over his house...

584
00:42:50.369 --> 00:42:53.069
over his dead body.

585
00:42:53.139 --> 00:42:55.080
That's why he decided...

586
00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.250
to come here himself.

587
00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.580
I have no idea why he doesn't like Director Jang.

588
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:04.520
He's the son of his eldest son. Who else can carry on the family name?

589
00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:08.319
Huge companies like Cheong A put individual's competency...

590
00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.830
over blood ties.

591
00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.889
Now that you run a few restaurants in Cheong A Department store,

592
00:43:12.889 --> 00:43:14.400
you sound like a businesswoman.

593
00:43:15.199 --> 00:43:17.670
You earned quite a lot...

594
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:19.069
for entertaining Chairman at night.

595
00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:21.770
Maybe not.

596
00:43:25.009 --> 00:43:26.469
You made it clear...

597
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.880
that Seong Man temporarily takes up the president post...

598
00:43:28.909 --> 00:43:30.949
only until Boo Cheon grows up.

599
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:32.949
You told Boo Cheon to grow up...

600
00:43:33.049 --> 00:43:35.920
and take over the title from Seong Man...

601
00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:37.949
as Cheong A must be run...

602
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:39.819
by the eldest grandson.

603
00:43:39.819 --> 00:43:42.520
- Calm down. - Father.

604
00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:46.029
Boo Cheon is fully grown up. He's already 32.

605
00:43:46.029 --> 00:43:48.099
It's only his body that grew up.

606
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.670
He's not only narrow-minded...

607
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.069
but also incompetent.

608
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:54.340
Why are you so dissatisfied with him?

609
00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.639
If you tell me the reason,

610
00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.469
I'll make sure that he corrects it...

611
00:43:59.639 --> 00:44:01.210
- by all means. - Mal Lan,

612
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.080
we're living in the 21st century.

613
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.779
Stop the nonsense.

614
00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.849
Cheong A lies before my oldest grandson.

615
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.520
Don't you dare to stand against me.

616
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:13.650
Go raise your kid as a decent man.

617
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.830
Find a place to live in with Boo Cheon.

618
00:44:19.989 --> 00:44:22.259
Yuh Cheon wants to live with you in here,

619
00:44:22.299 --> 00:44:23.900
and we do have spare rooms.

620
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.599
But it'll be stressful for you to live with Yuh Cheon...

621
00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:28.869
in the same house.

622
00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:49.090
Chairman told her to move out...

623
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:50.690
as soon as possible.

624
00:44:52.029 --> 00:44:54.099
I can't even stay near her...

625
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:56.099
as I don't know how to face her.

626
00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.480
I'm here.

627
00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.199
Do not let anyone in...

628
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.670
- including Boo Cheon. - Yes, sir.

629
00:45:50.389 --> 00:45:51.920
I'm sure there is a way.

630
00:45:52.949 --> 00:45:54.159
There must be a way.

631
00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.489
If unlocked the door...

632
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.929
just to console me, leave.

633
00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:05.830
I'll make Boo Cheon...

634
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:08.770
marry the daughter of Congressman Na Gi Chul.

635
00:46:10.099 --> 00:46:11.469
He's most likely...

636
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.210
to be the next president.

637
00:46:21.279 --> 00:46:23.480
The land in Gangwon Province that Chairman owns...

638
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.250
The useless land that's really far from the interchange...

639
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.159
- of the highway? - The permit to construct...

640
00:46:28.659 --> 00:46:30.790
interchange right in front of the land will be issued soon.

641
00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:33.389
None of the previous administrations issued the permit...

642
00:46:33.429 --> 00:46:36.659
due to extremely low traffic volumes.

643
00:46:37.929 --> 00:46:38.929
But...

644
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.900
- Yuh Cheon's father-in-law... - So Chairman of Hanmin Daily...

645
00:46:43.099 --> 00:46:44.509
succeeded to obtain the permit...

646
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.670
after stirring up public opinion.

647
00:46:46.739 --> 00:46:48.009
You need...

648
00:46:48.679 --> 00:46:50.310
in-laws who can bring...

649
00:46:50.549 --> 00:46:54.420
Cheong A more profit than Chairman Lee of Hanmin Daily.

650
00:46:55.449 --> 00:46:56.779
That's the only option you have.

651
00:46:56.819 --> 00:46:58.690
He's so shameless and disgraceful.

652
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.659
He'd even willingly sell his soul...

653
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.029
to the devil if he can make profits.

654
00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.000
You'll provide Congressman Na with political funds,

655
00:47:11.469 --> 00:47:14.440
and he will lobby the National Assembly...

656
00:47:14.599 --> 00:47:17.639
to pass the bills that are favorable to Cheong A.

657
00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:22.639
Moreover, he'll get you the permit to construct...

658
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.849
Cheong A Tower,

659
00:47:25.049 --> 00:47:27.080
the lifelong dream of Honorary Chairman Jang.

660
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.420
Cheong A Tower?

661
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.420
The permit to construct an interchange is nothing.

662
00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.759
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

663
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.190
I wouldn't have had to swallow such insults.

664
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.799
I was going to tell you...

665
00:47:42.029 --> 00:47:43.560
once everything is thoroughly prepared.

666
00:47:44.869 --> 00:47:46.770
How much will Cheong A gain through this marriage?

667
00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.469
It will be...

668
00:47:49.369 --> 00:47:52.409
over 200 billion dollars for the next 30 years.

669
00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.980
Sit down.

670
00:48:06.819 --> 00:48:08.989
- Did you check up on his daughter? - Yes.

671
00:48:09.619 --> 00:48:11.489
What is the biggest obstacle?

672
00:48:11.489 --> 00:48:13.330
She doesn't prefer blind dates...

673
00:48:13.699 --> 00:48:16.099
and wants to get married with a man she loves.

674
00:48:17.469 --> 00:48:18.900
So I should let...

675
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.400
such a foolish girl in my house?

676
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:26.639
So what is your plan?

677
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.440
I'll make his daughter and Boo Cheon fall for each other...

678
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.679
and lead them to get married in the end.

679
00:48:32.779 --> 00:48:34.849
- Is that possible? - Making the impossible possible...

680
00:48:35.049 --> 00:48:36.219
is my job.

681
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:38.190
Is Boo Cheon seeing anyone these days?

682
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:39.819
No.

683
00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:49.860
Gosh!

684
00:48:51.369 --> 00:48:52.799
I need to go.

685
00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:07.250
My goodness.

686
00:49:18.429 --> 00:49:20.929
His approval ratings marked 34.2 percent,

687
00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:23.230
standing at 46.4 percent in aggregate.

688
00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:26.270
Candidate Lee Cheol Yong is elected as the presidential candidate...

689
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:28.239
of Shindaehan Party.

690
00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:31.110
Lee Cheol Yong is elected...

691
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:34.710
as the final presidential candidate of Shindaehan Party.

692
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:37.250
The presidential nomination of the ruling party...

693
00:49:37.279 --> 00:49:39.110
was held today, and Lee Cheol Yong beat...

694
00:49:39.179 --> 00:49:40.949
Na Gi Chul against expectations.

695
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:43.889
- Dad... - Candidate Na Gi Chul had been...

696
00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:47.119
the leading candidate throughout the campaign, but he lost...

697
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:48.489
at the election of the presidential electoral college.

698
00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.159
Many expected that he'd resign his membership in the party,

699
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:54.529
but Candidate Na admitted his defeat...

700
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.130
and accepted the result.

701
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:59.599
I think he's quite upset.

702
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.400
I'm sure the fact that the advocates within the party turned away...

703
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.069
is even more painful.

704
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.150
Immediately after Congressman Na announced his concession,

705
00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:13.980
Candidate Lee Cheol Yong offered him the chief campaigner position.

706
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.980
What was Congressman Na's answer?

707
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.090
He didn't make an official announcement yet.

708
00:50:18.219 --> 00:50:19.449
It must be a very tough decision.

709
00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:21.020
Congressman Na can neither easily accept...

710
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.090
nor decline the offer.

711
00:50:23.119 --> 00:50:25.529
He must be grappling...

712
00:50:25.529 --> 00:50:26.989
with the two options.

713
00:50:27.299 --> 00:50:30.630
He has to choose either to quit or remain in the party.

714
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.110
Welcome, Congressman Na.

715
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.840
It's been a long time, Executive Jung.

716
00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.639
We met at the event of Cheong A Welfare Foundation.

717
00:51:48.679 --> 00:51:49.940
It's been two years.

718
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.009
I know.

719
00:51:51.909 --> 00:51:52.909
All right.

720
00:51:55.819 --> 00:51:57.790
I'm sorry to invite you through the back door.

721
00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:01.790
He did a good job guiding me here.

722
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.529
I didn't meet anyone on my way.

723
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.639
Please don't worry.

724
00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:19.540
He's like my eyes and ears.

725
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.540
Please make yourself comfortable...

726
00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:24.409
and think he's another Jung Mal Lan.

727
00:52:24.409 --> 00:52:26.880
You're already too much for me.

728
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.319
And now there's one more of you?

729
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:32.020
Let's play fair and square.

730
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:36.420
Can you step out?

731
00:53:02.719 --> 00:53:04.090
People say...

732
00:53:04.819 --> 00:53:07.960
you would've won if you spent only one-tenth...

733
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.219
of the money Candidate Lee did.

734
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:11.730
It's all water under the bridge.

735
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:13.860
Will you accept...

736
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:15.900
the position of Chief Campaigner...

737
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.699
Candidate Lee Cheol Yong's offered?

738
00:53:17.799 --> 00:53:18.869
I'm not sure.

739
00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:23.500
Well...

740
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:27.239
I don't think you invited me here to talk about that.

741
00:53:27.239 --> 00:53:28.279
Congressman Na.

742
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:30.239
Can we...

743
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.650
play Truth or Dare?

744
00:53:34.319 --> 00:53:36.480
I'll guess what worries you.

745
00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.920
And you'll...

746
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:40.190
guess why I wanted to meet you today.

747
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:43.860
So what do you think worries me?

748
00:53:44.259 --> 00:53:45.960
"Can I really...

749
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.960
become president...

750
00:53:50.159 --> 00:53:53.799
of this country without money five years later?"

751
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.679
So what do you think is the truth about me?

752
00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.449
I'm not sure.

753
00:54:04.449 --> 00:54:06.949
I want to take back Cheong A Group...

754
00:54:06.949 --> 00:54:08.880
from my brother-in-law President Jang Seong Man...

755
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.489
and give it to my son.

756
00:54:13.489 --> 00:54:14.489
Sir.

757
00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:17.389
My son Jang Boo Cheon needs someone...

758
00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.029
to count on.

759
00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.460
Then I'll make you...

760
00:54:24.469 --> 00:54:25.529
the president...

761
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.699
of this country five years later.

762
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.310
I'll have my son go out with your daughter.

763
00:54:39.179 --> 00:54:40.310
Mo Hyun wouldn't even want to...

764
00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.049
have a relationship with a son of a conglomerate.

765
00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:45.690
But how?

766
00:54:46.619 --> 00:54:48.460
We can't even force them to get married.

767
00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:52.259
How would you have them fall in love to begin with?

768
00:54:52.259 --> 00:54:54.330
Just please pretend not to know anything.

769
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.000
I'll take care of everything.

770
00:55:00.869 --> 00:55:02.099
I may sound...

771
00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:04.270
too hasty to you.

772
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:07.009
I'm sorry, but I don't put on a front.

773
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:12.110
Then let me put it this way.

774
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:16.219
I'll have them fall deeply in love with each other...

775
00:55:16.319 --> 00:55:18.819
just like you did with your wife.

776
00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.420
I want you to retire from politics...

777
00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.889
after reaching a pinnacle.

778
00:55:27.159 --> 00:55:28.400
I'll try my best...

779
00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.869
so my son Boo Cheon...

780
00:55:31.929 --> 00:55:34.170
will be a president's son-in-law.

781
00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:46.049
- Let's eat. - Yes, ma'am.

782
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:50.989
I'm counting on you...

783
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:53.690
for this marriage.

784
00:55:54.719 --> 00:55:56.560
I want you to remember...

785
00:55:57.429 --> 00:55:59.560
that you're saving my life and Boo Cheon's.

786
00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.529
Okay.

787
00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:04.199
It's been long since we ate together.

788
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:08.099
Mom.

789
00:56:09.069 --> 00:56:10.670
Why did you want to see me?

790
00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:19.210
Why are you so serious?

791
00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.349
Did Grandfather force you to sell Daeil Distribution again?

792
00:56:23.449 --> 00:56:25.489
We'll keep Daeil Distribution.

793
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:28.889
I knew you'd have a plan.

794
00:56:28.989 --> 00:56:31.389
Pil Joo's plan is to have you get married.

795
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:32.730
What?

796
00:56:33.799 --> 00:56:35.630
Let's have him begin his relationship...

797
00:56:35.799 --> 00:56:37.699
with Na Mo Hyun in 15 days.

798
00:56:39.469 --> 00:56:40.540
What?

799
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.369
What did you say?

800
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:45.239
Who's Na Mo Hyun?

801
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:47.779
A woman you'll fall in love and get married with.

802
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:50.779
She's Congressman Na Gi Chul's daughter.

803
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:53.849
Are you insane?

804
00:56:54.179 --> 00:56:55.480
Is this mating or something?

805
00:56:56.319 --> 00:56:57.819
You go out with her!

806
00:56:58.449 --> 00:57:00.020
You get married with her as well!

807
00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.830
You should go persuade Boo Cheon...

808
00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:09.000
I'll quit.

809
00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:10.670
I'm out of this.

810
00:57:11.469 --> 00:57:12.500
What?

811
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.000
If Boo Cheon doesn't want me desperately,

812
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:17.610
I won't be able to go through...

813
00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:19.840
all the difficulties ahead of me,

814
00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:21.840
Executive Jung.

815
00:57:42.699 --> 00:57:43.900
How dare he...

816
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:50.409
I'm sick of him being so condescending.

817
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:52.139
Just let him go.

818
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:54.540
I'll decide when he leaves.

819
00:57:55.679 --> 00:57:58.549
You can't get Cheong A Group without Pil Joo.

820
00:57:58.549 --> 00:58:01.279
Mom, your son isn't that bad.

821
00:58:01.449 --> 00:58:02.980
I can do it without Pil Joo.

822
00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.489
He's served as your right-hand man...

823
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:08.819
being a bulldozer and a slop bucket. It's impossible...

824
00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.489
to meet a man like that again.

825
00:58:10.489 --> 00:58:11.830
He's not my right-hand man.

826
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:14.330
He actually looks down on me.

827
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.659
He's...

828
00:58:16.429 --> 00:58:17.699
your servant anyway.

829
00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:19.429
And you're the master.

830
00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:30.849
Pil Joo.

831
00:58:39.489 --> 00:58:40.759
You crazy jerk.

832
00:58:41.259 --> 00:58:42.489
He already left.

833
00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:47.199
Where are you going?

834
00:58:52.469 --> 00:58:54.139
I want to go observe some migratory birds.

835
00:58:54.199 --> 00:58:57.540
Gosh, you observed a lot of birds because of Na Mo Hyun.

836
00:58:57.639 --> 00:58:58.869
Aren't you even tired of it?

837
00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.710
I never got to see the birds.

838
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.650
I only watched Na Mo Hyun.

839
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:13.960
Those who are heading...

840
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.590
to Busan...

841
00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:18.259
should get in the train now.

842
00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:26.299
Kang Pil Joo. Pil Joo!

843
00:59:26.469 --> 00:59:28.440
Pil Joo, wait.

844
00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.069
Pil Joo.

845
00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.750
Help me get married.

846
00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:44.489
With Na Mo Hyun.

847
01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.139
- Ms. Na. - Yes?

848
01:00:03.139 --> 01:00:06.170
Why do male birds have more beautiful and colorful feathers?

849
01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.480
In order to get caught by predators easily.

850
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.880
If they get caught, they'll be eaten by the predators.

851
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.310
That's right.

852
01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:15.250
Male birds lure predators with their colorful feathers,

853
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:18.190
so female birds can protect their eggs...

854
01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:20.219
even better.

855
01:00:21.219 --> 01:00:24.630
It's called "male birds' lure and sacrifice".

856
01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.940
- Look at that. - What was that?

857
01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.610
What should we do?

858
01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:44.750
Boo Cheol.

859
01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.610
Run.

860
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.179
What?

861
01:00:48.179 --> 01:00:49.279
Go save the bird.

862
01:00:51.819 --> 01:00:53.119
My goodness!

863
01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:55.219
- What should we do? - Oh, my gosh.

864
01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.230
What just happened?

865
01:02:00.119 --> 01:02:03.290
(Money Flower)
