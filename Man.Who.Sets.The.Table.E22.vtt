1
00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:09.026
You choose,

2
00:00:09.593 --> 00:00:12.496
Do you want to agree on it
or go through a trial?

3
00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:25.075
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.345
I'm talking about our divorce,

5
00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.348
Aren't you tired of it?

6
00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.651
I already know
why you are doing this,

7
00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:39.056
That's enough,
Stop embarrassing our family,

8
00:00:39.423 --> 00:00:40.891
The squeaky wheel gets the grease,

9
00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:45.162
I know that you wanted to go
on a honeymoon, Let's go,

10
00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:47.064
Let's go to Hainan, China,

11
00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:51.101
Let's go in the coffee bath and palm
bath that women like so much,

12
00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:56.073
You're really horrible,

13
00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:59.943
Why can't you understand
what your wife wants?

14
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.648
You're getting a divorce because
you don't know what she wants,

15
00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:06.750
You're not allowed to say
that just because you're a lawyer,

16
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.986
Even if this is your job,

17
00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:13.557
you can't interfere with someone
else's family business,

18
00:01:14.357 --> 00:01:15.926
This woman is my wife,

19
00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:17.928
and I'll be the one deciding
how I will divorce,

20
00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:20.497
I'm interfering because it isn't
someone else's family business,

21
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.365
I already clearly told you,

22
00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.234
Ms, Hong requested,,,

23
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.003
that I help her divorce,,,

24
00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:28.839
her awful husband,

25
00:01:28.972 --> 00:01:32.375
Really? Then listen carefully,

26
00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:33.844
I'll give you an answer,

27
00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.948
I, Lee Shin Mo, will never divorce,

28
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:40.884
Over my dead body,

29
00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:42.752
I'll eat my own hat,

30
00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:46.223
and just die,

31
00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:50.393
I will never divorce you,

32
00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.166
Look, Let's just go to court
as we originally planned to,

33
00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.503
What? Court?

34
00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:03.707
Do you think the judge will grant
you a divorce if we go to court?

35
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.010
Why would you divorce me?

36
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.546
I always gave you money,

37
00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.381
I never had an affair,
and I never hit you,

38
00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:14.551
You need a reason to divorce,

39
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:20.023
- Did you do what I told you to do?
- Yes,

40
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.460
Here it is,

41
00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.466
What is that?

42
00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.135
You're going to turn 60 soon,

43
00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:35.739
You stopped menstruating,
Who would consider you as a woman?

44
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:39.743
I'm still a man,

45
00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:43.046
You're just,,,

46
00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:46.683
a human, Androgynous,

47
00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:49.252
You're an old woman,

48
00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:52.355
You're so stupid,,,

49
00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:56.426
and whatever your daughter does
is also stupid,

50
00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:57.661
You should also kneel,

51
00:02:58.295 --> 00:02:59.429
Kneel,

52
00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:08.338
Did you record this?

53
00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.807
Secretly?

54
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.877
I knew this would happen,
so I made her do it,

55
00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.514
I made her record every time you
verbally accused her,

56
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:18.982
For evidence,

57
00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:20.717
You also know, don't you?

58
00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:23.954
It can be a rightful reason
to divorce,,,

59
00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:26.957
if one's spouse treats them wrongly,

60
00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:31.428
My head hurts,

61
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.733
My blood pressure is going up,

62
00:03:37.534 --> 00:03:41.071
So you two banded together,,,

63
00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:43.106
to betray me?

64
00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:46.009
Oh, my,

65
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.245
I want to end
this as soon as possible,

66
00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:50.614
Please register
a divorce settlement quickly,

67
00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:55.619
See you in court,

68
00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:03.393
Young Hye, stop,

69
00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:05.061
Stop,

70
00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:10.700
How could you talk so rudely
to your wife?

71
00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:13.703
That's why she's divorcing you,

72
00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:19.743
Did she really decide to get
a divorce?

73
00:04:19.776 --> 00:04:21.278
Is she serious?

74
00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:23.913
Does she really want a divorce?

75
00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.417
I'm telling you this
for the sake of our old friendship,

76
00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:31.021
It's been a while since Young Hye
decided this,

77
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.659
You have no other choice,
Just accept it,

78
00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:37.961
Even if you treated her bad,

79
00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:40.897
you can leave her decently,

80
00:04:43.133 --> 00:04:44.467
Let's talk later,

81
00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:49.906
(Episode 22)

82
00:04:51.308 --> 00:04:53.777
Young Hye,

83
00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:57.514
Ms, Hong, I have to tell
you something,

84
00:04:57.514 --> 00:04:59.482
Ms, Hong, wait a minute,

85
00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:01.918
Ms, Hong,

86
00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:04.054
You're hurting me,

87
00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.289
Ms, Hong, I'll go with you,

88
00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:11.428
What are you doing? Get off,

89
00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:13.563
I can't get off,
No, I won't get off,

90
00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:15.065
- Mister?
- Yes,

91
00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:18.601
- Let's go to Paju,
- No, let's go to Mok-dong,

92
00:05:18.702 --> 00:05:22.772
I'll pay you more,

93
00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:24.474
Please go to Paju no matter what,

94
00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:26.343
I was here first,

95
00:05:26.443 --> 00:05:27.777
Let's go to Mok-dong,

96
00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.513
I'll pay you double the fee,
Let's go to Paju,

97
00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:32.315
Double, Let's go to Paju,

98
00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:34.551
Decide quickly, Where will you go?

99
00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:36.653
- Go,,,
- Hold on,

100
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.054
I'll get off,

101
00:05:38.054 --> 00:05:41.124
No, don't get off,
You can't get off here,

102
00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:44.260
Sir, please take us to Paju, Hurry,

103
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.429
Why do you want to go to Paju?

104
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.430
I'm heading to Paju now,

105
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.266
Yes, yes, Please drive us to Paju,

106
00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.848
I'm sorry for everything,

107
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.718
I'm sorry I chose you
for what you have instead of love,,,

108
00:06:10.687 --> 00:06:12.956
and not having loved you
when we were together,

109
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:16.326
What a jerk,

110
00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:20.029
He didn't love me
at all to begin with,

111
00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:25.268
(4 years ago)

112
00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:39.382
I heard a lot about you
from your father,

113
00:06:39.382 --> 00:06:41.718
I didn't expect you'd be joining us,

114
00:06:42.018 --> 00:06:43.720
What a surprise,

115
00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:46.689
She's still a baby to me,

116
00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.925
and she's my only daughter,

117
00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:52.228
She's very precious to me,
I hope you understand,

118
00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:54.364
I see,

119
00:06:54.364 --> 00:06:56.599
You're very handsome,

120
00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.936
I like handsome guys, so when you
came in, I thought I would go blind,

121
00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:01.838
I think I even saw a halo
behind you,

122
00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:07.444
Yeon Ju,

123
00:07:07.444 --> 00:07:11.047
Keep your mouth shut,
Let me do the talking,

124
00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:15.385
If it's not too much trouble,
could you stand up,,,

125
00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:18.521
and turn for us?

126
00:07:21.057 --> 00:07:22.258
Mom,

127
00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:25.361
When you buy a bull, you need
to look at it thoroughly,

128
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.665
We need to be thorough
as he's going to be your husband,

129
00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:30.600
Stand up,

130
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.390
I became a widow at a young age,

131
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.327
Do you happen to know if any
of your family members suffered,,,

132
00:07:57.327 --> 00:07:59.996
from lung cancer, gastric cancer,

133
00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:01.931
breast cancer,

134
00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:05.301
or testicular cancer?
If you do, please let us know,

135
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:06.369
No, not to my knowledge,

136
00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:10.073
Okay, Please send me
your medical license,

137
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:13.376
your school transcript,

138
00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:15.378
and your physical exam result,,,

139
00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:18.147
to my email address,

140
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:22.218
I have questions of my own,
Let me ask them,

141
00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:24.454
- Sure,
- Of course,

142
00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:27.891
I heard you live in Cheongdam-dong,
How big is your house?

143
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:29.626
I'm aware you have properties
in Gangnam,

144
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:31.361
You didn't take out
mortgages on them, did you?

145
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:33.663
One more thing,
Your daughter's looks,

146
00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:35.565
Is it natural?

147
00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:37.166
Excuse me?

148
00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:40.303
Oh, my goodness,
I didn't have any plastic surgeries,

149
00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:44.307
I just had a little bit of help,

150
00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.544
Send me the certified copies
of your house and properties,,,

151
00:08:47.544 --> 00:08:49.712
and your daughter's
yearbook photos first,

152
00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:50.713
Yearbook photos?

153
00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:53.082
After I checked them,
I'll send you mine,

154
00:08:53.082 --> 00:08:54.183
What do we do?

155
00:08:56.219 --> 00:08:57.854
It was nice meeting you,

156
00:08:57.854 --> 00:09:00.790
Right, it seems you have
a lot of money,

157
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.825
so please pay for my coffee today,

158
00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:08.498
My goodness, Mr, Lee So Won,
Excuse me, Mr, Lee,

159
00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:09.866
Wait,

160
00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:12.302
Mom, do something,

161
00:09:15.772 --> 00:09:18.708
Oh, my, What a man,

162
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:21.644
He has strong self-respect,

163
00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:24.480
It's over, In a few days,

164
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.451
I'm going to give him a white sedan,

165
00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:30.520
Why would you do that?

166
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.156
He's going to be your husband,
He needs to at least,,,

167
00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:35.692
drive a car
with the capacity of 5,000cc,

168
00:09:37.093 --> 00:09:38.194
Really?

169
00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:45.635
Self-respect, my foot,

170
00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:47.537
He was really after our money,

171
00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:51.407
I lost myself after falling
in love at first sight,

172
00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:54.777
I must have lost my mind, Seriously,

173
00:09:54.777 --> 00:09:56.613
Stupid, stupid,

174
00:09:56.613 --> 00:09:57.880
Hey,

175
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.150
why are you hitting your head when
you were putting away the clothes?

176
00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:04.287
It'll only sound hollow
as it's empty,

177
00:10:04.287 --> 00:10:06.889
It's just because the more I think
about him, the angrier I get,

178
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:09.859
If you have the energy to get angry,
learn how money can make you happy,

179
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.729
Money can bring more excitement
and happiness than men,

180
00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:14.864
It's much better than men,

181
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.499
The flavor of money,

182
00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:19.268
The flavor of money?
What does that mean?

183
00:10:19.268 --> 00:10:21.037
It means you should get the taste
of money,

184
00:10:21.137 --> 00:10:23.873
When the problem
regarding THAAD is resolved,

185
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.775
I'm going to go to China,,,

186
00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:28.044
and start a rental business,

187
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:31.514
That's why I've been studying
Chinese at home these days,

188
00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:33.783
Have you eaten?

189
00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.185
I just asked if you ate today,

190
00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.154
Have you eaten?

191
00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:40.757
Good job,
but you need to be careful,

192
00:10:40.757 --> 00:10:43.626
If you pronounce
one of the syllables wrong,

193
00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:45.128
you'll be in trouble,

194
00:10:45.128 --> 00:10:46.929
Let's go eat lunch,

195
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.366
Welcome, Doctor,

196
00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:51.567
Hello,

197
00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:56.773
Where are we?

198
00:10:57.106 --> 00:10:58.808
This is the clinic I'm going to run,

199
00:10:59.475 --> 00:11:01.744
What about the other clinic?

200
00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:05.381
I quit working there,

201
00:11:05.615 --> 00:11:07.250
I'm going to start working here,

202
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.987
That clinic was nice,
Why did you quit?

203
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.289
You're only a kid, but you're
full of questions, aren't you?

204
00:11:14.791 --> 00:11:17.293
Sir, make the hallways wider,,,

205
00:11:17.293 --> 00:11:19.095
and get rid of the thresholds,

206
00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.363
Don't worry,

207
00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:22.665
Please be thorough
regarding the plumbing,,,

208
00:11:22.665 --> 00:11:25.134
and the air duct
in the radiation rooms,

209
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.471
What is it?

210
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:32.408
I'm hungry, I don't want
jjajangmyeon, I want rice,

211
00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.546
Is there a good restaurant
near here?

212
00:11:43.986 --> 00:11:45.955
How is it, Mom? Do you like it?

213
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:49.125
This is the best restaurant
in the area, Isn't it good?

214
00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.729
This is tasty, It's wonderful,

215
00:11:52.729 --> 00:11:56.599
Don't eat this kimchi,
It's too spicy for you,

216
00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:59.168
Is it? Thank you
for letting me know,

217
00:12:01.204 --> 00:12:03.906
Ma'am, all of our tables are taken,
Do you mind sharing the space?

218
00:12:03.906 --> 00:12:05.608
No, we don't,
There's an empty table there,

219
00:12:05.608 --> 00:12:07.543
You should sell
as much food as you can,

220
00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:10.279
Tell them to come in, Sure,

221
00:12:10.613 --> 00:12:11.681
Here,

222
00:12:21.624 --> 00:12:25.027
Darn it, Enemies encounter
at the worst time and place,

223
00:12:25.027 --> 00:12:26.763
Why are you here?

224
00:12:26.763 --> 00:12:28.631
Are you stalking Yeon Ju?

225
00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:31.267
Watch your tongue, ma'am,

226
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.802
I came here to eat,

227
00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.304
Han Gyul, let's go
somewhere else and eat,

228
00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:37.673
No, I'm hungry,

229
00:12:47.617 --> 00:12:49.719
Han Gyul, let's go
to another restaurant,

230
00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:53.256
No, no! I'm hungry, Can't you see?

231
00:12:53.256 --> 00:12:55.191
Here's your meal,

232
00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:59.028
As long as you're not here for me,
just have your meal and go,

233
00:12:59.095 --> 00:13:01.497
I don't have a single ounce
of lingering feelings left for you,

234
00:13:01.497 --> 00:13:02.899
Neither do I,

235
00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.268
Then I'll enjoy my meal,

236
00:13:09.605 --> 00:13:12.041
All right, my daughter, Let's eat,

237
00:13:16.112 --> 00:13:18.881
Yeon Ju, do you know
the movie director who filmed,,,

238
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:21.384
"Bus Driver" with the 10 million
audience mark?

239
00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:23.219
He's a close friend of mine,

240
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:26.622
I'll set the date, You should
go and meet Director Joo,

241
00:13:26.656 --> 00:13:29.392
- Why?
- Do you have to ask?

242
00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.627
When Ms, Park from Samcheong-dong,,,

243
00:13:31.627 --> 00:13:33.796
heard that you got a divorce,

244
00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:38.000
she got good-looking doctors
lined up for you,

245
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.770
You ought to take photos
and give them out,

246
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.240
Is that so? How nice,

247
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.377
Mom, but this time, we need to do
check their past more thoroughly,

248
00:13:48.377 --> 00:13:50.646
Please find me a husband
without a kid this time,

249
00:13:50.646 --> 00:13:51.881
Sure,

250
00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:55.618
Han Gyul, do you know
who the most pathetic person is?

251
00:13:55.618 --> 00:13:57.019
What is it?

252
00:13:57.854 --> 00:13:59.722
Someone who's
photoshopping photos,,,

253
00:13:59.722 --> 00:14:02.291
because she has gone mad to remarry,

254
00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:04.827
Don't ever grow up like that, okay?

255
00:14:06.729 --> 00:14:08.898
Just like Yeon Ju?

256
00:14:09.365 --> 00:14:12.168
Yeon Ju? Who is that?

257
00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:16.038
Right, The woman whom I spent
time with for a while,

258
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.940
She's no better than dust,

259
00:14:19.642 --> 00:14:22.311
You jerk, Dust?

260
00:14:22.378 --> 00:14:24.780
You'd better watch your tongue,
How dare you run your mouth?

261
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.917
We lived under the same roof
for four years,

262
00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:30.586
Are you trying to cause a fight,
you scumbag?

263
00:14:30.586 --> 00:14:34.123
I won't swear at you anymore
for the sake of your daughter,

264
00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:37.393
You need to watch your mouth,
It was you who started,,,

265
00:14:40.863 --> 00:14:42.164
What is it?

266
00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:44.767
What happened?

267
00:14:45.167 --> 00:14:46.836
What's wrong with her?

268
00:14:47.536 --> 00:14:50.506
She must have eaten
the spicy kimchi,

269
00:14:50.506 --> 00:14:52.008
Are you crying
because it's spicy, Han Gyul?

270
00:14:52.008 --> 00:14:53.175
Yes,

271
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:56.379
Drink some water now,

272
00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.715
Water won't cut it,

273
00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:01.751
She needs milk to ease the pain,

274
00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:06.022
Stay here, I'll get you some milk,

275
00:15:08.124 --> 00:15:10.760
It's so spicy,

276
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.495
Han Gyul, are you all right?

277
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.330
It's spicy, isn't it?

278
00:15:14.764 --> 00:15:17.767
Eat some cucumber,

279
00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:19.368
Try this,

280
00:15:23.506 --> 00:15:24.573
Oh, my,

281
00:15:25.408 --> 00:15:26.542
My goodness,

282
00:15:32.915 --> 00:15:36.285
She's throwing a fit, My goodness,

283
00:15:42.792 --> 00:15:44.193
Come here, Let's wash your face,

284
00:15:49.532 --> 00:15:51.534
What kind of strange fate is this?

285
00:15:51.634 --> 00:15:53.569
Why do we keep meeting
in the bathroom?

286
00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:55.805
Are you mad?

287
00:15:57.606 --> 00:15:58.674
No, I'm not,

288
00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:01.143
Is it still spicy?

289
00:16:09.986 --> 00:16:11.153
Where's Han Gyul?

290
00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:15.524
Your daughter and my daughter are
incompatible,

291
00:16:15.758 --> 00:16:19.762
Your daughter vomited on
Yeon Ju's new clothes,

292
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:21.831
I'm sorry,

293
00:16:25.234 --> 00:16:29.772
Why did you decide to raise her when
you can't even care for her well?

294
00:16:29.772 --> 00:16:31.374
You're just suffering,

295
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:35.911
Anyway, thank you for last time,

296
00:16:37.146 --> 00:16:38.647
I didn't have the chance
to thank you,

297
00:16:39.482 --> 00:16:42.051
Thank you for stopping Yeon Ju
from going through a hard time,

298
00:16:43.452 --> 00:16:44.653
How is,,,

299
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:47.156
Yeon Ju doing these days?

300
00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:48.924
What use is there talking about it?

301
00:16:49.025 --> 00:16:51.761
She loved you so much,

302
00:16:51.894 --> 00:16:54.330
Her betrayal is probably as
great as her love is,

303
00:16:55.498 --> 00:16:56.665
I'm sorry,

304
00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:58.534
If you're serious,

305
00:16:58.734 --> 00:17:00.403
continue talking rudely,,,

306
00:17:00.403 --> 00:17:02.772
to her to make her stop
loving you,

307
00:17:02.838 --> 00:17:04.907
She'll get disappointed by you,

308
00:17:18.754 --> 00:17:20.356
I'm sorry,

309
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:32.301
Don't eat anything spicy
from now on, Do you understand?

310
00:17:32.902 --> 00:17:35.004
You almost ruined
my expensive clothes,

311
00:17:40.443 --> 00:17:42.845
Is your dad doing okay these days?

312
00:17:42.912 --> 00:17:45.314
What do you mean by doing okay?

313
00:17:46.015 --> 00:17:47.783
Is he eating well?

314
00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.853
He says that he doesn't have
an appetite,

315
00:17:52.054 --> 00:17:53.689
He must sleep well,

316
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.125
He says that he can't sleep,

317
00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:00.996
Why is he acting so pitiful
when he wanted to divorce?

318
00:18:10.973 --> 00:18:13.809
Drop us off right there,

319
00:18:22.451 --> 00:18:23.586
Get off,

320
00:18:28.424 --> 00:18:29.558
Mister,

321
00:18:30.259 --> 00:18:31.494
Goodness, this woman,

322
00:18:31.494 --> 00:18:33.395
Please take me back to Seoul,
Quickly,

323
00:18:33.662 --> 00:18:36.966
- Get off, Quickly,
- Oh, my,

324
00:18:37.933 --> 00:18:40.202
Go back to Seoul, Go,

325
00:18:40.903 --> 00:18:43.005
Why did you bring me here?

326
00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:45.274
- Let's go,
- Where?

327
00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:48.377
Are you really asking because
you don't know?

328
00:18:49.311 --> 00:18:52.314
You're crazy, Do you think I won't
divorce you because of this?

329
00:18:56.085 --> 00:18:57.553
- Let's go,
- Let go of me,

330
00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.655
- Come,
- Let me go,

331
00:18:59.755 --> 00:19:01.190
- Follow me,
- It hurts,

332
00:19:15.337 --> 00:19:16.539
Bow,

333
00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.377
Tell me what you want to say,

334
00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.613
Why did you bring
me to my father's grave?

335
00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:26.115
Do you really not know?

336
00:19:26.649 --> 00:19:30.119
You're a bad daughter
that could never be forgiven,

337
00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:32.588
You married
me after all that opposition,

338
00:19:32.655 --> 00:19:35.191
Instead of living a happy life,
you want to divorce me,

339
00:19:36.959 --> 00:19:40.396
If you want to divorce me, get
permission from your father first,

340
00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:43.199
I'll do as you want to do
after that,

341
00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:46.302
He already passed away,
How will he give me permission?

342
00:19:46.335 --> 00:19:49.238
Lay your hand on your heart,
and ask him honestly,

343
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:52.408
If he says, "Yes, my daughter,"

344
00:19:52.408 --> 00:19:55.678
"you only live once,
Do whatever you want to,"

345
00:19:55.744 --> 00:19:57.146
"A divorce isn't a big deal,"

346
00:19:57.213 --> 00:19:59.014
"It's something to celebrate,"

347
00:19:59.248 --> 00:20:01.984
Then I'll divorce you,

348
00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:06.689
Okay, I'll ask for his answer,

349
00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:15.397
(The grave of
the late Hong Jin Soo)

350
00:20:15.397 --> 00:20:17.733
(Are you here? Thank you!
Are you doing good? From Father,)

351
00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:28.944
(Are you here? Thank you!
Are you doing good? From Father,)

352
00:20:37.086 --> 00:20:38.254
Father,

353
00:20:41.223 --> 00:20:43.025
I will take Young Hye with me,

354
00:20:43.225 --> 00:20:44.326
Let's go,

355
00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.095
What are you doing?

356
00:20:46.095 --> 00:20:48.530
How will you support her?

357
00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:50.699
The day that I die,,,

358
00:20:50.699 --> 00:20:54.303
will be the day my daughter marries
a clown like you,

359
00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:55.638
Okay,

360
00:21:13.022 --> 00:21:16.792
I'll get a job and support her,

361
00:21:17.293 --> 00:21:19.295
- Let's go,
- Where are you going?

362
00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:20.929
Sit down,

363
00:21:31.507 --> 00:21:32.574
Do you regret this?

364
00:21:32.574 --> 00:21:34.009
If you're with me,

365
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:36.645
I'll never regret this,

366
00:21:39.648 --> 00:21:41.517
I can't promise you anything else,

367
00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:44.053
I can only promise you one thing,

368
00:21:44.753 --> 00:21:46.555
I'll never make you cry,

369
00:22:00.469 --> 00:22:03.505
You feel sorry to your father,
right?

370
00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:09.278
I have mixed feelings from
being here,

371
00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:14.316
I was living under a big delusion
until now,

372
00:22:15.517 --> 00:22:19.221
I thought you were nagging me
whenever you said,,,

373
00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:21.390
you wanted a divorce,

374
00:22:22.658 --> 00:22:27.096
But now I know that you're serious,

375
00:22:27.996 --> 00:22:29.331
I'll try to change,

376
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.953
Don't you know how smart I am?

377
00:22:51.019 --> 00:22:55.090
I didn't know what I was doing
wrong, but now I know,

378
00:22:56.091 --> 00:22:57.826
I'll be good to your sister,

379
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:00.863
I'll also speak nicely to you,

380
00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:03.065
I'll treat you respectfully,

381
00:23:04.833 --> 00:23:08.036
Let's also slowly divide
our finances,

382
00:23:11.707 --> 00:23:12.975
My goodness,

383
00:23:13.842 --> 00:23:16.345
Think about it,

384
00:23:16.712 --> 00:23:19.615
So Won just got a divorce, What
would happen if we also divorced?

385
00:23:20.082 --> 00:23:21.483
What would people say?

386
00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:24.286
We will be the talk of the town,

387
00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:26.455
Ru Ri won't be able to get married,

388
00:23:26.522 --> 00:23:27.956
So Won won't be able
to get remarried,

389
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.293
Han Gyul will die as an old maid,

390
00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.930
I'm going to move out tomorrow,
See you in court,

391
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.733
Young Hye,

392
00:23:37.733 --> 00:23:39.802
It's my fault,

393
00:23:39.802 --> 00:23:43.372
Just give me one more chance,

394
00:23:43.372 --> 00:23:44.573
Young Hye,

395
00:23:44.606 --> 00:23:47.543
I will really change,
I will fix my ways,

396
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:50.078
You can never change,

397
00:23:50.612 --> 00:23:53.248
Please let me live decently,

398
00:23:53.649 --> 00:23:56.585
No, I don't want to,

399
00:23:56.585 --> 00:23:58.053
I'll change,

400
00:23:58.487 --> 00:24:01.223
Just give me six months,

401
00:24:01.256 --> 00:24:03.826
If you're not satisfied then,

402
00:24:03.992 --> 00:24:05.761
let's get a divorce after that,

403
00:24:05.761 --> 00:24:06.995
Young Hye,

404
00:24:07.596 --> 00:24:08.764
That's enough,

405
00:24:08.764 --> 00:24:11.533
What about three months?

406
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:15.604
No, just give me one month,

407
00:24:16.572 --> 00:24:21.043
I really want to become the husband
that you want,

408
00:24:21.977 --> 00:24:24.746
- I'll become that person,
- That's enough,

409
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.783
Hold on, Young Hye,

410
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:31.753
We can get a divorce any time,

411
00:24:31.753 --> 00:24:33.956
But once a family is broken,
it's over,

412
00:24:33.956 --> 00:24:36.525
Nothing will change if we divorce
one month later,

413
00:24:36.592 --> 00:24:38.293
I'm begging you,

414
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.662
Give me one more chance,

415
00:24:40.662 --> 00:24:43.065
Young Hye, please,

416
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:49.037
Do you want me to kneel?
Will that satisfy you?

417
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.139
- Should I kneel?
- Stop,

418
00:24:51.773 --> 00:24:53.275
Your knees didn't do anything wrong,

419
00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:55.110
It's cold, Let's go,

420
00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.883
Young Hye, you agreed, right?

421
00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.021
Father,

422
00:25:06.522 --> 00:25:08.524
I'm really sorry,

423
00:25:09.391 --> 00:25:12.628
Young Hye, I trust you,

424
00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:15.030
You agreed, right?

425
00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:18.033
I love you

426
00:25:18.033 --> 00:25:20.168
I love you,

427
00:25:20.168 --> 00:25:21.703
Young Hye, I love you,

428
00:25:23.472 --> 00:25:25.007
I love you,

429
00:25:25.073 --> 00:25:26.575
Young Hye, I love you,

430
00:25:28.744 --> 00:25:30.846
10 servings of pork neck,

431
00:25:32.281 --> 00:25:34.316
10 servings of onions,

432
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.251
Garlic,,, My goodness,

433
00:25:36.251 --> 00:25:38.053
I can't concentrate,

434
00:25:38.854 --> 00:25:40.355
Did you get a cold?

435
00:25:40.556 --> 00:25:41.690
Yes,

436
00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:44.693
The boiler broke at my house,

437
00:25:44.693 --> 00:25:48.230
Oh, my, You should have told me,

438
00:25:48.263 --> 00:25:50.432
You can sleep at my house,

439
00:25:50.432 --> 00:25:52.234
No,

440
00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:55.404
I'm still a man,

441
00:25:55.404 --> 00:25:58.173
I know, That's why,

442
00:25:58.173 --> 00:25:59.274
What?

443
00:25:59.575 --> 00:26:02.277
You didn't get the boiler fixed yet,
right?

444
00:26:02.744 --> 00:26:03.845
No,

445
00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:07.549
Tonight,

446
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.052
- come to my house to eat ramyeon,
- What?

447
00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:13.455
I'll warm the house
and wait for you,

448
00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:20.228
I'm a regular employee now!

449
00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:24.099
Hey!

450
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:27.436
Goodness, Stop it,

451
00:26:27.536 --> 00:26:30.339
He won't survive
if you keep doing that,

452
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.474
Did it show that much?

453
00:26:32.474 --> 00:26:33.842
A lot,

454
00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:35.310
A lot?

455
00:26:35.644 --> 00:26:37.312
You know there's
a security camera here, right?

456
00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:38.380
Oh, gosh,

457
00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:49.691
She might have tried
to kill him once,

458
00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:51.827
but she could change her mind,,,

459
00:26:51.827 --> 00:26:53.328
after realizing that he is rich,

460
00:27:02.537 --> 00:27:05.474
Dad, Your mother is here again,

461
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.184
How have you been?

462
00:27:16.184 --> 00:27:17.519
Why are you here?

463
00:27:17.586 --> 00:27:19.254
Could you step outside for a moment?

464
00:27:19.254 --> 00:27:21.490
I need to talk to your father,

465
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.191
Be quick,

466
00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:26.028
I really don't like
having you at our house,

467
00:27:33.468 --> 00:27:36.538
You said you were raising them well,
Look how rude she is,

468
00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:38.373
What is it this time?

469
00:27:38.707 --> 00:27:40.275
I don't think there's
anything else you can tell me,

470
00:27:40.275 --> 00:27:41.843
Don't you know why I'm here?

471
00:27:41.943 --> 00:27:45.213
If you do nothing,
Kevin will win over Jung Hwa Young,

472
00:27:45.213 --> 00:27:47.349
- Hey!
- Get rid of Jung Tae Yang,,,

473
00:27:47.582 --> 00:27:49.117
before Kevin finds out,

474
00:27:50.252 --> 00:27:53.055
Are you not doing anything because
you don't know how to do that?

475
00:27:55.023 --> 00:27:58.360
This is the record of her crimes
in America,

476
00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:02.964
Tell Jung Tae Yang
about what she did there,

477
00:28:03.532 --> 00:28:06.768
Tell him that someone is threatening
that if he doesn't quit,

478
00:28:06.768 --> 00:28:08.737
this will be disclosed to the world,

479
00:28:09.237 --> 00:28:12.207
He's very fond of his mom,
He'll quit the company,

480
00:28:12.207 --> 00:28:13.709
I can't believe you're doing this!

481
00:28:13.709 --> 00:28:15.811
If you can't do this, I will!

482
00:28:17.012 --> 00:28:18.346
Do you want that?

483
00:28:20.382 --> 00:28:22.084
Listen to me carefully,

484
00:28:22.517 --> 00:28:26.388
If you threaten Tae Yang
with this,

485
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:28.857
you won't survive either,

486
00:28:30.092 --> 00:28:33.061
I will go meet the chairman,,,

487
00:28:33.061 --> 00:28:36.798
and tell him how you've been
bothering Tae Yang and Hwa Young,

488
00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:38.366
I'll tell him everything,

489
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.302
If that happens,

490
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:42.838
what do you think the chairman,
who is looking for his son,

491
00:28:43.572 --> 00:28:44.873
will do?

492
00:28:46.341 --> 00:28:48.510
If you don't want to get hurt too,

493
00:28:49.177 --> 00:28:51.546
step out of this, and stay quiet,

494
00:28:51.747 --> 00:28:52.848
Do you understand?

495
00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:59.354
I don't have anything else
to discuss with you, Leave,

496
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.326
Leave right now! Go!

497
00:29:05.894 --> 00:29:07.095
Let me go,

498
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.067
You look so much better,

499
00:29:12.067 --> 00:29:15.470
You must have heard about the
rich ex-husband from your sister,

500
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.241
Get out now!

501
00:29:23.945 --> 00:29:26.982
You shouldn't be too happy yet,

502
00:29:27.783 --> 00:29:31.386
I'm going to make sure
you don't become happy,

503
00:29:32.354 --> 00:29:33.655
Do you understand?

504
00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:45.033
I can't believe
your mother is acting like this,

505
00:29:46.501 --> 00:29:49.304
Stop it, The children are listening,

506
00:30:00.949 --> 00:30:02.751
Where is my son?

507
00:30:03.852 --> 00:30:05.053
I'm sorry,

508
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.023
While we were searching,
Go Jung Do found out,

509
00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:09.791
He got the photos,

510
00:30:09.791 --> 00:30:12.761
So you checked
that he's living with them, right?

511
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:15.363
I heard that a tall young man
lives with them,

512
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.765
How can this be?

513
00:30:17.265 --> 00:30:19.501
I know that my son exists,

514
00:30:19.501 --> 00:30:21.269
but I don't know what he looks like,

515
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:24.105
what his name is, nor how he lives,

516
00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:25.273
I'm sorry,

517
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:31.213
Shall we bust into that house today?

518
00:30:31.213 --> 00:30:32.247
Sir,

519
00:30:32.514 --> 00:30:34.115
I know, I know,

520
00:30:34.316 --> 00:30:36.451
That will end everything,

521
00:30:36.651 --> 00:30:38.320
Just wait a little bit longer,

522
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.356
We're trying to find out again,
We'll get the results soon,

523
00:30:51.766 --> 00:30:53.201
Do you like it?

524
00:30:53.201 --> 00:30:54.636
Of course,

525
00:30:54.803 --> 00:30:58.273
This is the first ring
that I've received in my life,

526
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.276
It's my first time
giving a ring to a woman too,

527
00:31:02.077 --> 00:31:03.245
Really?

528
00:31:03.245 --> 00:31:07.115
I told you, I never thought
about getting married,

529
00:31:10.485 --> 00:31:13.455
So that means I changed you, right?

530
00:31:14.189 --> 00:31:16.758
I changed a lot thanks to you,

531
00:31:17.092 --> 00:31:19.160
I became a regular employee,

532
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.829
and my skills improved,

533
00:31:21.196 --> 00:31:23.231
I became confident too,

534
00:31:23.498 --> 00:31:24.866
Someone told me,,,

535
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.070
that people who are meant to be
change each other in a good way,

536
00:31:31.239 --> 00:31:34.376
Please take good care me,

537
00:31:36.811 --> 00:31:39.814
Whatever happens from now on,
whatever people say,

538
00:31:40.448 --> 00:31:41.983
let's trust each other,

539
00:31:44.052 --> 00:31:45.854
I learned this from my mom,

540
00:31:45.854 --> 00:31:49.758
My mom told me to be
honest with my emotions in life,

541
00:31:50.492 --> 00:31:54.429
So from now on,
I will trust myself,,,

542
00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:55.997
whatever other people say,

543
00:31:56.531 --> 00:31:58.867
I will trust my heart
that trusts you,

544
00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:04.039
By the way,

545
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.876
are your parents
really getting divorced?

546
00:32:09.077 --> 00:32:10.679
I'm upset,

547
00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:15.684
but I think
this is the best for my mom,

548
00:32:17.485 --> 00:32:20.255
But it does feel strange to think,,,

549
00:32:20.255 --> 00:32:23.291
that I'll be living away
from my parents,,,

550
00:32:23.892 --> 00:32:25.727
for the first time in my life,

551
00:32:30.899 --> 00:32:32.567
If you're having a hard time,
you can lean on me,

552
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:34.936
I have more experience than you
on that,

553
00:32:36.571 --> 00:32:40.508
I can understand you a little now,

554
00:32:41.142 --> 00:32:43.078
I'm having a hard time now,

555
00:32:43.545 --> 00:32:47.615
How did you live your whole life
without knowing who your father is?

556
00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:51.820
I feel so sorry,

557
00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.555
Sometimes, it's a good thing,

558
00:32:54.022 --> 00:32:57.125
I can imagine him as someone great
in my head,

559
00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:01.262
In the past, I used to imagine
that the police officer next door,,,

560
00:33:01.262 --> 00:33:02.797
was my father,

561
00:33:04.032 --> 00:33:06.334
But now, my role model has changed,

562
00:33:07.268 --> 00:33:08.303
Who is it now?

563
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.338
You don't need to know,

564
00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:12.273
Can I guess?

565
00:33:12.607 --> 00:33:15.043
Is it,,,Chairman Kevin?

566
00:33:15.643 --> 00:33:17.545
Can you read my mind?

567
00:33:21.516 --> 00:33:23.284
What would you do,,,

568
00:33:23.752 --> 00:33:26.354
if your real father appeared,,,

569
00:33:26.554 --> 00:33:28.123
all of a sudden?

570
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.425
Will you meet him?

571
00:33:30.425 --> 00:33:32.460
I'm curious to find out who he is,

572
00:33:32.861 --> 00:33:35.296
but Mom doesn't want me to,
So it won't happen,

573
00:33:37.132 --> 00:33:38.533
Let's stop talking about this,

574
00:33:39.401 --> 00:33:41.336
He didn't look for me for 30 years,

575
00:33:41.469 --> 00:33:44.239
He won't look for me now,

576
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:03.858
Who is it at this hour?

577
00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:08.196
Are they here?

578
00:34:12.967 --> 00:34:14.769
It's past morning,
Why are you still here?

579
00:34:14.769 --> 00:34:17.372
I told you that I quit!
Why did you come here?

580
00:34:17.372 --> 00:34:20.575
Even if you quit,
you need to take the adequate steps,

581
00:34:21.276 --> 00:34:22.944
What steps?

582
00:34:23.545 --> 00:34:26.681
By now, Dad will be angry,
and he would want to fire me,

583
00:34:26.681 --> 00:34:28.116
He doesn't know,

584
00:34:28.416 --> 00:34:30.485
Tae Yang covered it up,

585
00:34:31.186 --> 00:34:32.454
Really?

586
00:34:34.522 --> 00:34:36.424
He's so funny,

587
00:34:37.225 --> 00:34:40.762
He doesn't have anything,
yet he pretends to be so cool,

588
00:34:41.396 --> 00:34:42.931
That's why I fell for him,

589
00:34:42.931 --> 00:34:44.365
He's a good person,

590
00:34:44.732 --> 00:34:47.202
So go to work tomorrow,

591
00:34:47.202 --> 00:34:48.837
and start over,

592
00:34:48.837 --> 00:34:51.673
Everyone in the office knows,
It's humiliating, How can I go?

593
00:34:52.207 --> 00:34:55.510
I will just go back to the old days
and live off Dad's money,

594
00:34:57.312 --> 00:34:58.446
Ma'am,

595
00:35:00.081 --> 00:35:01.716
This is your last chance,

596
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.952
The chairman is looking for his son,

597
00:35:04.452 --> 00:35:08.022
If you act up like this,
you'll lose his favor,

598
00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:09.424
Do you want that to happen?

599
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:11.226
Do you mean to say,,,

600
00:35:12.127 --> 00:35:14.462
that he really has a son?

601
00:35:14.462 --> 00:35:16.064
So please come to your senses,,,

602
00:35:16.064 --> 00:35:17.966
for your mom's sake,

603
00:35:19.167 --> 00:35:20.802
See you at the company tomorrow,

604
00:35:29.511 --> 00:35:30.812
It's on the third floor, right?

605
00:35:30.812 --> 00:35:32.547
Yes, it's room 308,

606
00:35:34.182 --> 00:35:36.084
Are you sure you can ask her?

607
00:35:36.151 --> 00:35:37.685
Of course,

608
00:35:37.685 --> 00:35:39.888
I can't take it anymore,

609
00:35:39.954 --> 00:35:42.557
You heard what the witch said,

610
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.193
Mom's rich ex-husband showed up,

611
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.762
And that man is the handsome guy
we saw?

612
00:35:48.663 --> 00:35:51.466
I'm going to find him and warn him,

613
00:35:51.666 --> 00:35:53.468
Not to get close to our mom,

614
00:36:10.952 --> 00:36:12.887
They look like Hwa Young's children,

615
00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:14.923
What are they doing here?

616
00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:18.826
What are you doing here?

617
00:36:18.893 --> 00:36:21.596
I heard you couldn't go to work
because you're sick, Are you okay?

618
00:36:22.163 --> 00:36:23.531
She looks fine,

619
00:36:23.831 --> 00:36:26.201
I'm tired,
Just say what you have to say,

620
00:36:26.501 --> 00:36:27.835
What do you want?

621
00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:30.872
Do you work at SC Food and Beverage
with my brother?

622
00:36:31.372 --> 00:36:32.507
Of course,

623
00:36:33.274 --> 00:36:36.077
Then you must know people
who work there,

624
00:36:36.144 --> 00:36:37.312
Why do you ask?

625
00:36:37.312 --> 00:36:40.548
We're looking for someone,
I thought you'd know,

626
00:36:41.049 --> 00:36:42.984
You're wasting your time,

627
00:36:43.251 --> 00:36:45.687
Why don't you ask your brother?

628
00:36:45.687 --> 00:36:47.956
It's because he can't know,

629
00:36:48.223 --> 00:36:50.258
Are you going to tell me or what?

630
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.527
You're quite the rude kid,
aren't you?

631
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:55.663
Tell me, Who is it?

632
00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:57.098
Show her,

633
00:37:09.277 --> 00:37:10.545
What is it?

634
00:37:10.545 --> 00:37:12.413
I just want to ask you something,

635
00:37:12.814 --> 00:37:15.216
Why are there
so many curious people today?

636
00:37:15.416 --> 00:37:17.952
Do you have guests right now?

637
00:37:17.952 --> 00:37:21.122
How did you know?
Children are at my house,

638
00:37:21.122 --> 00:37:24.492
Are they Chef Go Jung Do's children?

639
00:37:25.226 --> 00:37:27.762
Right, What about it?

640
00:37:28.396 --> 00:37:30.665
How do you know them?

641
00:37:30.665 --> 00:37:34.135
Jung Tae Young introduced me to
Chef Go Jung Do for cooking lessons,

642
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:38.906
Then how does Jung Tae Yang
know Go Jung Do?

643
00:37:39.774 --> 00:37:42.744
What do you mean?
That's his stepfather,

644
00:37:44.779 --> 00:37:46.814
What?

645
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:49.984
Is that true?

646
00:37:50.418 --> 00:37:51.886
I'm busy, Bye,

647
00:37:59.394 --> 00:38:02.363
Jung Tae Yang, I like him,

648
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.066
He looks familiar for some reason,

649
00:38:05.066 --> 00:38:08.002
He reminds me of myself
20 years ago,

650
00:38:08.002 --> 00:38:10.938
That reminds me his eyes
look like yours,

651
00:38:10.938 --> 00:38:12.073
Really?

652
00:38:17.412 --> 00:38:20.548
No way, He was so close,

653
00:38:21.849 --> 00:38:24.085
Who are you looking for?

654
00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:25.620
This man,

655
00:38:34.028 --> 00:38:35.463
It's an old picture,

656
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.665
He's a lot older now,

657
00:38:37.665 --> 00:38:38.966
but I've seen him at your company,

658
00:38:39.834 --> 00:38:42.136
He's decent and handsome,

659
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:45.973
Where did you find this picture?

660
00:38:46.107 --> 00:38:47.542
My mom kept it,

661
00:38:47.542 --> 00:38:49.744
- Inside her necklace,
- Who is that man?

662
00:38:50.144 --> 00:38:51.813
Is he in high position at work?

663
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:55.116
I'm not sure,

664
00:38:55.683 --> 00:38:57.719
I can't tell,
The picture's too small,

665
00:38:59.721 --> 00:39:03.891
Why did your mom have this picture?

666
00:39:05.126 --> 00:39:07.161
If she kept it so preciously,

667
00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:09.330
she must know him well,

668
00:39:10.932 --> 00:39:13.434
Why would you ask?
You said you don't know him,

669
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:16.404
- Let's go,
- Okay,

670
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:17.705
Bye,

671
00:39:24.912 --> 00:39:27.348
I'm sure that's Dad
when he was young,

672
00:39:27.915 --> 00:39:30.084
Why did their mom have that picture?

673
00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:33.554
Chairman's looking for his son,

674
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.894
Is their mom Dad's ex-wife?

675
00:39:41.496 --> 00:39:43.598
Then the son Dad's looking for is,,,

676
00:39:46.501 --> 00:39:48.736
No, No way,

677
00:40:04.952 --> 00:40:06.721
What are you drawing, Han Gyul?

678
00:40:07.121 --> 00:40:08.756
Yeon Ju,

679
00:40:09.891 --> 00:40:11.325
Why is she crying?

680
00:40:11.459 --> 00:40:14.529
She cried in the restroom,

681
00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:18.266
She cried?

682
00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:22.603
Yes, She asked if you're doing okay,

683
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:26.340
And she asked if you eat well,

684
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.943
and sleep well,

685
00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.580
She cried because I said no,

686
00:40:35.316 --> 00:40:39.487
Does she cry if you're not well?

687
00:40:43.024 --> 00:40:44.659
Let's promise one thing,

688
00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:49.163
You won't see her again, so let's
not talk about it, okay?

689
00:40:49.764 --> 00:40:51.098
Can you promise?

690
00:40:52.099 --> 00:40:54.035
Yes, Promise,

691
00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:12.119
Mom, He looked pitiful today,

692
00:41:12.253 --> 00:41:15.056
Who? Your ex-husband?

693
00:41:15.122 --> 00:41:16.257
Yes,

694
00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:18.226
He lost so much weight,

695
00:41:18.226 --> 00:41:20.528
His clothes were dirty,
and he looked poor,

696
00:41:21.162 --> 00:41:24.332
He's so picky that he never wears
pants that aren't ironed perfectly,

697
00:41:24.332 --> 00:41:26.334
but his pants weren't ironed,

698
00:41:26.334 --> 00:41:30.004
Right, His butts were
so wide and flat,

699
00:41:30.004 --> 00:41:32.340
It looked like he pooped
in his pants,

700
00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.408
He was so picky with food too,

701
00:41:34.842 --> 00:41:37.345
He hated mixing rice in soup,

702
00:41:37.645 --> 00:41:39.046
He must be poor,

703
00:41:39.046 --> 00:41:41.582
He went all the way
to eat that cheap gukbap,

704
00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:44.452
That's what I'm talking about,

705
00:41:44.452 --> 00:41:46.954
Why didn't they just take alimony
when they have nothing?

706
00:41:47.021 --> 00:41:49.624
500,000 is enough
to eat steak,,,

707
00:41:49.624 --> 00:41:51.526
after opening new hospital,

708
00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:54.195
Mom, What are you talking about?

709
00:41:54.629 --> 00:41:56.531
He didn't take alimony?

710
00:41:56.831 --> 00:42:00.001
You said he took it because
he only cares about money,

711
00:42:00.001 --> 00:42:02.436
That doesn't matter now,

712
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:04.372
You're already divorced,

713
00:42:04.372 --> 00:42:06.741
It's not important whether
he took the money or not,

714
00:42:06.841 --> 00:42:08.676
Because that doesn't make sense,

715
00:42:08.743 --> 00:42:11.612
He's so poor he can barely
make a living,

716
00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:12.747
Why didn't he take the money?

717
00:42:12.747 --> 00:42:14.382
Don't get it wrong,

718
00:42:14.382 --> 00:42:16.183
It's not for you,

719
00:42:16.183 --> 00:42:19.453
An old eagle is better
than a young crow,

720
00:42:19.453 --> 00:42:21.355
Pride, Show off,

721
00:42:21.355 --> 00:42:23.491
He was only showing off,

722
00:42:23.624 --> 00:42:24.992
Whatever,

723
00:42:24.992 --> 00:42:27.929
Why would I run into him there
in this wide Seoul?

724
00:42:28.162 --> 00:42:29.830
I'm worried now,

725
00:42:30.298 --> 00:42:32.867
Don't worry,

726
00:42:33.067 --> 00:42:35.469
I knew you were going to be worried,

727
00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:38.205
so I came up with a plan,

728
00:42:38.272 --> 00:42:39.574
You know that saying,

729
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.443
"The best way to get over a man
is to get under someone else,"

730
00:42:42.543 --> 00:42:43.811
What does that mean?

731
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:47.415
I asked Mrs, Park
in Samcheong-dong,,,

732
00:42:47.415 --> 00:42:50.084
to make a list,

733
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:53.087
She said he's known as,,,

734
00:42:53.087 --> 00:42:55.489
the best bachelor,

735
00:42:55.623 --> 00:42:59.493
Also, his father is a famous
acupuncturist,

736
00:42:59.493 --> 00:43:04.332
His mother rushed
to the burial site,

737
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:06.133
so she won't give you trouble,

738
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.637
Why would someone like him
marry a divorced woman like me?

739
00:43:09.837 --> 00:43:11.772
That's your mom's power,

740
00:43:11.772 --> 00:43:15.576
The power of money,

741
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:19.447
Sure then, Put it on,

742
00:43:19.914 --> 00:43:22.149
You'll be shocked,,,

743
00:43:22.149 --> 00:43:23.551
by his handsome face,

744
00:43:26.621 --> 00:43:29.924
Hello, I'm Oh Mok Sin, recently
promoted to a manager,,,

745
00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:33.094
from deputy
at Expressway corporation,

746
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.330
People call me Sir Mok Sin,

747
00:43:39.667 --> 00:43:41.836
See you,
There's nothing better than you,

748
00:43:43.938 --> 00:43:47.008
Gosh, Did she send the right one?

749
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:50.645
Mrs, Park in Samcheong-dong
must've gone insane,

750
00:43:52.146 --> 00:43:53.914
Mom, I'm not getting remarried,

751
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:56.117
I'll live alone like you,

752
00:44:07.361 --> 00:44:08.496
Ms, Hong,

753
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:11.365
Are you ready already?

754
00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:15.236
Did you know I was going to
ask you to go on a date?

755
00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:17.304
A date?

756
00:44:18.272 --> 00:44:20.141
I said I'll treat you better,

757
00:44:20.975 --> 00:44:25.012
I've reserved movie tickets
to go with you,

758
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.449
It's not the action movie I like,

759
00:44:28.683 --> 00:44:32.553
It's your favorite
melancholy romance,

760
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.289
I won't tell you the title,

761
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.658
Go watch it alone,

762
00:44:37.725 --> 00:44:39.593
I'm going to look for a job,

763
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.896
What? A job?

764
00:44:42.163 --> 00:44:44.298
Why would you need a job
when you have me?

765
00:44:44.532 --> 00:44:47.368
You asked me to give you a chance
for a month,

766
00:44:47.902 --> 00:44:50.438
If you don't change after a month,
I'm going to divorce you,

767
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:52.239
I need to find a way
to support myself,

768
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.141
I'm going to be late,

769
00:44:54.141 --> 00:44:56.143
Take care of your own meal,

770
00:44:58.813 --> 00:45:00.047
Hey,

771
00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:05.653
This isn't right,

772
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.223
Our first menu settled successfully,

773
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.827
We need to come up with a second
one, Do you have any ideas?

774
00:45:13.494 --> 00:45:15.696
I'll make one until next week,

775
00:45:16.063 --> 00:45:17.932
I'll work together
with Lee Myung Rang,

776
00:45:18.332 --> 00:45:19.600
Gosh,

777
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:22.903
I came up with a theme,

778
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.806
Do you want to go sample it?

779
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.174
Really?

780
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:29.944
Since it's lunch time, let's move,

781
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.278
- Yes,
- Yes,

782
00:45:38.853 --> 00:45:41.889
It's a nice company,

783
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:52.833
Someone might see us,

784
00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:54.368
Who?

785
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:02.076
Didn't you know?
It's been broken for a while,

786
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.815
- Gosh,
- Gosh,

787
00:46:07.815 --> 00:46:08.849
(Dad)

788
00:46:11.085 --> 00:46:12.953
Hello? Dad,

789
00:46:13.721 --> 00:46:15.055
Where?

790
00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:16.557
Hello?

791
00:46:18.392 --> 00:46:19.560
The call ended,

792
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.529
Why did he call at this hour?

793
00:46:21.629 --> 00:46:25.166
I don't know, He doesn't call me
during office hours,

794
00:46:28.936 --> 00:46:30.437
My goodness,

795
00:46:30.437 --> 00:46:32.506
If things work out
between your parents,

796
00:46:32.506 --> 00:46:33.908
you need to come to my house,

797
00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:35.142
Why?

798
00:46:35.142 --> 00:46:37.044
I need to introduce you
to my parents,

799
00:46:37.044 --> 00:46:39.947
I will tell them that
you're their future daughter-in-law,

800
00:46:44.318 --> 00:46:45.386
What is it?

801
00:46:45.686 --> 00:46:47.054
I'm nervous,

802
00:46:47.955 --> 00:46:51.392
I've never met
my boyfriend's parents before,

803
00:46:51.859 --> 00:46:53.427
I get more nervous,,,

804
00:46:53.794 --> 00:46:55.663
when I think about
visiting your parents,

805
00:46:58.432 --> 00:47:01.435
We should go visit my parents
much, much later,

806
00:47:01.836 --> 00:47:05.105
It'll be hard to persuade my father,

807
00:47:05.105 --> 00:47:07.908
Don't worry, I'm prepared for that,

808
00:47:14.548 --> 00:47:16.717
Why did the call end so suddenly?

809
00:47:18.652 --> 00:47:20.254
My gosh,

810
00:47:26.961 --> 00:47:28.929
Excuse me,

811
00:47:29.063 --> 00:47:31.932
I came to look for my daughter,
but she's not answering my calls,

812
00:47:32.333 --> 00:47:35.302
It's Lee Ru Ri who works at the
Menu Research and Development Team,

813
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.472
Yes, this is the
Menu Research and Development Team,

814
00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:42.910
I'm Lee Ru Ri's Father,

815
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:45.512
Hello, sir, It's Myung Rang,

816
00:47:45.512 --> 00:47:48.015
Hello, What's wrong?

817
00:47:49.416 --> 00:47:51.952
What? You're at the lobby?

818
00:47:52.519 --> 00:47:53.554
Yes,

819
00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:57.124
Of course, Just wait a moment,

820
00:47:58.626 --> 00:48:00.594
Gosh, I'm going to lose my mind,

821
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.435
Gosh, Ru Ri,

822
00:48:08.435 --> 00:48:10.204
You're going to die today,

823
00:48:20.247 --> 00:48:21.548
Is the restaurant far from here?

824
00:48:21.548 --> 00:48:23.884
No, it's just across the road,

825
00:48:25.586 --> 00:48:27.254
Goodness, that surprised me,

826
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:30.391
That person looks
exactly like my dad from behind,

827
00:48:31.792 --> 00:48:33.327
Why would he come here?

828
00:48:34.061 --> 00:48:35.262
No,

829
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:38.165
That jacket looks like
the birthday present,,,

830
00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:41.135
my brother got him for his birthday,

831
00:48:41.402 --> 00:48:42.903
There are many jackets like that,

832
00:48:43.003 --> 00:48:44.204
Let's go,

833
00:49:01.622 --> 00:49:02.723
Dad,

834
00:49:02.723 --> 00:49:03.824
Sir,

835
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.933
What,,, What are you,,,

836
00:49:14.001 --> 00:49:17.104
Why are you
at my daughter's company?

837
00:49:17.104 --> 00:49:19.406
Do you work here too?

838
00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.176
Dad, it's,,,

839
00:49:22.276 --> 00:49:24.845
Is he following you?

840
00:49:25.312 --> 00:49:29.583
Does he drag you around
and ask you to date him?

841
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:31.752
Is he forcing you
to go out with him?

842
00:49:31.752 --> 00:49:33.520
Dad, it's,,,

843
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.022
I can explain everything, sir,

844
00:49:35.022 --> 00:49:38.392
What? You scum, You stalker!

845
00:49:38.792 --> 00:49:39.893
Tell me the truth,

846
00:49:39.893 --> 00:49:42.396
Why did you come to
my daughter's company?

847
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:45.265
I heard there are many problems
concerning dating violence,

848
00:49:45.265 --> 00:49:48.268
Are you doing that? Are you?

849
00:49:48.268 --> 00:49:51.105
It's not like that Dad,
I'll tell you everything,

850
00:49:51.105 --> 00:49:52.473
In fact, we're,,,

851
00:49:52.473 --> 00:49:54.141
Move over,

852
00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:55.843
Honey,

853
00:49:59.046 --> 00:50:00.114
I'm sorry,

854
00:50:01.882 --> 00:50:03.851
I came too late,

855
00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:09.289
Are you,,, Is he,,,

856
00:50:10.858 --> 00:50:12.493
dating Myung Rang?

857
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.663
You're not dating Ru Ri?

858
00:50:17.064 --> 00:50:18.198
What?

859
00:50:22.202 --> 00:50:23.871
I,,, Yes,

860
00:50:24.872 --> 00:50:27.474
She's my girlfriend, sir,

861
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:33.047
He is, He's my boyfriend,
He came to see me,

862
00:50:34.148 --> 00:50:35.616
Right, honey?

863
00:50:35.816 --> 00:50:36.984
Yes,

864
00:50:40.921 --> 00:50:42.022
Let's go,

865
00:50:42.022 --> 00:50:43.023
All right,

866
00:50:43.023 --> 00:50:44.925
I'll see you next time,

867
00:50:48.662 --> 00:50:51.865
Gosh, he's totally trash,

868
00:50:52.232 --> 00:50:57.004
How could he date Myung Rang
right after he dated you?

869
00:50:57.204 --> 00:50:58.572
Gosh,

870
00:50:58.572 --> 00:51:02.843
Does that make Myung Rang
trash too?

871
00:51:02.976 --> 00:51:05.079
She's dating her friend's
ex-boyfriend,

872
00:51:05.279 --> 00:51:07.681
Stop talking about trash,

873
00:51:08.148 --> 00:51:10.584
Why did you come here?

874
00:51:10.584 --> 00:51:12.820
I wanted to see you,,,

875
00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:16.557
and the company that you work at,

876
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.595
My goodness,

877
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.602
Don't worry now, He's gone,

878
00:51:28.602 --> 00:51:30.637
Gosh, there are so many problems,

879
00:51:31.271 --> 00:51:33.040
He has a really bad image of me,

880
00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.143
Now that he thinks I'm dating you,
he'll think of me as total trash,

881
00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:39.613
Well, it's better to be trash
than to be beaten up and die,

882
00:51:39.913 --> 00:51:43.217
He's stressed out already
because of his divorce problems,

883
00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:46.620
If he had found out today,
you'd probably have died,

884
00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.856
But how would I recover my image?

885
00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:52.993
I don't know, You and Ru Ri
are going to have to,,,

886
00:51:52.993 --> 00:51:55.262
go through a lot of trouble,

887
00:52:04.338 --> 00:52:05.506
Yes, Chairman Kevin?

888
00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.775
Now? All right,

889
00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:14.414
Why is he calling me?

890
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:21.255
Oh, my, So this is where you work
all day?

891
00:52:24.625 --> 00:52:26.360
Is this the manager's room?

892
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.164
There's no one here because
it's lunch time, Let's go out,,,

893
00:52:30.164 --> 00:52:32.366
Yes, I know,

894
00:52:34.801 --> 00:52:37.404
His name is Jung Tae Yang?

895
00:52:38.205 --> 00:52:40.674
That's a nice name, Jung Tae Yang,

896
00:52:42.376 --> 00:52:45.012
Is he single? How old is he?

897
00:52:45.312 --> 00:52:46.813
Is he a nice person?

898
00:52:46.813 --> 00:52:47.848
What?

899
00:52:48.315 --> 00:52:51.385
Yes, He's 30 years old,

900
00:52:51.685 --> 00:52:53.720
and he's really nice,

901
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.222
Really?

902
00:52:56.123 --> 00:52:59.293
If he's a manager at a company
like this at 30,

903
00:52:59.293 --> 00:53:01.695
he's been promoted really fast
and has vision,

904
00:53:03.163 --> 00:53:05.866
When I come back next time,
I'll have to see what he looks like,

905
00:53:07.067 --> 00:53:08.235
Why?

906
00:53:08.502 --> 00:53:10.204
Why do you think?

907
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:12.940
I want to see if he's good enough
to be your husband,

908
00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.908
Oh, my, Yes,

909
00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:18.879
You'll like him,

910
00:53:18.879 --> 00:53:20.747
To me, he seems really great,

911
00:53:20.747 --> 00:53:24.184
Stop, Stop, Stop right there,

912
00:53:24.184 --> 00:53:27.554
You don't know
how to choose a good man,

913
00:53:28.188 --> 00:53:30.757
I'll choose who you get to marry,

914
00:53:34.895 --> 00:53:37.364
By the way, why did you
come all the way here?

915
00:53:40.334 --> 00:53:45.973
I don't know
what your mom is thinking,

916
00:53:45.973 --> 00:53:47.574
That's why I came here,

917
00:53:51.912 --> 00:53:53.280
(Smart Acupressure Bed)

918
00:53:53.413 --> 00:53:55.282
You should get a cover too,

919
00:53:57.084 --> 00:53:58.585
Excuse me,

920
00:53:58.585 --> 00:54:00.220
Hello,

921
00:54:00.954 --> 00:54:03.056
Is this who you were talking about?

922
00:54:03.357 --> 00:54:04.491
Yes,

923
00:54:04.491 --> 00:54:06.793
Where's Mr, Song?
We had an appointment,

924
00:54:06.793 --> 00:54:09.296
He went to Japan for
a business trip, He'll be back soon,

925
00:54:09.296 --> 00:54:10.430
Take a seat,

926
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:12.165
May I look around?

927
00:54:12.165 --> 00:54:13.367
Sure,

928
00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.235
Look over here,

929
00:54:16.937 --> 00:54:18.372
There's a wide variety,

930
00:54:24.978 --> 00:54:27.514
Go Jung Do is
Jung Tae Yang's stepfather,

931
00:54:38.292 --> 00:54:40.260
Did you have lunch, sir?

932
00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.828
What is it?

933
00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:43.964
I have something to tell you
about your son,

934
00:54:46.099 --> 00:54:47.434
Does that mean,,,

935
00:54:48.302 --> 00:54:50.037
you found out who he is?

936
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.373
It wasn't the investigators who
found out, I found out by chance,

937
00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.277
Really? Who is he? What is he like?

938
00:54:57.277 --> 00:54:59.513
Do you have his picture?

939
00:54:59.913 --> 00:55:02.616
You won't need one,

940
00:55:03.083 --> 00:55:05.218
You know who he is,

941
00:55:05.552 --> 00:55:08.255
What do you mean I know who he is?

942
00:55:08.322 --> 00:55:11.892
He's been taking care of you
close by,

943
00:55:11.892 --> 00:55:14.795
Explain, Who is this person,,,

944
00:55:14.795 --> 00:55:17.264
that I already know
and is close to me?

945
00:55:17.497 --> 00:55:18.765
Don't be surprised,

946
00:55:19.333 --> 00:55:20.834
This might be good news,

947
00:55:20.834 --> 00:55:23.003
Don't leave me dangling,
and just tell me,

948
00:55:23.003 --> 00:55:24.304
Who is it?

949
00:55:29.643 --> 00:55:30.811
He is,,,

950
00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:39.653
Chairman, Did you call me?

951
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.410
Show me how he looks, please,

952
00:56:03.477 --> 00:56:06.913
If that's too much,
give me his name,

953
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:18.725
If it's that painful,

954
00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.261
give this to him,

955
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:25.265
What's this?

956
00:56:35.876 --> 00:56:37.411
Where did you get all this?

957
00:56:37.411 --> 00:56:39.312
Your rich ex-husband,,,

958
00:56:39.312 --> 00:56:42.082
paid a private investigator
to follow you,

959
00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:45.085
Ex-husband?

960
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.555
You knew all along?

961
00:56:48.855 --> 00:56:51.224
That SC Chairman
is Tae Yang's father?

962
00:56:51.224 --> 00:56:52.426
That's not all,

963
00:56:53.527 --> 00:56:55.662
I already know you lied
about going to a class,,,

964
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:58.165
and met him instead,

965
00:56:58.665 --> 00:56:59.833
What?

966
00:57:01.001 --> 00:57:04.004
Why didn't you say anything
when you knew?

967
00:57:05.872 --> 00:57:09.176
Were you testing me
to see how I react?

968
00:57:09.609 --> 00:57:11.044
How can you do that?

969
00:57:11.044 --> 00:57:12.245
What?

970
00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:16.450
Are you sure
you're not falling for him already?

971
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:19.519
That's why you lied
about seeing him,,,

972
00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:21.688
every time I asked you,

973
00:57:21.688 --> 00:57:23.056
Don't say that,

974
00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:28.195
I met him because I asked
him a favor,

975
00:57:28.795 --> 00:57:30.931
I asked him not to get between us,

976
00:57:30.931 --> 00:57:33.033
and pretend
he doesn't know Tae Yang,

977
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.136
If you're going to doubt me,

978
00:57:36.436 --> 00:57:39.105
let's just end it,

979
00:57:40.774 --> 00:57:44.177
I've had enough already
because of your mom,

980
00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:46.146
Is that what you want?

981
00:57:46.646 --> 00:57:50.283
You're blaming Choi Sun Young
to go back to your rich husband?

982
00:57:50.317 --> 00:57:51.885
Go Jung Do,

983
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.888
Stop it please,

984
00:57:54.955 --> 00:57:56.423
What's wrong with you?

985
00:57:56.523 --> 00:57:58.825
You tell us to understand it,
but you're always fighting,

986
00:57:58.892 --> 00:58:00.293
This isn't family,

987
00:58:00.293 --> 00:58:02.963
Stop fighting, Stop fighting!

988
00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:18.278
Just one month,

989
00:58:18.311 --> 00:58:21.848
If I don't grasp your mom by then,
she's really going to divorce me,

990
00:58:22.415 --> 00:58:24.451
What should I do?

991
00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:27.854
Dad,

992
00:58:28.922 --> 00:58:31.758
Do you have any idea
how much Mom's suffering now?

993
00:58:32.692 --> 00:58:35.762
And that she seriously thought
about the divorce this time?

994
00:58:36.062 --> 00:58:39.266
That's why I'm here,

995
00:58:39.332 --> 00:58:41.468
Then you must change,

996
00:58:41.701 --> 00:58:44.137
You need to change everything
from A to Z,

997
00:58:44.871 --> 00:58:49.843
First, start by showing that
Mom's not inferior,

998
00:58:50.277 --> 00:58:52.979
but she deserves respect,,,

999
00:58:52.979 --> 00:58:54.614
like you,

1000
00:58:56.149 --> 00:58:57.450
Goodness,

1001
00:58:58.251 --> 00:59:01.655
I can't believe I'm hearing this
from my daughter,

1002
00:59:03.723 --> 00:59:06.993
Anyway, you're on my side,

1003
00:59:08.128 --> 00:59:10.597
or I won't help you getting married,

1004
00:59:15.168 --> 00:59:17.637
Bye, Go back to work,

1005
00:59:32.752 --> 00:59:36.056
Dad, I'll walk you
to the parking lot,

1006
00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:48.101
You must be having
an important conversation,

1007
00:59:48.168 --> 00:59:49.703
- I'll come back later,,,
- It doesn't matter,

1008
00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:53.073
If he's near me,
you probably know as well,

1009
00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:54.975
I don't need to hide it,

1010
00:59:56.543 --> 00:59:57.677
Tell me,

1011
00:59:58.912 --> 01:00:00.280
Who's my son?

1012
01:00:03.249 --> 01:00:05.585
It's fine, Tell me,

1013
01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.923
Sir, I'll come back later,

1014
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:11.658
Please continue,

1015
01:00:17.731 --> 01:00:18.965
What's wrong with you?

1016
01:00:19.132 --> 01:00:21.368
I said I'm okay,
Why would you hesitate?

1017
01:00:21.835 --> 01:00:23.603
- Chairman,
- Say it,

1018
01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:25.605
Who is he?

1019
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.308
Jung Tae Yang's stepfather is,,,

1020
01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:31.578
Go Jung Do,

1021
01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:33.346
What?

1022
01:00:35.315 --> 01:00:36.983
If his stepfather is Go Jung Do,

1023
01:00:37.684 --> 01:00:39.085
- Ms, Jung Hwa Young,
- Ms, Jung Hwa Young,

1024
01:00:39.085 --> 01:00:41.121
His mother's beautiful,

1025
01:00:41.121 --> 01:00:42.722
She does dance sport,

1026
01:00:42.856 --> 01:00:45.392
and she lives with a husband
who is 10 years younger than her,

1027
01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:49.062
Mom suffered a lot until
she became this happy,

1028
01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:52.365
She failed many times before,

1029
01:00:56.369 --> 01:00:58.238
Wait, Then,,,

1030
01:01:00.206 --> 01:01:02.308
Jung Tae Yang, That kid,,,

1031
01:01:03.009 --> 01:01:04.844
Is he my son?

1032
01:01:05.812 --> 01:01:07.113
Yes, sir,

1033
01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.233
Tae Yang,

1034
01:01:28.902 --> 01:01:30.136
Where are you?

1035
01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.039
I'm in the parking lot
to go to the restaurant,

1036
01:01:33.039 --> 01:01:34.641
Come back now!

1037
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.344
Okay, Dad?

1038
01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:42.582
Respect Mom as much as you,

1039
01:01:42.582 --> 01:01:45.852
Don't get upset or yell at her,

1040
01:01:45.852 --> 01:01:48.455
I don't want my family
to fall apart,

1041
01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:52.058
You nag just like your mom,

1042
01:01:52.192 --> 01:01:53.827
I get it,

1043
01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.297
Don't worry about me,
Go back to work,

1044
01:01:57.497 --> 01:02:00.433
At least pretend you're working
hard since you're stupid,

1045
01:02:06.272 --> 01:02:09.075
He's still here?

1046
01:02:14.414 --> 01:02:15.582
Manager Jung,

1047
01:02:19.853 --> 01:02:21.054
Jung Tae Yang,

1048
01:02:21.421 --> 01:02:24.057
What? Jung Tae Yang?

1049
01:02:24.524 --> 01:02:28.595
He's your manager?

1050
01:02:29.929 --> 01:02:31.464
- Dad,
- Wait,

1051
01:02:37.871 --> 01:02:39.139
Tell me,

1052
01:02:39.572 --> 01:02:40.740
What's your name?

1053
01:02:41.541 --> 01:02:42.876
It's Jung Tae Yang,

1054
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:44.244
What?

1055
01:02:44.544 --> 01:02:48.715
You've been working
with my daughter until now?

1056
01:02:49.082 --> 01:02:50.984
You've been lying all this time?

1057
01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:52.986
I'm sorry,

1058
01:02:53.219 --> 01:02:54.487
You jerk,

1059
01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.056
Dad,

1060
01:03:14.274 --> 01:03:15.775
Sleeping lion's whiskers,,,

1061
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:19.245
Whiskers, whiskers, whiskers,,,

1062
01:03:19.913 --> 01:03:21.114
Wait,

1063
01:03:22.282 --> 01:03:24.083
It's not me,

1064
01:03:24.584 --> 01:03:26.386
Domestic violence!

1065
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.622
- Dad,
- I got it until there,

1066
01:03:29.622 --> 01:03:30.824
No, you didn't,

1067
01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:34.060
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1068
01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.663
Are you saying it's a coincidence
to open hospital on top of my store?

1069
01:03:36.663 --> 01:03:38.431
It's the hot place of Gangbuk,

1070
01:03:38.431 --> 01:03:40.266
My father searched
over and over again,

1071
01:03:40.266 --> 01:03:42.268
Can I ask you one thing?

1072
01:03:42.268 --> 01:03:43.703
Get away from Jung Tae Yang,

1073
01:03:43.703 --> 01:03:45.471
Are you his father or something?

1074
01:03:45.471 --> 01:03:46.472
I'm getting married,

1075
01:03:46.472 --> 01:03:48.875
I'm going to leave this house
with Lee Ru Ri,

1076
01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:51.144
You'll be my son from now on,

1077
01:03:51.144 --> 01:03:53.346
He's on a roll because
the chairman loves him,

1078
01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:55.515
I won't him to stop falling
because of you,

1079
01:03:55.515 --> 01:03:59.219
I'd rather benefit from my
ex-husband rather than living poor,

1080
01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.354
Your mom's real name is Anna Kang,

1081
01:04:01.354 --> 01:04:04.424
She ran away after murder attempt,
She must be punished,
