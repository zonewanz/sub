00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:09.753
(Episode 24)

2
00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:12.022
Bye.

3
00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:13.792
Goodbye.

4
00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:24.102
Do you want to come in for a moment?

5
00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:26.473
No, I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

6
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.473
All right.

7
00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:45.493
Sweet dreams.

8
00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:48.322
All right. Goodnight.

9
00:01:11.983 --> 00:01:13.412
Jin Jin, let's have breakfast.

10
00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:17.653
Why are you up so early and putting on makeup already?

11
00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:19.423
You don't need to know.

12
00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:24.532
Don't I look stunning?

13
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.433
Hello, Lawyer Kang.

14
00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:36.272
You're early, Lawyer Jang.

15
00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:53.052
Mr. Kang.

16
00:01:55.362 --> 00:01:58.763
About what I did yesterday, I...

17
00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:02.433
Lawyer Jang, can I have...

18
00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:04.673
the hit-and-run case files?

19
00:02:05.272 --> 00:02:08.302
- Right now? - Yes, I need them urgently.

20
00:02:08.943 --> 00:02:09.943
Okay.

21
00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:26.022
Mr. Kang, yesterday, I...

22
00:02:26.022 --> 00:02:28.062
I think I have a meeting today.

23
00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:29.723
Enjoy your lunch.

24
00:02:41.242 --> 00:02:42.642
This is so awkward.

25
00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:52.853
Good morning, Ah Reum.

26
00:03:31.522 --> 00:03:32.853
(Bombed Jung Woo Sung)

27
00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:34.022
I'm here.

28
00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:56.812
Did you sleep well?

29
00:03:57.242 --> 00:03:59.112
What? Yes.

30
00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:01.552
Did you have sweet dreams?

31
00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:03.152
Yes.

32
00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:07.223
Why does this feel so awkward?

33
00:04:07.223 --> 00:04:09.622
Shall we listen to music?

34
00:04:09.622 --> 00:04:12.163
- Sure. - Okay.

35
00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:20.202
Ah Reum.

36
00:04:22.043 --> 00:04:23.173
Here.

37
00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:52.833
Thanks a lot.

38
00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:04.583
My goodness.

39
00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:07.112
You're the couple of the century.

40
00:05:07.523 --> 00:05:09.023
Is it all that great?

41
00:05:09.523 --> 00:05:10.692
Is there no pressure at all?

42
00:05:11.593 --> 00:05:14.593
I like this the most. "Where the Wind Stops".

43
00:05:14.593 --> 00:05:15.762
What's that about?

44
00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:19.132
A couple of mummified remains unearthed after over 500 years.

45
00:05:19.132 --> 00:05:22.103
The drama's about who they were.

46
00:05:22.103 --> 00:05:24.973
- Who were they? - Princess Hyohye.

47
00:05:24.973 --> 00:05:26.702
Two men fight for her love.

48
00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.572
The first candidate...

49
00:05:28.572 --> 00:05:32.442
is the eldest son of the powerful Minister of Justice.

50
00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:33.643
The second candidate...

51
00:05:33.942 --> 00:05:37.512
is her bodyguard who vowed to protect her with his life.

52
00:05:37.512 --> 00:05:39.653
Which of those men joined...

53
00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:41.783
the princess in the afterlife?

54
00:05:41.783 --> 00:05:43.882
Is it about identifying a mummy's husband?

55
00:05:43.882 --> 00:05:45.223
That's exactly it.

56
00:05:45.552 --> 00:05:47.793
I hope it's the bodyguard.

57
00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:51.562
Anyone can tell it's obviously the minister's son.

58
00:05:51.562 --> 00:05:53.093
My love never changes.

59
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.733
- Who is it? - It's a secret.

60
00:05:56.862 --> 00:05:59.473
I choose this. Call the production company.

61
00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:03.202
- Where are you going? - On a date.

62
00:06:56.963 --> 00:06:58.393
This was your wish.

63
00:07:01.932 --> 00:07:03.502
I read your interview.

64
00:07:04.903 --> 00:07:07.442
You know everything about me,

65
00:07:07.543 --> 00:07:10.343
but I know nothing about you.

66
00:07:13.872 --> 00:07:17.952
I waited for you here every day, so I tried everything on the menu.

67
00:07:18.112 --> 00:07:20.353
I can guess blindfolded what each bread...

68
00:07:20.353 --> 00:07:22.423
should feel like or what viscosity...

69
00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:24.023
each dressing should be.

70
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:29.723
I was an unofficial taste tester whenever they had a new menu.

71
00:07:29.723 --> 00:07:31.432
You said you'd never eat it again.

72
00:07:31.432 --> 00:07:33.533
I got so sick of sandwiches,

73
00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:36.802
- I promised never to eat one again. - With whom?

74
00:07:36.802 --> 00:07:38.002
With myself.

75
00:07:38.903 --> 00:07:42.273
My one exception was if I ate it with you.

76
00:07:44.312 --> 00:07:46.173
Dreams come true.

77
00:07:49.012 --> 00:07:50.442
I succeeded.

78
00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:51.612
Me too.

79
00:07:52.283 --> 00:07:53.713
I succeeded too.

80
00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.733
You went shopping alone in the cold?

81
00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:09.132
I'd have driven you back if you'd called.

82
00:08:09.132 --> 00:08:12.202
What for when you're so busy?

83
00:08:12.202 --> 00:08:15.002
The older we get, the more we should move about.

84
00:08:15.103 --> 00:08:17.143
Were you out for long? It's very cold.

85
00:08:17.143 --> 00:08:20.882
It's not too bad. I'll cook cod fish tonight.

86
00:08:22.742 --> 00:08:24.913
Now that it's colder, my husband has been...

87
00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:26.882
whining for cod soup.

88
00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:30.382
I wonder how many of them he'll eat this year if he starts...

89
00:08:30.382 --> 00:08:31.893
craving cod soup already.

90
00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:35.763
I'll make some nice, refreshing soup.

91
00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:41.163
- Go on home. - No, it's fine.

92
00:08:41.163 --> 00:08:42.602
- Thanks. - Open the door.

93
00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:20.102
Chopin was 19 years old...

94
00:09:20.102 --> 00:09:22.442
when he first fell in love...

95
00:09:22.442 --> 00:09:24.812
with a woman.

96
00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:27.883
His first love was Konstancja Gladkowska,

97
00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:30.682
and he wrote this for her.

98
00:09:30.682 --> 00:09:32.413
Listening to this piece...

99
00:09:33.383 --> 00:09:36.253
makes me feel the hot and fierce...

100
00:09:36.253 --> 00:09:38.793
but innocent love a 19-year-old...

101
00:09:38.793 --> 00:09:42.962
would feel for his first love.

102
00:09:42.993 --> 00:09:44.192
It's something like...

103
00:09:45.592 --> 00:09:46.793
us.

104
00:09:49.462 --> 00:09:51.673
This is so uncomfortable.

105
00:09:58.043 --> 00:10:00.312
Why are we eating pork belly?

106
00:10:00.543 --> 00:10:02.743
It's our first date.

107
00:10:02.743 --> 00:10:06.113
Shouldn't we eat at a romantic restaurant?

108
00:10:06.852 --> 00:10:10.182
Cow, pig, chicken.

109
00:10:10.182 --> 00:10:11.523
Remember just that.

110
00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:14.822
My three favorite things.

111
00:10:14.923 --> 00:10:16.092
Okay.

112
00:10:16.623 --> 00:10:19.432
What about me, then?

113
00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:21.033
You?

114
00:10:25.673 --> 00:10:28.072
- I'll add you too. - You'll add me?

115
00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:31.572
That sounds like you're adding something to the order.

116
00:10:32.373 --> 00:10:34.143
- Are you okay? - It didn't splash.

117
00:10:34.143 --> 00:10:36.543
- Do you want my apron? - It's fine.

118
00:10:36.543 --> 00:10:40.052
It's covered in grime from other people's necks and hands...

119
00:10:41.352 --> 00:10:42.482
It's okay.

120
00:10:51.763 --> 00:10:53.993
Do you want another soup?

121
00:10:53.993 --> 00:10:56.363
- That's fine. - What?

122
00:10:56.363 --> 00:10:57.602
We're...

123
00:10:58.373 --> 00:10:59.873
close.

124
00:11:03.302 --> 00:11:06.972
Okay, so there's something I've never done in my life.

125
00:11:06.972 --> 00:11:10.852
It's something I'd always wanted to do.

126
00:11:10.852 --> 00:11:12.952
To feed someone.

127
00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:15.123
People are watching.

128
00:11:15.123 --> 00:11:18.092
Who cares? Isn't this what all couples do?

129
00:11:18.092 --> 00:11:21.123
Open wide. It's fine. Go on.

130
00:11:23.293 --> 00:11:25.633
Oh, no. Is it too hot?

131
00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:28.863
- It's okay. - Sorry.

132
00:11:34.503 --> 00:11:35.673
Hang on.

133
00:11:39.472 --> 00:11:42.582
Hold still, okay, Ah Reum?

134
00:11:43.643 --> 00:11:44.682
Hang on.

135
00:11:46.153 --> 00:11:48.653
There's grease on your face.

136
00:11:49.852 --> 00:11:51.852
I got it all.

137
00:11:51.952 --> 00:11:53.793
Are you okay?

138
00:11:53.793 --> 00:11:55.562
Yes, I'm okay.

139
00:11:55.822 --> 00:11:57.932
Shall I have some soup?

140
00:12:05.072 --> 00:12:06.173
I'm okay.

141
00:12:08.143 --> 00:12:09.202
I'm okay.

142
00:12:26.153 --> 00:12:28.322
Is it my birthday today?

143
00:12:29.562 --> 00:12:32.033
All my wishes came true.

144
00:12:33.863 --> 00:12:35.832
Going out for drinks alone with you.

145
00:12:35.932 --> 00:12:38.373
That was also on my wish list.

146
00:12:38.832 --> 00:12:40.102
Quite high up.

147
00:12:43.273 --> 00:12:45.413
What other wishes do you have?

148
00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:48.942
It's a secret.

149
00:12:49.743 --> 00:12:52.082
I'll tell you if they come true.

150
00:12:57.822 --> 00:13:00.552
Being a celebrity helped me realize...

151
00:13:01.523 --> 00:13:03.592
how hard it must've been for you.

152
00:13:04.893 --> 00:13:08.432
People misunderstand you regardless of your intentions,

153
00:13:09.263 --> 00:13:11.273
and your truth gets misconstrued.

154
00:13:12.102 --> 00:13:15.602
However loud you shout, no one listens.

155
00:13:15.942 --> 00:13:18.312
That's so upsetting and frustrating.

156
00:13:19.143 --> 00:13:21.842
You must've felt like that so much.

157
00:13:23.582 --> 00:13:25.352
That's when I thought...

158
00:13:25.712 --> 00:13:28.923
it would be nice if I could hear you vent over a drink.

159
00:13:29.682 --> 00:13:30.923
Just between us.

160
00:13:33.322 --> 00:13:35.923
Can I listen to your secrets for you?

161
00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:37.592
I'd love that.

162
00:13:39.393 --> 00:13:40.832
It'll be boring.

163
00:13:41.133 --> 00:13:42.533
There's nothing special.

164
00:13:45.373 --> 00:13:46.832
Then between us two,

165
00:13:48.003 --> 00:13:51.113
we'll tell each other everything honestly, okay?

166
00:13:54.942 --> 00:13:56.143
Jin Jin.

167
00:13:57.482 --> 00:13:58.712
Do you like someone?

168
00:14:03.182 --> 00:14:05.192
Yes, I do.

169
00:14:08.423 --> 00:14:10.592
I was going to tell you first.

170
00:14:12.332 --> 00:14:13.732
He must be a good guy.

171
00:14:16.202 --> 00:14:17.263
Actually...

172
00:14:17.263 --> 00:14:19.673
I think we got really close.

173
00:14:20.432 --> 00:14:21.942
I knew before you said it.

174
00:14:27.883 --> 00:14:30.543
- "We Got Married"... - About that.

175
00:14:35.182 --> 00:14:36.253
Let's quit.

176
00:14:38.052 --> 00:14:39.153
Let's...

177
00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:40.962
quit the show.

178
00:14:44.263 --> 00:14:46.562
But it's not just about us.

179
00:14:46.993 --> 00:14:50.403
We both have agencies, and we must think of the show.

180
00:14:51.102 --> 00:14:52.802
We can't quit right away.

181
00:14:53.533 --> 00:14:55.442
It won't be easy for you,

182
00:14:56.903 --> 00:14:58.472
but let's do our best...

183
00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:00.643
until we drop out.

184
00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:26.899
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E24 20th Century Boy & Girl "I Know Nothing about You"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

185
00:15:47.722 --> 00:15:49.692
Your eyes are failing, aren't they?

186
00:15:50.263 --> 00:15:51.533
See a doctor.

187
00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:53.062
I will, I will.

188
00:15:53.533 --> 00:15:56.062
Don't say a word to Jin Jin.

189
00:16:07.143 --> 00:16:09.212
It won't be easy for you,

190
00:16:10.543 --> 00:16:12.013
but let's do our best...

191
00:16:12.852 --> 00:16:14.222
until we drop out.

192
00:16:27.293 --> 00:16:28.332
Jin Jin.

193
00:16:29.163 --> 00:16:30.602
- What? - Aren't you hungry?

194
00:16:31.173 --> 00:16:32.273
I am.

195
00:16:34.503 --> 00:16:38.143
A mom packed her son a block of white rice cake.

196
00:16:38.442 --> 00:16:42.543
He ate pieces of it during class when his teacher saw him.

197
00:16:42.643 --> 00:16:45.383
He pretended it was an eraser.

198
00:16:48.623 --> 00:16:49.923
That was lame.

199
00:16:49.923 --> 00:16:51.993
- I made you laugh. - It wasn't funny.

200
00:16:52.653 --> 00:16:54.893
- You laughed. - I was dumbfounded.

201
00:16:56.123 --> 00:16:59.393
A kid wanted to leave school by pretending to be sick,

202
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:01.403
so he warmed his ear with a hair dryer.

203
00:17:01.633 --> 00:17:03.663
The school nurse took his temperature,

204
00:17:03.832 --> 00:17:05.472
and it was over 80°C.

205
00:17:07.403 --> 00:17:09.103
See, it's funny.

206
00:17:09.603 --> 00:17:11.212
Eat your food.

207
00:17:11.913 --> 00:17:15.843
This kid kept on pretending her friend's jokes weren't funny.

208
00:17:16.113 --> 00:17:17.853
So the kid's friend...

209
00:17:20.083 --> 00:17:21.452
kept on telling...

210
00:17:21.452 --> 00:17:23.623
Okay, okay. Let's eat.

211
00:17:29.262 --> 00:17:31.032
It's good.

212
00:17:45.843 --> 00:17:47.113
Aren't you hungry?

213
00:17:47.313 --> 00:17:49.012
Shall I steam some sweet potatoes?

214
00:17:50.042 --> 00:17:51.113
Mom.

215
00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:53.782
Wash the cups properly.

216
00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:33.153
We plan to use...

217
00:18:33.153 --> 00:18:36.992
Sa Jin Jin at the forefront of our global marketing campaign.

218
00:18:37.123 --> 00:18:40.962
Come up with some nice concepts that suit the needs of each market.

219
00:18:40.962 --> 00:18:42.202
Yes, sir.

220
00:18:42.303 --> 00:18:45.303
The main poster will accentuate Ms. Sa's elegant and...

221
00:18:45.303 --> 00:18:49.542
feminine image to promote our mineral hot spring.

222
00:18:49.803 --> 00:18:51.012
Thank you.

223
00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:52.472
Sir, wait.

224
00:18:53.012 --> 00:18:54.042
Sir.

225
00:18:54.042 --> 00:18:56.343
- I'm leaving early today. - Is something wrong?

226
00:18:56.982 --> 00:18:58.083
Yes.

227
00:19:03.053 --> 00:19:05.423
I'm bothering a very busy man.

228
00:19:05.653 --> 00:19:07.393
What a nuisance I am.

229
00:19:07.962 --> 00:19:09.423
I don't need to go.

230
00:19:09.762 --> 00:19:12.462
Nothing bad comes from seeing a doctor often.

231
00:19:12.462 --> 00:19:14.103
Especially when you're older.

232
00:19:14.363 --> 00:19:16.462
Consider the doctor a good friend,

233
00:19:16.462 --> 00:19:19.373
and call and visit him or her as often as you can.

234
00:19:19.373 --> 00:19:24.042
The older we get, the more things need fixing.

235
00:19:24.343 --> 00:19:27.542
I notice myself slouching, and my brain isn't as nimble.

236
00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:29.583
Even my eyes are dim.

237
00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:33.212
Don't worry too much. The doctor will run some tests.

238
00:19:33.682 --> 00:19:37.752
How are you so thoughtful and kind?

239
00:19:38.492 --> 00:19:40.653
Kwang Hee won't need a daughter.

240
00:19:40.792 --> 00:19:42.593
My sister's really pretty.

241
00:20:02.212 --> 00:20:03.613
Nice.

242
00:20:08.383 --> 00:20:09.952
What's this?

243
00:20:21.032 --> 00:20:23.932
Jeong Eun, this is bad. What should we do?

244
00:20:34.413 --> 00:20:36.482
- Chul Min. - Hi.

245
00:20:36.883 --> 00:20:38.383
This is unbelievable.

246
00:20:39.353 --> 00:20:40.452
So...

247
00:20:41.383 --> 00:20:42.923
I should tell you,

248
00:20:43.682 --> 00:20:44.923
but then...

249
00:20:45.222 --> 00:20:47.292
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

250
00:20:48.093 --> 00:20:49.363
Is something wrong?

251
00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:54.303
Did you know about Jin Jin and Ji Won?

252
00:20:56.502 --> 00:20:58.833
What are they both thinking?

253
00:20:59.232 --> 00:21:01.002
I feel so betrayed.

254
00:21:01.373 --> 00:21:04.472
Jin Jin's cruel, but what was Ji Won thinking?

255
00:21:04.643 --> 00:21:06.012
How could he?

256
00:21:06.313 --> 00:21:08.482
- How'd you find out? - I saw a photo.

257
00:21:08.742 --> 00:21:12.012
I'm so flabbergasted I can't speak.

258
00:21:12.153 --> 00:21:13.313
That's enough.

259
00:21:14.853 --> 00:21:15.923
Do you...

260
00:21:17.053 --> 00:21:18.053
want to see it?

261
00:21:19.553 --> 00:21:20.923
They'll print it tomorrow.

262
00:21:25.363 --> 00:21:27.833
Put your chin and forehead on the machine.

263
00:21:30.633 --> 00:21:32.932
I'll shoot a little bit of air.

264
00:21:33.633 --> 00:21:35.472
Do you see the red dot?

265
00:21:36.002 --> 00:21:37.442
Can you look into it?

266
00:21:40.813 --> 00:21:42.712
And the left side too.

267
00:21:56.123 --> 00:21:58.333
Ma'am, take a look at this.

268
00:21:58.893 --> 00:22:01.502
You don't see a lot of red on this side,

269
00:22:01.502 --> 00:22:03.932
but you see a lot of red on this one.

270
00:22:05.373 --> 00:22:07.073
If you see a lot of red,

271
00:22:07.073 --> 00:22:10.103
it means your optic nerves are damaged.

272
00:22:10.712 --> 00:22:13.742
What? Does this mean there is a problem?

273
00:22:13.742 --> 00:22:15.113
You're suffering from glaucoma.

274
00:22:15.942 --> 00:22:18.752
It must've been frustrating not to be able to see well.

275
00:22:19.113 --> 00:22:20.553
Yes.

276
00:22:20.883 --> 00:22:22.982
It was a bit frustrating,

277
00:22:22.982 --> 00:22:25.623
but I figured it was due to aging.

278
00:22:25.623 --> 00:22:28.623
Most people don't see any symptoms...

279
00:22:28.623 --> 00:22:30.563
in the beginning stages of glaucoma.

280
00:22:30.563 --> 00:22:34.333
They begin to feel uncomfortable when their vision narrows.

281
00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:37.333
It's the same with your case.

282
00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:39.633
The surrounding optic nerves have already been damaged.

283
00:22:39.633 --> 00:22:41.772
And the nerves in the center are in the process of getting damaged.

284
00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:46.173
So what can she do?

285
00:22:46.173 --> 00:22:49.742
It's difficult to resuscitate the nerves that are damaged.

286
00:22:50.282 --> 00:22:52.682
For now, all she can do is take preventative measures...

287
00:22:52.682 --> 00:22:54.353
to stop the center nerves from getting damaged.

288
00:22:54.823 --> 00:22:57.553
But the damaging process is getting faster and faster.

289
00:22:57.653 --> 00:23:01.363
Once it reaches the center, she might lose her vision entirely.

290
00:23:01.363 --> 00:23:03.692
She should begin the treatment immediately.

291
00:23:12.633 --> 00:23:15.103
- Ji Won. - Yes?

292
00:23:16.573 --> 00:23:18.843
I'll tell my family.

293
00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:22.282
Okay. Don't worry.

294
00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:24.813
You can take medicine, get laser treatments, or surgery.

295
00:23:24.813 --> 00:23:27.782
We can try many things, so it'll be all right.

296
00:23:28.182 --> 00:23:29.823
If it hadn't been for you,

297
00:23:29.823 --> 00:23:33.593
I would've sat around with a pair of reading glasses.

298
00:23:34.123 --> 00:23:37.792
The doctor said I could've lost my vision altogether.

299
00:23:39.063 --> 00:23:40.932
You'll get treated.

300
00:23:42.863 --> 00:23:43.863
Sure.

301
00:23:47.303 --> 00:23:49.073
The wind is cold,

302
00:23:49.643 --> 00:23:51.873
but the sky is so bright.

303
00:24:25.413 --> 00:24:27.272
This is huge.

304
00:24:27.272 --> 00:24:29.182
It'll make the headlines right away.

305
00:24:29.182 --> 00:24:32.383
I'll post it online at 7am, the commuting hour. Sure.

306
00:24:38.153 --> 00:24:39.292
What do you want?

307
00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:43.492
I said, what do you want?

308
00:24:44.093 --> 00:24:47.163
Who is it? Who told you about this?

309
00:24:48.163 --> 00:24:50.833
How did you find out?

310
00:24:53.903 --> 00:24:55.673
Let's talk outside.

311
00:25:02.643 --> 00:25:04.913
Anthony, I feel really bad for you too.

312
00:25:05.313 --> 00:25:08.153
I thought your career would take off thanks to Jin Jin.

313
00:25:08.252 --> 00:25:10.383
What kind of a soap opera is this?

314
00:25:11.353 --> 00:25:13.692
Anyway, you really had no idea, did you?

315
00:25:13.692 --> 00:25:15.163
Reporter Jeong.

316
00:25:15.163 --> 00:25:17.163
Are you sure you kept it a secret because of "We Got Married"?

317
00:25:17.163 --> 00:25:19.962
It must feel like he took your wife away.

318
00:25:21.863 --> 00:25:24.903
You're a victim. I understand that you're angry.

319
00:25:25.573 --> 00:25:27.442
I understand why you came here.

320
00:25:28.742 --> 00:25:31.512
But so what? What do you want me to do?

321
00:25:49.992 --> 00:25:51.663
Please, I ask of you.

322
00:26:22.722 --> 00:26:25.962
Goodness, Ji Won. I'm causing you trouble...

323
00:26:25.962 --> 00:26:27.663
all day long.

324
00:26:27.663 --> 00:26:29.532
It's not troublesome.

325
00:26:30.903 --> 00:26:33.603
Let's eat some noodles for dinner tonight.

326
00:26:33.603 --> 00:26:35.002
Okay, sounds great.

327
00:26:47.423 --> 00:26:48.782
Hello?

328
00:26:50.653 --> 00:26:52.022
Hello?

329
00:27:03.702 --> 00:27:05.002
Ho Sung.

330
00:27:13.742 --> 00:27:14.883
Ho Sung.

331
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:19.113
Why didn't you call last month?

332
00:27:19.113 --> 00:27:21.682
Do you know how worried I was?

333
00:27:23.452 --> 00:27:27.292
It's winter, so your bronchial tubes must be giving you a tough time.

334
00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:30.563
Goodness, my daughter.

335
00:27:32.032 --> 00:27:34.732
Make sure you have some bellflower root tea.

336
00:27:34.903 --> 00:27:37.502
And don't eat anything too cold.

337
00:28:01.992 --> 00:28:03.522
Ho Sung.

338
00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:06.732
Where are you?

339
00:28:09.163 --> 00:28:11.873
There is not a day...

340
00:28:11.873 --> 00:28:16.442
when I don't think about you.

341
00:28:17.913 --> 00:28:20.512
Ho Sung, don't you miss me?

342
00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:27.113
I went to see a doctor today,

343
00:28:27.883 --> 00:28:29.623
and the doctor said...

344
00:28:30.522 --> 00:28:33.053
I'm rather ill.

345
00:28:35.063 --> 00:28:36.323
He said...

346
00:28:37.962 --> 00:28:40.932
I might not be able to see you anymore.

347
00:28:43.603 --> 00:28:45.432
That's not good.

348
00:28:46.903 --> 00:28:49.002
That really isn't good.

349
00:28:52.613 --> 00:28:56.182
I really want to see you, my daughter.

350
00:28:59.752 --> 00:29:01.282
Ho Sung.

351
00:29:03.383 --> 00:29:06.022
What if we can never see each other again?

352
00:29:08.462 --> 00:29:10.163
Let's make sure we meet...

353
00:29:11.262 --> 00:29:13.593
before that happens.

354
00:30:01.643 --> 00:30:03.712
What are you doing here? Come in.
