1
00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:08.685
Among the 12 keys the players have,

2
00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.915
one of the keys is Angel's Master Key, and one is Demon's Master Key.

3
00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:16.025
(Avengers of the Master Key joined the show.)

4
00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:18.095
(The battle between the Angel and Demon becomes fiercer.)

5
00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:21.125
(They have to find the player who has Angel's Master Key.)

6
00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:23.465
(What will be the result of the players' fierce match?)

7
00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:25.134
They pretend like they don't know anything.

8
00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:27.705
Why did you get an X when you are the Demon?

9
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.264
- It's going to be fun. - Yes, it is.

10
00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.174
- Welcome, everyone. - Welcome.

11
00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:33.744
Don't feel awkward.

12
00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:35.845
- Master Village looks different. - Yes, it's changed.

13
00:00:37.674 --> 00:00:38.775
We are all going together.

14
00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:40.884
(Hot 12 players joined today's upgraded match.)

15
00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:42.214
- Welcome, everyone. - We're the only girls.

16
00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:43.314
- Don't feel awkward. - Gosh.

17
00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.214
(Lee Sang Min, Seo Jang Hoon, Kim Hee Chul)

18
00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:48.354
Don't do anything stupid.

19
00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:50.284
What do you mean?

20
00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.765
We already know each other.

21
00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:55.924
- Is it here? - Thank you.

22
00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:58.864
- Old men, come here. - It looks nice here.

23
00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:01.134
This place is huge. We will have to run a lot today.

24
00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:02.305
Here comes the groom.

25
00:01:02.405 --> 00:01:03.604
(He starts to fool around from the beginning.)

26
00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:05.074
He's so tall.

27
00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:07.705
I haven't been outside for so long. I feel shy.

28
00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:10.674
- Do we go there? - I think so.

29
00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:12.944
Why are you acting this way?

30
00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:16.784
To catch Jang Hoon, we should have brought something.

31
00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:18.885
It's her first time to be on a variety show.

32
00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:20.754
- I like it here. - It's way better here.

33
00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:22.485
- Is it better here? - SBS has a lot of money.

34
00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:24.554
This show has a lot of money.

35
00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:25.955
What is this place?

36
00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.564
(They start the game in Room of Fate.)

37
00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:30.534
I like how they designed the room.

38
00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:34.205
You guys can stand wherever you want.

39
00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:37.174
- Can we do that now? - You guys can choose your place.

40
00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:41.444
You can choose the keys as well. It all depends on your luck.

41
00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:42.845
Do you want to swap our places?

42
00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.375
Your key is a golden key.

43
00:01:45.614 --> 00:01:47.914
Let's change. I like it here.

44
00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:50.814
(These two decided to change their places.)

45
00:01:50.814 --> 00:01:51.885
It's a golden key.

46
00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:55.024
You guys can guess the Master Keys and choose your places.

47
00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:56.455
It's nice to meet you all.

48
00:01:56.455 --> 00:01:59.024
Welcome to Master Key.

49
00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:03.965
This set looks awesome.

50
00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.235
Everyone looks nice in their suits as well.

51
00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:07.564
(He gets surprised to see everyone in their nice suits.)

52
00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:09.235
Daniel is standing right in front of me.

53
00:02:10.105 --> 00:02:12.535
Please greet the viewers.

54
00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:13.535
I feel awkward.

55
00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:15.674
Hello, I'm the superstar of the universe, Kim Hee Chul.

56
00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:16.975
Good. That was a good one.

57
00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:18.344
Hello, I'm Lee Sang Min.

58
00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:20.885
He looks good today.

59
00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.445
He is the second on brand reputation rankings.

60
00:02:24.154 --> 00:02:26.285
He was the first for the last six months.

61
00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:28.084
It was too overrated though.

62
00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:29.355
I can't be the first one.

63
00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:33.124
I am living a great life these days.

64
00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:36.765
It feels like I am living my dream every day.

65
00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:38.795
Hello, I am Seo Jang Hoon.

66
00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.535
What do you prefer between a game and mystery game?

67
00:02:41.804 --> 00:02:44.834
I prefer the mystery game.

68
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:48.144
I am good at it. As I am old now, I am quite experienced.

69
00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:51.844
I am lucky to play the game with these great idol singers.

70
00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:52.844
(He tries to win against idol singers.)

71
00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:56.315
- I and Ji Min have met before. - That's right.

72
00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:59.485
- How did you guys meet? - She's one of my favorite singers.

73
00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:05.024
Her dad was my senior when I was at college.

74
00:03:05.624 --> 00:03:07.494
- Really? - I didn't know that.

75
00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:08.725
- Was he also a basketball player? - Yes, he was.

76
00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:11.894
He messaged me saying that I should take care of her.

77
00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:15.105
Jang Hoon won't make fun of her then.

78
00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:18.674
I'm in a drama called, "Strongest Delivery Man".

79
00:03:18.674 --> 00:03:21.304
I played Ji Yoon in the drama.

80
00:03:21.304 --> 00:03:22.874
She was also a model of an airline.

81
00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:24.945
- That was so long ago. - I know.

82
00:03:25.045 --> 00:03:27.445
- She was a model of an airline. - I remember.

83
00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:29.744
- She was. - That's right.

84
00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:31.755
Did they pay you with mileage?

85
00:03:32.114 --> 00:03:33.955
(Gosh)

86
00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:37.755
I was going to help you, but it was such a bad joke.

87
00:03:37.755 --> 00:03:39.524
I should keep my mouth shut.

88
00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:40.695
Are you confident today?

89
00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:42.464
I should just be myself.

90
00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:45.494
He always looks so calm like that every week.

91
00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:48.864
There are some changes in their body languages when people lie.

92
00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:51.605
For example, people tend to raise their right eye.

93
00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:54.045
There has to be some changes in their body languages.

94
00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:57.844
- Can you even see properly? - What?

95
00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:00.144
He was sleeping earlier.

96
00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:02.244
He knows a lot of things about life.

97
00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:03.785
Jackson looks nervous.

98
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.355
I think he's a strong player in Master Key.

99
00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:09.084
As he's not good at speaking Korean, we won't be able to tell his lies.

100
00:04:09.084 --> 00:04:10.894
- Right. - I speak like a foreigner.

101
00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:12.394
Jackson can speak three different languages.

102
00:04:12.394 --> 00:04:13.455
(He's a smart idol singer as he can speak 3 languages.)

103
00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:15.594
- He was born in Gangwon Province. - He was.

104
00:04:15.594 --> 00:04:17.394
He was born in Gangneung, Gangwon Province.

105
00:04:17.695 --> 00:04:21.164
They are our mascots of Master Key. Kang Daniel and Ong Seong Wu.

106
00:04:21.164 --> 00:04:23.435
- Hello. - I'm Kang Daniel of Wanna One.

107
00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:24.834
Hello. I'm Ong Seong Wu of Wanna One.

108
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:26.104
Great.

109
00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:29.604
Please give some advice to these older players.

110
00:04:29.844 --> 00:04:31.575
- This game is so hard. - Is it?

111
00:04:31.575 --> 00:04:34.815
It's hard to make people to believe you when you're the Angel.

112
00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:35.914
(It's not easy to receive people's votes even when you're Angel.)

113
00:04:36.885 --> 00:04:39.015
I now understand why a lot of people love him,

114
00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:41.024
as I got to see him in person.

115
00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:42.654
- You're so random. - He is.

116
00:04:43.185 --> 00:04:45.024
- Are you trying to be his friend? - No.

117
00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:48.125
- You said it so randomly. - I was just sharing my feelings.

118
00:04:48.394 --> 00:04:50.565
In the waiting room, you said, "Only youngsters are in the show."

119
00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:52.635
Didn't you say that earlier?

120
00:04:53.534 --> 00:04:55.265
Please do not make things up.

121
00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:57.034
- Okay. I understand. - Stop bluffing.

122
00:04:57.675 --> 00:04:58.774
Gosh.

123
00:04:59.005 --> 00:05:00.474
Players.

124
00:05:00.974 --> 00:05:04.445
This is the Room of Fate where all the players can...

125
00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:07.214
find the real Master Keys.

126
00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:12.354
I will now explain the rules of Master Key.

127
00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:16.084
Please open the Judgment Cabinet in front of you.

128
00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.594
- Please open them. - All right.

129
00:05:17.594 --> 00:05:19.654
Among the 12 keys,

130
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:22.995
there are two keys that can open the prize box.

131
00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:26.464
One of the keys is Angel's Master key, and the other one is Demon's.

132
00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:30.404
You all have to find Angel's Master Key.

133
00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:32.875
And if you all manage to open the prize box,

134
00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:35.745
the prize will be multiplied by the number of the votes.

135
00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:37.945
The prize will be equally shared to every player who voted for Angel.

136
00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:39.815
Only when the players manage to find the Angel.

137
00:05:40.274 --> 00:05:42.644
Do we have to tell people that I am the Angel?

138
00:05:43.344 --> 00:05:46.115
If you really have Angel's Master Key, you have to persuade people.

139
00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:49.484
So we have to make people believe you if you're the Angel, right?

140
00:05:49.484 --> 00:05:50.995
- We can trick others too. - That's right.

141
00:05:51.094 --> 00:05:52.755
That's the fun part.

142
00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.325
If the players vote for Demon,

143
00:05:56.964 --> 00:05:59.094
the Demon will take the whole prize that is multiplied...

144
00:05:59.094 --> 00:06:00.565
by the number of votes.

145
00:06:01.164 --> 00:06:02.805
We should not vote for Demon.

146
00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.734
- The Demon will trick us. - Yes.

147
00:06:04.734 --> 00:06:06.404
So the Demon has to pretend like he doesn't know anything.

148
00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:08.044
- Do you all understand? - Yes.

149
00:06:08.175 --> 00:06:11.044
- If I am the Demon... - Trick people to vote for you...

150
00:06:11.044 --> 00:06:12.214
to win many votes.

151
00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:13.984
I want to be the Demon.

152
00:06:14.185 --> 00:06:15.885
It's not something you can choose.

153
00:06:15.885 --> 00:06:19.354
Why do you want to be the Demon when you're already so rich?

154
00:06:19.354 --> 00:06:20.425
I want to share the prize.

155
00:06:20.425 --> 00:06:21.955
Only Angel can share the prize.

156
00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:23.995
- The Demon can't. - That's right.

157
00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:28.195
If the players vote for a player...

158
00:06:28.195 --> 00:06:29.964
who doesn't have any Master Key,

159
00:06:30.164 --> 00:06:32.164
the person will take the whole prize...

160
00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.935
which is also increased by the number of votes.

161
00:06:35.065 --> 00:06:37.474
The person will take the whole prize.

162
00:06:37.474 --> 00:06:39.575
Do you all understand?

163
00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:43.445
People want different things.

164
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:46.075
It's not multiplied by the number of votes.

165
00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:48.115
The prize will be only increased by the number of votes.

166
00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:51.914
It seems like everyone has their own plans for today's game.

167
00:06:51.914 --> 00:06:53.584
No, I don't.

168
00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:59.755
It's time to find who has those Master Keys.

169
00:07:00.024 --> 00:07:03.024
The Judgment Cabinet will tell you.

170
00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:06.664
This is a very important time as we can see people's facial expression.

171
00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:09.635
(I will keep this face until the end.)

172
00:07:09.635 --> 00:07:11.305
No one will know who has the Master Keys.

173
00:07:12.075 --> 00:07:14.044
Is this key the Master Key?

174
00:07:17.815 --> 00:07:18.815
(He keeps the same face.)

175
00:07:18.815 --> 00:07:22.644
It's hard to read him as he keeps that same face all the time.

176
00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:24.315
I think he's the Angel inside.

177
00:07:24.414 --> 00:07:25.815
What are you saying?

178
00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:28.825
Did you all hear what he just said?

179
00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:30.185
- What is wrong with him? - Look at him.

180
00:07:30.185 --> 00:07:32.794
You used to not care about being close to idol singers.

181
00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:34.565
That's not it.

182
00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:36.094
Why can't I share my thoughts?

183
00:07:36.094 --> 00:07:38.034
I want to go home then.

184
00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:39.695
Bye then.

185
00:07:40.034 --> 00:07:41.164
Is this key...

186
00:07:42.664 --> 00:07:43.904
the Master Key?

187
00:07:48.844 --> 00:07:49.945
I knew it.

188
00:07:50.274 --> 00:07:52.344
I can tell you that...

189
00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:54.185
I have one of the Master Keys.

190
00:07:54.185 --> 00:07:56.784
- Can you all read him? - Yes.

191
00:07:56.784 --> 00:07:58.015
- Do you think he's the Angel? - No, he's not.

192
00:07:58.015 --> 00:07:59.714
(He's sure of his answer.)

193
00:08:00.955 --> 00:08:02.425
I think we all should try hard to guess.

194
00:08:02.425 --> 00:08:05.195
- We shouldn't vote for Demon. - It will be a disaster.

195
00:08:05.495 --> 00:08:07.664
- Is this key the Master Key? - Is this key the Master Key?

196
00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:09.964
I can't wait to see it.

197
00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:13.834
Can she be the Demon?

198
00:08:13.834 --> 00:08:15.834
I think Ji Min is the Demon.

199
00:08:15.935 --> 00:08:19.005
She has the black nail polish on.

200
00:08:19.005 --> 00:08:21.745
- You're scared of her dad. - No, I'm not.

201
00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:23.914
- What are you doing? - Her nails...

202
00:08:23.914 --> 00:08:26.615
He wants to support her that he talks about her nail polish.

203
00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:29.144
Is this key the Master Key?

204
00:08:33.484 --> 00:08:35.024
- Gosh. - "Gosh."

205
00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:37.754
- I can't read him. - It's not going to be fun this way.

206
00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:39.754
- His acting is so bad. - He's so bad at it.

207
00:08:40.094 --> 00:08:41.395
What is the good thing about being the Angel?

208
00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:42.994
Why do you ask when you're not the Angel?

209
00:08:43.224 --> 00:08:44.535
I mean, if I am the Angel...

210
00:08:45.464 --> 00:08:48.504
(Is he really the expert of mystery games?)

211
00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:50.264
"I mean, if I am the Angel..."

212
00:08:50.264 --> 00:08:52.275
I think he's just a passerby.

213
00:08:53.874 --> 00:08:55.874
- I think so too. - I am just asking.

214
00:08:55.874 --> 00:08:57.614
It is hard to make people believe me.

215
00:08:57.614 --> 00:08:59.775
Is this key the Master Key?

216
00:08:59.775 --> 00:09:02.145
Is this key the Master Key?

217
00:09:02.244 --> 00:09:04.185
Jackson is very smart.

218
00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:06.315
He keeps the same facial expression all the time.

219
00:09:07.525 --> 00:09:08.955
Can I tell people that I am the Demon?

220
00:09:08.955 --> 00:09:10.285
Are you satisfied with the result?

221
00:09:10.754 --> 00:09:11.994
I will just be myself.

222
00:09:12.724 --> 00:09:14.665
Is this key the Master Key?

223
00:09:14.864 --> 00:09:16.395
They are friends.

224
00:09:16.594 --> 00:09:19.165
- Are you the Angel? - You guys won't believe me now.

225
00:09:19.165 --> 00:09:20.504
Is that so?

226
00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:22.964
- Is this key... - Say it in cooler way.

227
00:09:23.504 --> 00:09:27.104
Is this key the Master Key?

228
00:09:27.244 --> 00:09:29.504
Is this key the Master Key?

229
00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:30.614
Look at Hyun Moo.

230
00:09:32.114 --> 00:09:33.214
What does this mean?

231
00:09:33.884 --> 00:09:35.685
- Look at him acting. - I am so surprised.

232
00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:38.014
- Stop it. - He's so bad at it.

233
00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:39.415
- Stop it. - I am just surprised.

234
00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:41.224
It will be a disaster if he's the Demon.

235
00:09:41.925 --> 00:09:43.525
Are you the Demon?

236
00:09:43.825 --> 00:09:45.254
I hate acting.

237
00:09:45.254 --> 00:09:46.955
This isn't good.

238
00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:49.925
You all have to vote for me today.

239
00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:51.864
Is this key the Master Key?

240
00:09:52.594 --> 00:09:55.565
Seong Wu and Jin Young keep the same faces.

241
00:09:57.205 --> 00:09:59.974
Did you all see him closing the cabinet quickly?

242
00:10:00.134 --> 00:10:02.775
He smiles with his eyes. He's so charming.

243
00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:04.175
- Don't feel awkward. - Gosh.

244
00:10:04.214 --> 00:10:06.114
He's charming. He's a sweet guy.

245
00:10:06.114 --> 00:10:07.785
- "He's a sweet guy." - "He's a sweet guy."

246
00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:09.645
- "He's a sweet guy." - Seong Wu is sweet.

247
00:10:09.645 --> 00:10:10.955
Seong Wu is a sweet guy.

248
00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:13.055
He's sweet like honey.

249
00:10:13.055 --> 00:10:14.224
(What is hiding behind his sweet smile?)

250
00:10:14.525 --> 00:10:18.525
Every player finished checking their keys.

251
00:10:18.695 --> 00:10:20.825
Every player should move to the locker room.

252
00:10:20.825 --> 00:10:21.895
The locker room.

253
00:10:21.895 --> 00:10:23.795
When the door opens, everyone can go to the locker room.

254
00:10:23.795 --> 00:10:25.435
Can't we talk freely...

255
00:10:25.435 --> 00:10:27.565
- and make people trust you? - There are cameras.

256
00:10:27.565 --> 00:10:30.065
There are cameras everywhere.

257
00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:32.205
So you have to keep telling people.

258
00:10:32.205 --> 00:10:34.045
It's fun. I've seen this show before.

259
00:10:34.045 --> 00:10:36.045
Where is the locker room? Do we go up there?

260
00:10:37.645 --> 00:10:39.374
This is bad.

261
00:10:40.714 --> 00:10:42.785
This is bad.

262
00:10:42.844 --> 00:10:43.984
You have to vote for me.

263
00:10:43.984 --> 00:10:45.214
I am the Angel.

264
00:10:45.214 --> 00:10:48.425
I hope you or Jang Hoon not to be the Demon.

265
00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:50.155
Because it will be harder for me.

266
00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:52.395
Seong Wu, are you not the Angel?

267
00:10:52.395 --> 00:10:54.065
I am the Angel.

268
00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:56.565
You are so you.

269
00:10:56.565 --> 00:10:59.195
He took a second to answer you.

270
00:10:59.734 --> 00:11:00.834
He's so funny.

271
00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:02.065
I really am the Angel.

272
00:11:02.065 --> 00:11:03.805
You are bad at lying too.

273
00:11:03.805 --> 00:11:05.935
I am about to go crazy. Because I am the Angel.

274
00:11:06.104 --> 00:11:08.974
I understand how Su Geun felt last week.

275
00:11:09.474 --> 00:11:11.614
- That's... - How do we...

276
00:11:11.614 --> 00:11:12.945
make Angel survive?

277
00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:15.785
- Are you acting now? - No.

278
00:11:16.014 --> 00:11:18.254
The way you ask people...

279
00:11:18.254 --> 00:11:19.685
make us think that you're not the Angel.

280
00:11:19.685 --> 00:11:21.685
- No. Let me tell you this. - He's not the Angel.

281
00:11:21.685 --> 00:11:25.224
He tricked others in the other show.

282
00:11:25.224 --> 00:11:26.494
He didn't get caught...

283
00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:28.425
- until the end. - Did he?

284
00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:31.035
- We played the mafia game. - He's good at the game.

285
00:11:31.035 --> 00:11:32.295
This game is also similar to the mafia game.

286
00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:34.464
He will pretend like he doesn't know anything.

287
00:11:34.464 --> 00:11:36.565
If you want to take as much as possible,

288
00:11:36.565 --> 00:11:38.234
you have to stand on Angel's side.

289
00:11:38.234 --> 00:11:39.234
That's right.

290
00:11:39.504 --> 00:11:40.874
JR isn't the Angel.

291
00:11:41.405 --> 00:11:42.905
He might be the Demon.

292
00:11:43.705 --> 00:11:45.175
We have to tell others.

293
00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:47.614
- But no one is believing me. - I'm actually...

294
00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:49.714
the Angel.

295
00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:53.254
Believe or not, I am the Angel.

296
00:11:53.514 --> 00:11:55.224
How do we make other people to believe me?

297
00:11:55.224 --> 00:11:57.925
Su Geun tried to tell people last time.

298
00:11:58.094 --> 00:11:59.395
I am the Angel.

299
00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:01.825
I am not lying this time.

300
00:12:01.864 --> 00:12:03.124
- Are you not lying this time? - Please,

301
00:12:03.124 --> 00:12:04.695
- believe me this time. - He said this last time too.

302
00:12:04.695 --> 00:12:06.195
But it turned out that he wasn't.

303
00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:07.864
I am not lying this time.

304
00:12:08.035 --> 00:12:09.405
- You are the Demon. - What?

305
00:12:09.405 --> 00:12:10.734
You are the Demon or you got an X.

306
00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:12.334
I didn't get an X.

307
00:12:12.435 --> 00:12:13.535
You are the demon then.

308
00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:15.974
Demon doesn't get X.

309
00:12:15.974 --> 00:12:17.374
No. Did you get an O then?

310
00:12:18.014 --> 00:12:19.874
Does O mean I am the Demon?

311
00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:21.045
No.

312
00:12:21.045 --> 00:12:22.685
(What is he saying?)

313
00:12:22.685 --> 00:12:24.754
They tell you on the screen whether you're the Angel or Demon.

314
00:12:25.014 --> 00:12:27.325
You are so scary.

315
00:12:27.325 --> 00:12:28.955
If you're acting now,

316
00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:31.594
you can win an award in acting.

317
00:12:31.994 --> 00:12:34.124
Everyone is taking a rest. I need to ask them something.

318
00:12:34.124 --> 00:12:37.864
(He meets up with the female players at the cafe.)

319
00:12:40.764 --> 00:12:42.805
As long as you two aren't the Demon, I am okay.

320
00:12:43.165 --> 00:12:45.374
- Are you the Angel? - Yes. I am.

321
00:12:45.374 --> 00:12:46.634
Are you the Angel?

322
00:12:46.874 --> 00:12:48.445
- Yes. - No. You are the Demon, right?

323
00:12:48.905 --> 00:12:50.675
- I am not. - I think you are the Demon.

324
00:12:50.775 --> 00:12:53.645
I am trying to tell you.

325
00:12:54.445 --> 00:12:55.744
I am the Angel.

326
00:12:56.244 --> 00:12:57.955
Stop it.

327
00:12:57.955 --> 00:12:59.185
- What is she doing? - I am telling you.

328
00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:00.455
I am telling you the truth.

329
00:13:00.455 --> 00:13:03.055
Gosh. She's driving me crazy.

330
00:13:03.055 --> 00:13:04.754
- I am telling you. - This won't work.

331
00:13:04.754 --> 00:13:06.354
- This won't work. - You shouldn't tell the others.

332
00:13:06.354 --> 00:13:08.864
I didn't expect her to be like this. I should go.

333
00:13:08.864 --> 00:13:10.764
- This isn't good. - Is he lying to us?

334
00:13:10.764 --> 00:13:12.165
They are lying to me.

335
00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:13.494
He's the Demon.

336
00:13:15.264 --> 00:13:16.264
He's the Demon.

337
00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:18.134
- He's the Demon. - I think so too.

338
00:13:18.535 --> 00:13:19.935
They're even worse.

339
00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:22.075
(Who is telling the truth?)

340
00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:23.915
It's impossible to talk to them.

341
00:13:23.915 --> 00:13:25.244
They're even worse.

342
00:13:25.244 --> 00:13:27.744
(Investigation Mission 1)

343
00:13:29.185 --> 00:13:31.655
(This place looks fun.)

344
00:13:31.655 --> 00:13:32.955
It's going to be painful.

345
00:13:33.254 --> 00:13:35.455
That thing kills people.

346
00:13:35.584 --> 00:13:37.325
Yes. It looks so painful.

347
00:13:37.325 --> 00:13:40.155
Why do they always bring the massaging pad in every variety show?

348
00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:43.224
I hate that thing.

349
00:13:43.425 --> 00:13:44.834
It's like needles.

350
00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:46.364
(It sure will help to circulate their blood.)

351
00:13:46.364 --> 00:13:48.665
- It's like needles. - It's going to hurt.

352
00:13:48.665 --> 00:13:50.705
I hate this massage board.

353
00:13:51.474 --> 00:13:53.134
I am not good at games which I need to use my body.

354
00:13:53.134 --> 00:13:55.104
I am better at psychological game.

355
00:13:55.104 --> 00:13:56.744
You were the worst one.

356
00:13:56.744 --> 00:13:58.315
I am not good at games which I need to use my body.

357
00:13:58.315 --> 00:14:00.514
- You're worse than me. - I am so bad at this kind of games.

358
00:14:00.514 --> 00:14:02.884
- Can I ask one question? - Yes.

359
00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.514
If the Angel...

360
00:14:04.884 --> 00:14:06.584
- You are not the Angel. - You are not the Angel.

361
00:14:06.584 --> 00:14:07.624
You are not the Angel.

362
00:14:07.624 --> 00:14:09.624
You don't need to worry about the Angel.

363
00:14:09.624 --> 00:14:11.555
- I need to ask this. - What are you doing?

364
00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:13.195
- Please. - I am so curious.

365
00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:15.224
He doesn't know anything about the game.

366
00:14:15.224 --> 00:14:17.594
Let's do the first game.

367
00:14:17.594 --> 00:14:21.665
A player who received the most votes from the viewers,

368
00:14:21.665 --> 00:14:23.705
he or she will receive a gold chance ticket.

369
00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:25.705
He or she will get a privilege.

370
00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:27.004
I think Jang Hoon received the most votes.

371
00:14:27.004 --> 00:14:29.344
He has so many fans...

372
00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:31.915
from when he was a basket player.

373
00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:33.045
They are much older now.

374
00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:34.145
I am sorry to interrupt.

375
00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:35.514
(He's speechless.)

376
00:14:35.514 --> 00:14:37.555
Please stop saying something like that.

377
00:14:38.514 --> 00:14:41.655
We have so many popular celebrities here.

378
00:14:41.655 --> 00:14:43.685
We have members of Super Junior and Wanna One.

379
00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:45.124
Of course.

380
00:14:45.695 --> 00:14:47.224
We also have a member of AOA.

381
00:14:47.224 --> 00:14:49.724
AOA and NU'EST.

382
00:14:49.895 --> 00:14:51.094
They are top idol singers.

383
00:14:51.094 --> 00:14:54.234
Who is the player who received the most votes?

384
00:14:54.234 --> 00:15:01.844
(Who received the most votes from the viewers?)

385
00:15:02.575 --> 00:15:03.874
Kang Daniel.

386
00:15:03.874 --> 00:15:06.275
(Daniel won 2 weeks in a row.)

387
00:15:07.285 --> 00:15:12.514
(He received the most votes from the viewers 2 weeks in a row.)

388
00:15:13.785 --> 00:15:15.584
This is so mean.

389
00:15:15.754 --> 00:15:17.724
I always say this. The last player must get the ticket too.

390
00:15:17.724 --> 00:15:19.155
It's unfair because only the first one gets the privilege.

391
00:15:19.155 --> 00:15:20.795
Then you'll always get the ticket, Hyun Moo.

392
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:22.994
Only the same person gets the ticket all the time.

393
00:15:24.435 --> 00:15:27.334
"You received two votes."

394
00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:28.834
(He received 2 votes.)

395
00:15:28.834 --> 00:15:31.035
Daniel can use two votes.

396
00:15:31.035 --> 00:15:33.075
He won last week with this golden ticket.

397
00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:35.075
- He's a great guy. - I'm so jealous.

398
00:15:35.075 --> 00:15:36.575
He's a young and fantastic guy.

399
00:15:36.575 --> 00:15:38.744
I respect him so much.

400
00:15:39.275 --> 00:15:43.714
(One vote can turn the table around.)

401
00:15:43.714 --> 00:15:45.354
(Whoever gets Daniel's 2 votes...)

402
00:15:45.354 --> 00:15:48.055
(will survive in this war.)

403
00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:49.484
(However, no one knows...)

404
00:15:49.484 --> 00:15:52.994
(which Master Key Daniel has.)

405
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.065
(Is there a fried chicken place?)

406
00:15:56.025 --> 00:16:00.334
(Who will get Daniel's votes?)

407
00:16:02.065 --> 00:16:03.435
Let's start the first game.

408
00:16:03.435 --> 00:16:05.435
Human Goalpost Basketball.

409
00:16:06.004 --> 00:16:07.604
One player from each team becomes the goalpost.

410
00:16:07.604 --> 00:16:10.145
2 players play the game. It's a 3-to-3 game.

411
00:16:10.445 --> 00:16:13.514
The goalposts will be attached on their backs.

412
00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:15.415
You guys can run around.

413
00:16:15.645 --> 00:16:16.945
But we have to play the game on this massage board.

414
00:16:17.655 --> 00:16:19.254
It hurts to even stand on it.

415
00:16:19.584 --> 00:16:21.825
Everyone gets to play.

416
00:16:22.624 --> 00:16:24.254
It hurts.

417
00:16:24.254 --> 00:16:26.155
- It hurts. - He looks fine.

418
00:16:26.155 --> 00:16:28.895
- It does hurt. - You should run around then.

419
00:16:29.124 --> 00:16:30.195
Walk slowly.

420
00:16:30.195 --> 00:16:32.435
I can't do this.

421
00:16:32.435 --> 00:16:33.834
It hurts so much.

422
00:16:33.834 --> 00:16:35.464
(Massaging your feet makes you healthy.)

423
00:16:37.334 --> 00:16:39.705
How are we going to play the game? It hurts to even stand on this.

424
00:16:39.705 --> 00:16:42.104
(How are we going to play basketball?)

425
00:16:43.844 --> 00:16:44.945
(Why are you guys so weak?)

426
00:16:44.945 --> 00:16:46.575
This is hurts so much.

427
00:16:46.645 --> 00:16:47.645
Where do you want to stand?

428
00:16:47.645 --> 00:16:49.614
- I will be the goalpost. - Okay.

429
00:16:49.614 --> 00:16:51.655
- You have to run around then. - He can be the goalpost.

430
00:16:51.655 --> 00:16:53.214
Put this on.

431
00:16:53.455 --> 00:16:54.984
Hee Chul can be the goalpost and I will try to score.

432
00:16:54.984 --> 00:16:56.254
(Hee Chul is the goalpost in Jang Hoon's team.)

433
00:16:56.254 --> 00:16:57.455
It's better for me to throw the balls.

434
00:16:57.455 --> 00:16:58.695
Great.

435
00:16:59.254 --> 00:17:01.124
I haven't done something like this before.

436
00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:04.435
I will try to dodge every ball.

437
00:17:04.435 --> 00:17:05.695
Don't you feel the pain?

438
00:17:05.695 --> 00:17:07.205
I will try my best to protect it.

439
00:17:07.205 --> 00:17:09.135
You guys should know...

440
00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:10.335
that I am the Angel.

441
00:17:11.274 --> 00:17:12.405
He's not the Angel.

442
00:17:12.405 --> 00:17:14.145
- I am... - You are so random.

443
00:17:14.145 --> 00:17:16.345
You guys should believe me...

444
00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:18.744
as I am trying so hard.

445
00:17:19.115 --> 00:17:21.345
(As the game starts, unhealthy people show up.)

446
00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:22.345
Does anyone have that thing?

447
00:17:23.784 --> 00:17:26.814
(It's even hard to stand on it.)

448
00:17:26.814 --> 00:17:28.254
- Gosh. - It hurts.

449
00:17:28.655 --> 00:17:30.125
It hurts so much.

450
00:17:30.355 --> 00:17:32.294
I must have bad health.

451
00:17:33.355 --> 00:17:34.865
(Everyone's in the same boat.)

452
00:17:34.865 --> 00:17:36.494
Everyone starts screaming.

453
00:17:36.595 --> 00:17:37.964
Hurry up.

454
00:17:38.294 --> 00:17:41.004
For the first round, I, JR,

455
00:17:41.004 --> 00:17:44.405
and Hee Chul will play first.

456
00:17:44.405 --> 00:17:48.544
For us, Sang Min, Jackson, and Seong Wu will play first.

457
00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:51.014
Where do we start then? Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

458
00:17:51.014 --> 00:17:52.544
Jump ball.

459
00:17:52.544 --> 00:17:54.345
We can't do the jump ball on this thing.

460
00:17:54.345 --> 00:17:55.814
(It will be their last day if they do the jump ball.)

461
00:17:56.345 --> 00:17:57.885
We won't do that today.

462
00:17:58.615 --> 00:17:59.685
Do the jump ball.

463
00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:01.824
- Do I jump? - Shall I jump?

464
00:18:01.824 --> 00:18:03.585
(They decide to do the jump ball.)

465
00:18:04.155 --> 00:18:06.324
- I can't do this. - Okay. Let's start.

466
00:18:06.324 --> 00:18:08.425
- It hurts so much. - Here we go.

467
00:18:08.865 --> 00:18:10.534
This is the first five minutes of the first round.

468
00:18:10.534 --> 00:18:12.494
Hold on. Hyun Moo.

469
00:18:12.494 --> 00:18:15.135
I don't play basketball...

470
00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:17.534
on variety shows. But...

471
00:18:18.304 --> 00:18:20.705
(Are you having an interview?)

472
00:18:20.705 --> 00:18:22.744
I don't usually do this.

473
00:18:22.744 --> 00:18:24.145
I don't usually do this.

474
00:18:24.415 --> 00:18:27.585
We have to win in order to...

475
00:18:27.585 --> 00:18:29.544
- receive... - Let's just start the game now.

476
00:18:29.544 --> 00:18:31.585
- We have to win. - It hurts so much.

477
00:18:31.585 --> 00:18:34.125
(Jang Hoon keeps talking.)

478
00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:35.455
No.

479
00:18:35.455 --> 00:18:38.254
It feels very humiliating...

480
00:18:38.254 --> 00:18:40.464
to play basketball on a variety show.

481
00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:42.165
It is very rare to see Jang Hoon...

482
00:18:42.165 --> 00:18:44.095
- playing basketball on a show. - It is.

483
00:18:44.095 --> 00:18:45.695
- Let's start. - Get ready.

484
00:18:45.695 --> 00:18:46.895
(We heard your story very well. Let's start already.)

485
00:18:46.895 --> 00:18:48.135
(The first half begins.)

486
00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:49.635
Good.

487
00:18:50.405 --> 00:18:51.734
(He caught the ball.)

488
00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:54.504
- Catch him. - What's he doing?

489
00:18:54.504 --> 00:18:56.244
- Hold on. - Why are you stopping the game?

490
00:18:56.244 --> 00:18:58.615
- What's wrong? - If he was doing the jump ball,

491
00:18:58.615 --> 00:19:00.685
he was supposed to hit the ball not run with the ball.

492
00:19:00.685 --> 00:19:02.814
We just do things like this on variety shows.

493
00:19:02.814 --> 00:19:04.014
- This is a variety show. - Do it again.

494
00:19:04.014 --> 00:19:05.955
Then why did you guys even jump?

495
00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:07.455
You were supposed to hit the ball.

496
00:19:07.455 --> 00:19:08.885
Jump ball.

497
00:19:09.054 --> 00:19:11.224
(He teaches them about the jump ball.)

498
00:19:11.224 --> 00:19:12.494
I was surprised as well.

499
00:19:12.494 --> 00:19:13.764
- It hurts so much when I jump. - You were supposed to hit the ball.

500
00:19:13.764 --> 00:19:15.365
- Do I hit the ball then? - Do you know how to play the game?

501
00:19:15.365 --> 00:19:16.365
You have to hit the ball to the other side first.

502
00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:17.365
This is a variety show.

503
00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:19.064
I understand that this is a variety show.

504
00:19:19.064 --> 00:19:21.105
- You were supposed to know it. - We don't know it well.

505
00:19:21.105 --> 00:19:22.534
Ready.

506
00:19:23.635 --> 00:19:25.574
Let's go.

507
00:19:27.304 --> 00:19:29.905
(He managed to hit the ball this time.)

508
00:19:29.905 --> 00:19:31.845
Hold on. I think I hurt the ankle.

509
00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:33.814
(You can't just stop the game like that.)

510
00:19:33.814 --> 00:19:35.885
It began. You can't do that.

511
00:19:35.885 --> 00:19:37.284
Go. Run.

512
00:19:37.284 --> 00:19:38.714
Just run.

513
00:19:38.714 --> 00:19:40.984
You don't need to dribble the ball.

514
00:19:40.984 --> 00:19:42.054
Don't we need to dribble the ball?

515
00:19:43.355 --> 00:19:44.824
Okay. Pass the ball.

516
00:19:45.224 --> 00:19:46.754
You can try me.

517
00:19:46.754 --> 00:19:48.625
(You can come and attack me.)

518
00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:50.494
What are you doing?

519
00:19:50.665 --> 00:19:54.665
(It will be the last round.)

520
00:19:56.764 --> 00:19:58.435
(It's fun to watch.)

521
00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:00.645
Why is it so crowded there?

522
00:20:00.675 --> 00:20:03.074
(Jang Hoon passes the ball to Hee Chul.)

523
00:20:03.105 --> 00:20:04.314
(He rushes to the ball.)

524
00:20:05.574 --> 00:20:06.615
Wait.

525
00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:09.244
(This is my chance to take a shot.)

526
00:20:09.345 --> 00:20:10.514
You can't dunk it in my hoop.

527
00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:13.415
(He got the wrong hoop.)

528
00:20:14.125 --> 00:20:15.355
(We are playing basketball, right?)

529
00:20:15.355 --> 00:20:16.554
Go to the other hoop!

530
00:20:16.554 --> 00:20:17.794
You can't put it in my hoop.

531
00:20:18.395 --> 00:20:19.895
(He passes to Seong Wu who has no clue about the game.)

532
00:20:19.895 --> 00:20:21.064
- You need to make the shot. - All right.

533
00:20:21.294 --> 00:20:22.494
Hey, you need to get it in.

534
00:20:23.895 --> 00:20:25.335
(This is the blocking...)

535
00:20:25.335 --> 00:20:26.534
(of Korea's best basketball player.)

536
00:20:27.105 --> 00:20:28.264
Get it in the hoop.

537
00:20:28.264 --> 00:20:29.304
(Bring back the 1997.)

538
00:20:29.304 --> 00:20:30.534
Get it in!

539
00:20:31.274 --> 00:20:32.274
Pass it to him.

540
00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:33.274
(The blocking didn't last long.)

541
00:20:34.175 --> 00:20:36.905
(His teammate makes an alley-oop pass,)

542
00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:38.645
(and Jackson makes an alley-oop dunk.)

543
00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:40.915
(Jackson has scored 1 point so far.)

544
00:20:40.915 --> 00:20:42.544
(The score is 0 to 1, and Team Hyun Moo is leading.)

545
00:20:43.754 --> 00:20:45.115
Jackson, that was great.

546
00:20:45.115 --> 00:20:46.355
- That looked so cool. - Hey.

547
00:20:46.355 --> 00:20:47.855
He dunked it.

548
00:20:47.855 --> 00:20:49.054
Jackson, that was great.

549
00:20:49.524 --> 00:20:50.655
- Score a lot of points. - With this arm...

550
00:20:50.655 --> 00:20:51.655
(I'll get started, guys.)

551
00:20:52.024 --> 00:20:53.095
- All right. - Let's go.

552
00:20:53.095 --> 00:20:54.165
Hey, block him well.

553
00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:56.195
I can't believe I'm doing this with these jokers.

554
00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.395
(He passes the ball straight rather indifferently.)

555
00:20:59.494 --> 00:21:00.865
My gosh.

556
00:21:00.964 --> 00:21:02.504
What's happening? Is pulling allowed?

557
00:21:02.504 --> 00:21:06.405
(There are some things my instincts notice despite my sentiment.)

558
00:21:06.804 --> 00:21:09.974
(It's the weakness of the opposing team.)

559
00:21:09.974 --> 00:21:12.314
(Oh, no. We just made eye contact.)

560
00:21:13.574 --> 00:21:16.484
(There's no point of you guys playing.)

561
00:21:18.115 --> 00:21:20.455
- Jackson, what are you doing? - Hey, pass it to me. Hurry.

562
00:21:22.754 --> 00:21:25.324
(It's their chance to turn the table around.)

563
00:21:25.455 --> 00:21:27.595
(Who is he? He's scaring me.)

564
00:21:27.724 --> 00:21:29.365
(Will he be able to bring...)

565
00:21:29.365 --> 00:21:31.635
(back the glory of the old days?)

566
00:21:31.635 --> 00:21:33.264
(See you later!)

567
00:21:34.764 --> 00:21:36.464
(Catch me if you can!)

568
00:21:36.464 --> 00:21:38.034
Seriously? How can he run so fast?

569
00:21:38.034 --> 00:21:39.105
(Running restores his youth.)

570
00:21:39.105 --> 00:21:40.304
Hey, let me have it. JR!

571
00:21:40.744 --> 00:21:41.804
My gosh, he's good.

572
00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:44.145
- Hurry. Where are you shooting at? - Get it in that hoop!

573
00:21:44.145 --> 00:21:46.115
(In the midst of this, he still confuses the hoops.)

574
00:21:46.845 --> 00:21:48.115
(Seong Wu gets the ball again.)

575
00:21:48.115 --> 00:21:50.044
- What are you doing? - Shoot! Make the shot!

576
00:21:50.514 --> 00:21:52.014
Jump and shoot!

577
00:21:53.284 --> 00:21:54.855
(After distracting the opponents...)

578
00:21:54.855 --> 00:21:55.855
Shoot!

579
00:21:55.855 --> 00:21:57.425
(He tries to dunk the ball.)

580
00:21:57.595 --> 00:21:59.125
(Don't you dare try...)

581
00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:00.324
(your funny business here.)

582
00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:03.895
(That's not how you play basketball.)

583
00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:08.835
(JR gets a lucky break and scores a point.)

584
00:22:10.905 --> 00:22:12.835
(JR has scored 1 point so far.)

585
00:22:12.835 --> 00:22:14.044
- Hold on. - What?

586
00:22:14.044 --> 00:22:16.474
You were holding the hoop.

587
00:22:16.845 --> 00:22:18.274
(Good job on holding the hoop and acting fast.)

588
00:22:18.445 --> 00:22:19.574
That hurts so much.

589
00:22:19.574 --> 00:22:20.885
All right.

590
00:22:20.885 --> 00:22:23.115
- We need to score 1 point. - 2 minutes and 30 seconds passed.

591
00:22:23.115 --> 00:22:24.885
- What? - Only 2 minutes and 30 second?

592
00:22:24.885 --> 00:22:26.254
Only 2 minutes and 30 seconds passed.

593
00:22:26.254 --> 00:22:28.054
- We need to stop him, JR. - Come to this side.

594
00:22:28.524 --> 00:22:31.095
- Jackson, we need another point. - Hey, hurry and make a shot.

595
00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:33.655
- Jang Hoon should've had the hoop. - Why are you going there?

596
00:22:34.264 --> 00:22:35.865
- Hey. - Hold on a minute.

597
00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:38.195
- I think my feet are bleeding. - You can just try it there.

598
00:22:38.234 --> 00:22:40.335
Who is he? Do we have a new yoga teacher?

599
00:22:40.804 --> 00:22:41.964
(What?)

600
00:22:42.405 --> 00:22:44.034
- Your back looks sexy. - Right.

601
00:22:44.034 --> 00:22:46.274
Instructor, are we learning the cat pose?

602
00:22:47.105 --> 00:22:48.105
(Welcome to Seong Wu's Pilates class.)

603
00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:50.145
He's a new Pilates teacher.

604
00:22:50.445 --> 00:22:52.544
(I can definitely relate to his pain.)

605
00:22:53.415 --> 00:22:54.984
- JR, I want you to stay over there. - Pass it to me.

606
00:22:54.984 --> 00:22:56.284
(Team Hyun Moo plays offense.)

607
00:22:57.214 --> 00:22:58.314
Stay next to the hoop.

608
00:22:59.385 --> 00:23:00.724
Don't use your strength.

609
00:23:00.724 --> 00:23:01.784
- Come on, you're a man. - Make the shot.

610
00:23:01.784 --> 00:23:02.824
(Let me handle the defense.)

611
00:23:02.885 --> 00:23:05.355
- Let me try this. - When you steal my heart

612
00:23:05.355 --> 00:23:08.695
(He blocks the players and the hoop.)

613
00:23:08.764 --> 00:23:10.964
(Hee Chul tries to hide behind Jang Hoon.)

614
00:23:10.964 --> 00:23:12.165
Don't do it! No!

615
00:23:12.964 --> 00:23:14.004
(He fails to score.)

616
00:23:15.034 --> 00:23:16.504
He's right behind you! Right behind you!

617
00:23:16.504 --> 00:23:17.875
(The acupressure mat pokes their feet again.)

618
00:23:17.875 --> 00:23:19.705
- You got it. Go! Run! - Seriously?

619
00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:22.205
(He has a chance to score with the help of Jang Hoon's play.)

620
00:23:22.205 --> 00:23:24.314
(This is a chance to score 1 on 1.)

621
00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:26.514
(You must...)

622
00:23:26.514 --> 00:23:29.145
(score no matter what.)

623
00:23:31.254 --> 00:23:33.115
(Did he try to dunk?)

624
00:23:33.115 --> 00:23:34.185
(He must be dreaming.)

625
00:23:35.185 --> 00:23:38.524
(He crumbles down like a falling leaf.)

626
00:23:38.994 --> 00:23:40.095
That must have hurt your bottom.

627
00:23:41.395 --> 00:23:43.095
- We got it. That's it! - Nice.

628
00:23:43.095 --> 00:23:44.935
(Team Hyun Moo counterattacks.)

629
00:23:44.935 --> 00:23:46.195
No, please don't. I love you, Jackson.

630
00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:47.534
What is he saying?

631
00:23:47.534 --> 00:23:48.835
(Hee Chul,)

632
00:23:48.835 --> 00:23:50.705
(I'm on my way.)

633
00:23:51.935 --> 00:23:53.405
What are you doing?

634
00:23:53.405 --> 00:23:54.574
Watch your back.

635
00:23:54.574 --> 00:23:55.605
(He gets the ball from Hee Chul.)

636
00:23:55.605 --> 00:23:56.744
What was that, Jackson?

637
00:23:56.744 --> 00:23:58.044
(This enthusiastic player heads to...)

638
00:23:58.445 --> 00:24:01.685
No! He's right behind you! Right behind you!

639
00:24:02.445 --> 00:24:03.445
(Tugging)

640
00:24:04.685 --> 00:24:05.754
(I can see the hoop now.)

641
00:24:05.754 --> 00:24:07.885
My goodness. Unbelievable!

642
00:24:08.784 --> 00:24:11.324
(He runs to rejuvenate his youth for the 2nd time.)

643
00:24:11.324 --> 00:24:12.794
(He passes to Jang Hoon to target Sang Min.)

644
00:24:13.625 --> 00:24:15.224
I can't believe this.

645
00:24:15.224 --> 00:24:17.095
My goodness.

646
00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:18.935
Jang Hoon, make the shot.

647
00:24:18.994 --> 00:24:20.135
He's acting weird.

648
00:24:21.004 --> 00:24:22.365
- Be careful. - Dunk it!

649
00:24:22.365 --> 00:24:23.365
(He passes it back to JR.)

650
00:24:23.365 --> 00:24:25.304
(Sang Min runs to restore his youth for the 3rd time.)

651
00:24:27.074 --> 00:24:28.845
(Where are you going, Sang Min?)

652
00:24:29.675 --> 00:24:31.445
(Gosh, he's persistent.)

653
00:24:32.915 --> 00:24:33.984
Come here, hoop!

654
00:24:34.544 --> 00:24:35.814
(Sang Min, if you run away,)

655
00:24:35.814 --> 00:24:38.085
(it's going to be hard for both of us.)

656
00:24:38.314 --> 00:24:40.314
(JR has scored 2 points so far.)

657
00:24:40.314 --> 00:24:42.024
- Are you serious? - You can't do that.

658
00:24:42.024 --> 00:24:43.054
He got it in.

659
00:24:43.224 --> 00:24:44.494
He's beat.

660
00:24:45.125 --> 00:24:46.155
He got it in.

661
00:24:47.425 --> 00:24:48.425
Hey.

662
00:24:49.095 --> 00:24:52.494
- Collapse after you repay the debt. - He got it in.

663
00:24:52.494 --> 00:24:53.494
(You'll shock the creditors.)

664
00:24:53.695 --> 00:24:55.205
How many minutes do we have?

665
00:24:55.564 --> 00:24:57.074
Jackson, we must win.

666
00:24:57.734 --> 00:24:59.205
We won't be able to score any points in the second half.

667
00:24:59.804 --> 00:25:02.375
- Let's start from the other side. - We're in trouble.

668
00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:03.504
We won't be able to score any.

669
00:25:03.504 --> 00:25:05.044
We must get our victory in the first half.

670
00:25:05.044 --> 00:25:07.314
- Eun Hyuk and I can't do anything. - I'm sorry for that.

671
00:25:07.314 --> 00:25:09.185
What's wrong with him?

672
00:25:09.885 --> 00:25:11.554
That doesn't matter in basketball.

673
00:25:12.754 --> 00:25:14.925
- Be careful. - You're playing basketball.

674
00:25:14.925 --> 00:25:16.385
- Isn't that a sport? - It hurts.

675
00:25:16.984 --> 00:25:19.655
- Let's go. - Let's just grab them.

676
00:25:19.655 --> 00:25:21.125
- Everyone should grab one. - Okay.

677
00:25:21.264 --> 00:25:22.724
- We're doomed. - Yes, we won.

678
00:25:22.724 --> 00:25:24.534
- No, no. We'll win. - This is our win.

679
00:25:24.534 --> 00:25:26.195
- I can't do anything. - Jackson.

680
00:25:26.195 --> 00:25:27.304
Good luck.

681
00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:29.034
- Start. - We don't have much time left.

682
00:25:29.034 --> 00:25:31.034
(He passes the ball and runs at full speed.)

683
00:25:31.804 --> 00:25:33.004
(Jackson is known for his speed.)

684
00:25:33.004 --> 00:25:34.105
Hey, hey! Pass it over there.

685
00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:35.945
(I'm going to score a point too!)

686
00:25:35.945 --> 00:25:37.544
- All right. - Stop him.

687
00:25:37.544 --> 00:25:38.544
(Let's stall time.)

688
00:25:38.544 --> 00:25:39.615
- Grab him. - Stop him.

689
00:25:40.314 --> 00:25:41.345
Right here.

690
00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:43.915
(This is how amateurs play basketball.)

691
00:25:43.955 --> 00:25:45.415
Run, run, run!

692
00:25:45.655 --> 00:25:48.125
(Meanwhile, Jackson gets the ball.)

693
00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:49.125
Jackson, run!

694
00:25:49.385 --> 00:25:51.324
(He grits his teeth...)

695
00:25:51.324 --> 00:25:53.395
(and does his best to score a point.)

696
00:25:54.365 --> 00:25:56.425
(Can he penetrate Jang Hoon's ironclad defense...)

697
00:25:56.425 --> 00:25:58.665
(and earn a point to make the score even?)

698
00:25:58.665 --> 00:26:00.435
(Please make the game tied.)

699
00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:03.135
(No way. Can it be tied?)

700
00:26:04.205 --> 00:26:05.274
(He manages to score a point.)

701
00:26:06.574 --> 00:26:07.574
(Jackson has scored 2 points so far.)

702
00:26:07.574 --> 00:26:09.175
- Jackson! - Yes!

703
00:26:09.504 --> 00:26:10.544
Well done.

704
00:26:10.875 --> 00:26:12.244
- It went in. - Why aren't you on the mat?

705
00:26:12.314 --> 00:26:13.645
- We can't do that. - Hey.

706
00:26:13.645 --> 00:26:15.145
- Come here. - That was great.

707
00:26:15.145 --> 00:26:16.445
- Go away. - Hey!

708
00:26:16.615 --> 00:26:17.784
Gosh, it hurts!

709
00:26:18.714 --> 00:26:19.885
(Seong Wu is ready to end it.)

710
00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:21.024
I understand your posture now.

711
00:26:21.024 --> 00:26:22.554
Didn't we run out of time...

712
00:26:22.554 --> 00:26:23.754
- before he scored it? - I thought...

713
00:26:23.754 --> 00:26:25.125
- Didn't it end before his shot? - No.

714
00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.195
- It ended after the shot. - No.

715
00:26:26.195 --> 00:26:28.064
- Don't you know a buzzer beater? - He counted the seconds.

716
00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:29.224
Don't you know a buzzer beater?

717
00:26:29.264 --> 00:26:31.494
Excuse me, there's no such thing for this kind of game.

718
00:26:31.494 --> 00:26:33.034
- Of course there is. - No way.

719
00:26:33.034 --> 00:26:34.734
- Did you see that? - Seriously.

720
00:26:34.734 --> 00:26:36.405
(The first half ends with the score of 2 to 2.)

721
00:26:36.405 --> 00:26:37.935
- Congratulations. - That was perfect.

722
00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:39.804
- That was a buzzer beater. - That was perfect. Great.

723
00:26:40.274 --> 00:26:42.244
- We're going to change now. - This is so hard.

724
00:26:42.274 --> 00:26:44.274
This game is really hard,

725
00:26:44.274 --> 00:26:46.474
so prepare yourselves before playing. I mean every word of it.

726
00:26:46.474 --> 00:26:48.484
(Hyun Moo, Eun Hyuk, and Won Hee)

727
00:26:48.484 --> 00:26:52.155
(The trio of weaklings of Team Hyun Moo sets out to play.)

728
00:26:53.284 --> 00:26:55.284
Shoot. Hey.

729
00:26:55.284 --> 00:26:56.784
- I can't even move an inch. - Wait.

730
00:26:56.855 --> 00:26:58.195
- Eun Hyuk. - Yes?

731
00:26:58.195 --> 00:26:59.724
- We only need 1 point. - 1 point?

732
00:26:59.724 --> 00:27:01.294
- I'll do a good job running away. - Just 1 point?

733
00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:06.034
(These 2 players, Jin Young and Ji Min, don't raise concern at all,)

734
00:27:06.034 --> 00:27:07.105
(but this guy raises some concern.)

735
00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:08.534
Daniel should be the hoop.

736
00:27:10.064 --> 00:27:11.135
The hoop?

737
00:27:13.405 --> 00:27:16.774
(Make no mistake. This isn't on slow motion.)

738
00:27:17.074 --> 00:27:19.375
(The more he steps on the mat,)

739
00:27:19.375 --> 00:27:21.714
(the more of his memory on the day comes back.)

740
00:27:22.585 --> 00:27:24.054
(Hyun Moo's patience runs low.)

741
00:27:24.054 --> 00:27:26.115
- I don't think I can do this. - It's the other way around.

742
00:27:26.585 --> 00:27:28.885
- Aren't I good? - Daniel can't walk on the mat.

743
00:27:28.885 --> 00:27:29.925
- My gosh. - So he should be the hoop.

744
00:27:29.925 --> 00:27:32.195
It hurts because you work too much. You're not healthy.

745
00:27:32.195 --> 00:27:34.494
(This is a present for you since you're so busy these days.)

746
00:27:39.064 --> 00:27:40.135
I'm sorry.

747
00:27:40.435 --> 00:27:43.105
- I keep hearing the goalie sigh. - This is too hard.

748
00:27:43.635 --> 00:27:44.974
(I can do this.)

749
00:27:44.974 --> 00:27:47.405
- What's that sound? - Get ready. We're starting soon.

750
00:27:47.405 --> 00:27:48.945
- But this is... - Make sure you jump.

751
00:27:48.974 --> 00:27:50.514
Get ready.

752
00:27:50.514 --> 00:27:51.875
(It'd be disappointing without the jump ball.)

753
00:27:51.875 --> 00:27:52.945
Jump.

754
00:27:53.074 --> 00:27:54.185
- Hurry. - Hey.

755
00:27:55.284 --> 00:27:57.155
(Both players touch the ball at the same time.)

756
00:27:58.514 --> 00:27:59.514
Let's do it again.

757
00:27:59.514 --> 00:28:00.855
(It was a foul.)

758
00:28:00.855 --> 00:28:02.455
- Let's do it again. - Hey, Eun Hyuk.

759
00:28:02.484 --> 00:28:03.484
You can do this.

760
00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:04.554
(My back is on fire!)

761
00:28:04.794 --> 00:28:05.925
Eun Hyuk.

762
00:28:06.655 --> 00:28:07.724
(Are you serious?)

763
00:28:07.724 --> 00:28:09.064
- Let's do it again. - Eun Hyuk.

764
00:28:09.064 --> 00:28:10.994
Jang Hoon, Eun Hyuk had the best jump ball.

765
00:28:10.994 --> 00:28:13.395
Both players touched the ball at the same time.

766
00:28:13.395 --> 00:28:15.705
We must do it again. Again.

767
00:28:16.435 --> 00:28:18.435
Get ready. 1, 2...

768
00:28:18.435 --> 00:28:19.734
(Doing the jump ball twice brings more fun.)

769
00:28:19.974 --> 00:28:21.205
There you go!

770
00:28:21.974 --> 00:28:23.074
- Eun Hyuk. - Is this our ball?

771
00:28:23.474 --> 00:28:24.744
Won Hee is doing good.

772
00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:27.345
(Out of many choices she can make, she decides to...)

773
00:28:27.345 --> 00:28:28.415
We need to put it in that hoop?

774
00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:29.415
(After she checks her target,)

775
00:28:30.514 --> 00:28:33.085
(she runs at the speed of light.)

776
00:28:33.655 --> 00:28:35.885
(The bulldozer of the acupressure mat reveals herself.)

777
00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:37.925
(What is happening?)

778
00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:40.224
(She's scary!)

779
00:28:40.395 --> 00:28:43.294
(This is why Hyun Moo only scored 79 points on his abilities.)

780
00:28:44.695 --> 00:28:46.534
(In no time, she moves to the other side.)

781
00:28:46.534 --> 00:28:48.004
(She manages to make a killing pass.)

782
00:28:49.504 --> 00:28:52.804
(I got you!)

783
00:28:54.345 --> 00:28:56.945
(Jin Young has scored 1 point so far.)

784
00:28:57.574 --> 00:29:01.514
(Team Jang Hoon moves fast, endures pain well, and has good physiques.)

785
00:29:02.185 --> 00:29:05.754
I knew it. Her father was a former basketball player.

786
00:29:05.814 --> 00:29:06.855
(A basketball player's daughter)

787
00:29:06.855 --> 00:29:08.024
She's a descendant of a basketball player.

788
00:29:08.484 --> 00:29:10.284
- She really is. - Wait.

789
00:29:10.284 --> 00:29:11.455
She's very athletic.

790
00:29:11.455 --> 00:29:12.895
It's not that. Her feet can't feel pain. That's all.

791
00:29:12.895 --> 00:29:14.224
No, she really is a descendant of a basketball player.

792
00:29:14.294 --> 00:29:16.165
She's good. My team is the best.

793
00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:17.365
Go, Team Jang Hoon!

794
00:29:17.764 --> 00:29:18.835
Eun Hyuk.

795
00:29:18.835 --> 00:29:19.895
(Team Hyun Moo plays offense.)

796
00:29:19.895 --> 00:29:21.405
- Just score 1 point. - We need to 1 point.

797
00:29:21.464 --> 00:29:22.534
- I'm sorry. - Eun Hyuk.

798
00:29:23.034 --> 00:29:24.234
- Won Hee. - Don't let them take the ball.

799
00:29:24.435 --> 00:29:25.534
Won Hee is doing everything.

800
00:29:25.534 --> 00:29:26.534
(She must've been frustrated.)

801
00:29:26.534 --> 00:29:28.244
(She does a trick play...)

802
00:29:28.244 --> 00:29:30.004
(and runs at full speed.)

803
00:29:31.915 --> 00:29:33.714
(At last,)

804
00:29:33.714 --> 00:29:35.085
(it's time for the pain.)

805
00:29:35.085 --> 00:29:36.244
Eun Hyuk.

806
00:29:37.855 --> 00:29:38.984
- Block her. - Here!

807
00:29:38.984 --> 00:29:40.455
There you go! Come on!

808
00:29:40.685 --> 00:29:41.925
Eun Hyuk, come on.

809
00:29:42.554 --> 00:29:44.054
(Are you a branch?)

810
00:29:44.054 --> 00:29:45.224
Eun Hyuk, come on.

811
00:29:47.365 --> 00:29:48.365
Please.

812
00:29:48.365 --> 00:29:50.395
(They're in a total mess.)

813
00:29:50.395 --> 00:29:51.895
(It's getting messier as time goes by.)

814
00:29:52.135 --> 00:29:53.135
Ji Min.

815
00:29:53.135 --> 00:29:54.165
(Jin Min and Jin Young's teamwork is good.)

816
00:29:54.165 --> 00:29:55.405
Here she goes!

817
00:29:56.304 --> 00:29:57.905
You can do this! Go for it!

818
00:29:58.774 --> 00:29:59.835
Right here.

819
00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:03.244
(Is the descendant of a basketball player...)

820
00:30:03.244 --> 00:30:04.814
(trying to dunk?)

821
00:30:04.814 --> 00:30:05.915
She's going for the dunk.

822
00:30:05.915 --> 00:30:08.615
(Is the descendant of a basketball player trying to dunk?)

823
00:30:08.615 --> 00:30:10.685
(She fails to dunk by a close call.)

824
00:30:11.254 --> 00:30:12.885
- She tried to dunk. - She went for the dunk.

825
00:30:12.984 --> 00:30:14.754
(Daniel, I'm coming for you!)

826
00:30:15.455 --> 00:30:16.554
(Why?)

827
00:30:16.554 --> 00:30:17.754
- That's it! - He's right there!

828
00:30:18.095 --> 00:30:19.195
He's almost there.

829
00:30:19.195 --> 00:30:20.254
(Why are you coming at me?)

830
00:30:21.195 --> 00:30:22.824
(Extreme Jobs, Being a Basketball Hoop)

831
00:30:24.365 --> 00:30:26.264
(In the midst of this mess,)

832
00:30:26.264 --> 00:30:28.464
(he still has quick reflexes.)

833
00:30:30.304 --> 00:30:34.304
(He runs a lap around the basketball court in an instant.)

834
00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:39.375
Hey, relay races might be fun on this mat. It'll be funny.

835
00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:41.615
(I think I already ran the relay race.)

836
00:30:42.445 --> 00:30:45.754
(Ji Min, the fierce player, has the chance to score again.)

837
00:30:45.754 --> 00:30:47.355
(I'm going to score this time.)

838
00:30:47.355 --> 00:30:48.824
She's behind you.

839
00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:50.754
Hey.

840
00:30:50.754 --> 00:30:51.824
(Team Hyun Moo relies on Won Hee.)

841
00:30:51.824 --> 00:30:53.655
- Run! - No way!

842
00:30:54.524 --> 00:30:56.724
(Daniel, come here.)

843
00:30:57.195 --> 00:31:00.935
(Is it me again?)

844
00:31:00.935 --> 00:31:03.504
(His energy is low after running for 3 times.)

845
00:31:03.504 --> 00:31:04.734
(Won Hee has scored 1 point so far.)

846
00:31:04.734 --> 00:31:06.675
- No, it didn't go in yet. - The ball didn't go in.

847
00:31:06.875 --> 00:31:08.205
- Did it go in? - It counts as a point.

848
00:31:09.804 --> 00:31:10.945
She runs so well.

849
00:31:11.474 --> 00:31:14.044
Eun Hyuk, what are you doing?

850
00:31:14.345 --> 00:31:17.014
I thought you were playing red light, green light.

851
00:31:17.014 --> 00:31:18.355
Keep running. Don't stop.

852
00:31:18.455 --> 00:31:19.514
We should do it now.

853
00:31:20.155 --> 00:31:21.724
Stay there, and I will...

854
00:31:21.724 --> 00:31:23.425
(Won Hee is deployed to the front line.)

855
00:31:23.425 --> 00:31:25.425
- Eun Hyuk, why do you only pass? - Yes?

856
00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:26.595
- Why can't you steal the ball? - Steal the ball from him.

857
00:31:26.595 --> 00:31:27.925
- Ji Min, just do it. - Let's start from here.

858
00:31:27.925 --> 00:31:29.264
- Get it from him. - That's it.

859
00:31:29.724 --> 00:31:31.964
Do your feet have dead skin cells? How could you not feel the pain?

860
00:31:33.195 --> 00:31:35.464
Eun Hyuk's hair looks so cool on stage,

861
00:31:35.464 --> 00:31:36.865
- but his hair looks silly here. - Pass.

862
00:31:37.635 --> 00:31:39.074
Eun Hyuk, you need to score one too.

863
00:31:40.105 --> 00:31:41.105
Go.

864
00:31:41.105 --> 00:31:42.905
I think Eun Hyuk is trying to look cool.

865
00:31:42.905 --> 00:31:44.474
Why did you try that? You were never going to make that shot.

866
00:31:44.574 --> 00:31:47.214
- Can we switch players? - We need time to decide!

867
00:31:47.214 --> 00:31:49.244
He said, "decide", not "time-out".

868
00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:51.415
- Please gather here. - We need a time-out.

869
00:31:51.415 --> 00:31:53.185
Yes, you can have a time-out,

870
00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:55.824
- Have it standing on the mat. - Time-out, please.

871
00:31:55.824 --> 00:31:58.524
- When he played, he complained. - Excuse me.

872
00:31:58.625 --> 00:32:02.895
But now that he's wearing shoes, he's giving them all sort of rules.

873
00:32:03.794 --> 00:32:06.064
If we need to stand on the mat, we don't want a time-out.

874
00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:07.964
Please, Eun Hyuk.

875
00:32:07.964 --> 00:32:10.105
- Hey, you. - Don't let her come here.

876
00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:12.635
(He passes without looking.)

877
00:32:12.635 --> 00:32:14.244
I told you not to do something that you can't pull off.

878
00:32:15.345 --> 00:32:16.605
Eun Hyuk, please.

879
00:32:17.115 --> 00:32:18.345
Eun Hyuk, please.

880
00:32:18.845 --> 00:32:19.845
That's it.

881
00:32:20.014 --> 00:32:21.284
- Daniel. - Seriously.

882
00:32:21.714 --> 00:32:24.615
(Hey, give me the ball.)

883
00:32:24.615 --> 00:32:27.984
(Eun Hyuk causes a setback for his team by blocking the way.)

884
00:32:27.984 --> 00:32:31.855
(With Eun Hyuk blocking the way, he escapes without any problems.)

885
00:32:31.855 --> 00:32:33.925
(I love Eun Hyuk.)

886
00:32:33.925 --> 00:32:36.324
Put it on your shoulder! Do it.

887
00:32:36.324 --> 00:32:37.395
(Ji Min gets the ball again.)

888
00:32:37.734 --> 00:32:39.234
- Ji Min. - I'm sorry.

889
00:32:39.234 --> 00:32:40.564
(The fierce player is back.)

890
00:32:40.564 --> 00:32:42.165
Ji Min is really fast.

891
00:32:42.504 --> 00:32:43.804
Put it in!

892
00:32:44.175 --> 00:32:46.335
What are you doing, Eun Hyuk?

893
00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:48.274
(Let's just call it quits.)

894
00:32:48.274 --> 00:32:49.405
It hurts so much.

895
00:32:49.605 --> 00:32:51.074
(Hyun Moo tries to escape from Ji Min's side.)

896
00:32:51.074 --> 00:32:52.175
Right here!

897
00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:54.085
Right here!

898
00:32:54.314 --> 00:32:57.615
(Ji Min, pass it to me!)

899
00:32:57.615 --> 00:32:59.415
(The target is walking towards him.)

900
00:32:59.955 --> 00:33:01.024
Right here!

901
00:33:01.224 --> 00:33:02.254
(If we score this...)

902
00:33:02.254 --> 00:33:03.385
What is that?

903
00:33:03.925 --> 00:33:07.764
(We'll be able to take the lead with this shot.)

904
00:33:07.764 --> 00:33:09.294
What is that?

905
00:33:09.294 --> 00:33:11.494
(The daughter of a basketball player passes the ball.)

906
00:33:12.464 --> 00:33:13.534
No, no.

907
00:33:14.234 --> 00:33:16.435
- 4, 3... - Yes!

908
00:33:16.435 --> 00:33:18.675
(With few seconds left, they obtain a point.)

909
00:33:18.905 --> 00:33:20.074
We won!

910
00:33:20.074 --> 00:33:22.774
(Jin Young has scored 2 points so far.)

911
00:33:22.945 --> 00:33:24.074
We won!

912
00:33:24.544 --> 00:33:25.615
Give me a second.

913
00:33:25.615 --> 00:33:26.845
(Team Jang Hoon wins!)

914
00:33:26.845 --> 00:33:27.945
Good job.

915
00:33:27.945 --> 00:33:29.514
Great work. Well done.

916
00:33:30.284 --> 00:33:33.415
Good job. Everyone, good work.

917
00:33:33.554 --> 00:33:35.685
- Daniel, you did well. - Good job.

918
00:33:35.784 --> 00:33:36.885
Okay.

919
00:33:37.155 --> 00:33:40.254
This concludes Team Jang Hoon wins the game, Moving Basketball Hoop.

920
00:33:40.254 --> 00:33:41.425
(Which Key Guide will they choose?)

921
00:33:41.425 --> 00:33:43.595
- Yes! - We'll give you the Key Guide.

922
00:33:47.304 --> 00:33:50.705
All right. Let's read the Key Guide.

923
00:33:50.804 --> 00:33:52.804
Read the menu and choose one.

924
00:33:53.004 --> 00:33:55.004
- I want jjajangmyeon. - I want jjamppong.

925
00:33:55.004 --> 00:33:56.445
I want stir-fried spicy pork.

926
00:33:56.445 --> 00:33:58.145
Stir-fried spicy pork? I guess you like stir-fried spicy pork.

927
00:33:58.145 --> 00:34:00.415
Bring us our food, please.

928
00:34:00.415 --> 00:34:01.744
Do Chinese restaurants serve stir-fried spicy pork?

929
00:34:02.145 --> 00:34:03.214
Yes, they do.

930
00:34:03.984 --> 00:34:05.455
Everyone should choose the same one.

931
00:34:05.455 --> 00:34:07.925
(Winning 6 players can find out 1 player has the Master Key or not.)

932
00:34:07.925 --> 00:34:09.324
We don't need the rest of them.

933
00:34:09.324 --> 00:34:10.895
- That one is the most important. - Let's go with that.

934
00:34:10.895 --> 00:34:12.594
Isn't this one better?

935
00:34:13.025 --> 00:34:15.264
They even take forever to even choose one of the hints.

936
00:34:15.795 --> 00:34:17.665
- Guys, just choose one. - We should go with this.

937
00:34:18.094 --> 00:34:19.965
- Okay. - We're having half and half.

938
00:34:19.965 --> 00:34:21.565
- All right. - Which one did you choose?

939
00:34:22.105 --> 00:34:26.674
The one we have chosen is the first one on the Key Guide.

940
00:34:26.674 --> 00:34:29.705
6 players of the winning team can name 1 player...

941
00:34:29.804 --> 00:34:32.315
of their choice among 12 players.

942
00:34:32.614 --> 00:34:34.485
Only these players will find out...

943
00:34:34.715 --> 00:34:37.614
if the chosen player has the Master Key or not.

944
00:34:37.855 --> 00:34:40.085
Since it says they can choose anyone among 12 players, you can...

945
00:34:40.085 --> 00:34:42.625
- name a player from your team. - Right.

946
00:34:42.625 --> 00:34:44.955
We'll choose one player.

947
00:34:44.955 --> 00:34:47.395
- Only we get to check the result. - That's correct.

948
00:34:47.395 --> 00:34:50.065
You won't know if that player is the Angel or Demon.

949
00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:53.094
- You'll get either "Yes" or "No". - I see.

950
00:34:53.804 --> 00:34:56.134
Then even with that, there's a 50 to 50 chance.

951
00:34:56.965 --> 00:34:59.534
When they name the player, observe them to figure out the player.

952
00:34:59.534 --> 00:35:02.074
Whoever is chosen must tell the truth, right?

953
00:35:02.074 --> 00:35:03.875
They can act like that's the truth.

954
00:35:07.344 --> 00:35:10.855
(Does Seong Wu have the Master Key? Does Sang Min have the Master Key?)

955
00:35:11.784 --> 00:35:13.284
(Ji Min has disappeared.)

956
00:35:13.284 --> 00:35:14.585
- Ji Min! - Yes?

957
00:35:14.685 --> 00:35:18.224
This is a big show. You need to still be on the camera.

958
00:35:18.554 --> 00:35:20.094
(Does Jang Hoon have the Master Key?)

959
00:35:20.094 --> 00:35:21.924
I'm done writing. I'll put it here.

960
00:35:22.065 --> 00:35:23.165
Are you done writing it down?

961
00:35:23.165 --> 00:35:25.235
(When they hand over the paper, they'll get the answer.)

962
00:35:25.235 --> 00:35:27.065
Once they get their own envelope,

963
00:35:27.205 --> 00:35:30.474
all we can do is just observing their faces.

964
00:35:31.375 --> 00:35:32.674
This is yours, Ji Min.

965
00:35:33.275 --> 00:35:34.275
(They receive their answers.)

966
00:35:34.275 --> 00:35:36.344
- Thank you. - I feel like I'm being paid.

967
00:35:36.474 --> 00:35:38.145
- Jang Hoon looks like a gangster. - This looks like a drama.

968
00:35:38.145 --> 00:35:39.674
He's Boss Seo.

969
00:35:40.344 --> 00:35:43.014
- Thank you. - He gives out 100,000 dollars.

970
00:35:43.415 --> 00:35:45.085
The answer says on the paper?

971
00:35:45.215 --> 00:35:47.625
- Yes. It's either "Yes" or "No". - I see.

972
00:35:48.324 --> 00:35:49.554
Should I read it in front of this camera?

973
00:35:49.924 --> 00:35:51.994
(Daniel has or does not the Master Key.)

974
00:35:51.994 --> 00:35:56.264
(This is their golden opportunity to find out a suspicious player.)

975
00:35:56.795 --> 00:35:58.264
I just got the goose bumps. Is this true?

976
00:35:59.565 --> 00:36:01.705
We can't check other people's answers, can we?

977
00:36:01.804 --> 00:36:02.904
No, you can't.

978
00:36:03.105 --> 00:36:04.505
(Seong Wu has or does not have the Master Key.)

979
00:36:04.505 --> 00:36:05.634
This is amazing.

980
00:36:06.435 --> 00:36:07.844
We can't show it to other people.

981
00:36:07.844 --> 00:36:09.974
We can't show it to them, but we can tell them.

982
00:36:10.344 --> 00:36:16.384
(Ji Min has or doesn't have the Key. Jang Hoon has or does not the Key.)

983
00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:18.284
Jang Hoon, why do you look like you're hiding something?

984
00:36:18.415 --> 00:36:20.685
Did you just call me ugly?

985
00:36:21.525 --> 00:36:25.694
(Sang Min has or does not have the Master Key.)

986
00:36:27.424 --> 00:36:30.935
(Why is Daniel so surprised?)

987
00:36:30.935 --> 00:36:33.395
(He asked if Sang Min has the Master Key.)

988
00:36:33.395 --> 00:36:35.735
(What was the answer?)

989
00:36:36.764 --> 00:36:40.875
(The player of your choice has the Master Key.)

990
00:36:41.244 --> 00:36:43.915
(Sang Min is either the Angel or the Demon.)

991
00:36:43.915 --> 00:36:45.944
Is this key the Master Key?

992
00:36:46.844 --> 00:36:49.514
(Yes, this key is the Master Key.)

993
00:36:50.085 --> 00:36:52.054
(After he found out his key was the Master Key,)

994
00:36:53.384 --> 00:36:56.654
(He kept his composure.)

995
00:36:56.654 --> 00:36:58.694
(He even checked the upsides of being the Angel.)

996
00:36:58.694 --> 00:37:01.224
(Afterward, he started to tell them he is the Angel.)

997
00:37:01.224 --> 00:37:04.465
(He tried his best to win the game in order to acquire the Key Guide.)

998
00:37:10.735 --> 00:37:15.474
(Or is he the Demon and trying to keep prize money all to himself?)

999
00:37:16.375 --> 00:37:18.474
You can tell the truth...

1000
00:37:18.614 --> 00:37:20.014
or trick your team.

1001
00:37:20.014 --> 00:37:21.915
- Whom did you choose? - What about you?

1002
00:37:22.545 --> 00:37:25.014
Hey, Hee Chul. You can't doubt me.

1003
00:37:25.014 --> 00:37:26.014
So whom did you choose?

1004
00:37:26.014 --> 00:37:27.424
- Won Hee doesn't have it. - Whom did you pick?

1005
00:37:27.424 --> 00:37:29.455
- Jin Young, whom did you pick? - Did you write, "Park Jin Young"?

1006
00:37:29.685 --> 00:37:31.554
No, I didn't.

1007
00:37:31.554 --> 00:37:33.554
- Whose name did you write? - I wrote Sang Min's name.

1008
00:37:33.654 --> 00:37:35.125
- Oh, right. - What was it?

1009
00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:36.994
- He has it. - Was the answer, "Yes"?

1010
00:37:37.295 --> 00:37:38.435
He does have the Key.

1011
00:37:38.594 --> 00:37:43.665
(Sang Min has the Master Key?)

1012
00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:46.904
Daniel, you're saying you wrote his name, and he has the Key?

1013
00:37:46.904 --> 00:37:48.404
- Come on. - There are other people here.

1014
00:37:48.404 --> 00:37:49.744
The other team is standing there.

1015
00:37:49.744 --> 00:37:52.114
- It's not that, but you guys... - Wait.

1016
00:37:52.114 --> 00:37:54.815
(This guy in a white shirt seems particularly suspicious.)

1017
00:37:54.915 --> 00:37:58.014
Do you think we're that dumb? Your elbow isn't a camera.

1018
00:37:58.415 --> 00:38:00.985
My goodness. Oh, dear.

1019
00:38:00.985 --> 00:38:02.284
- This is what he did. - His clothes...

1020
00:38:02.485 --> 00:38:03.795
How can this be? Be serious.

1021
00:38:04.054 --> 00:38:05.955
This isn't a missile.

1022
00:38:05.955 --> 00:38:07.795
(My gosh, I was so close.)

1023
00:38:07.795 --> 00:38:09.395
- This is... - But we didn't realize it.

1024
00:38:09.824 --> 00:38:11.565
- Let's go. - We didn't see him there.

1025
00:38:11.994 --> 00:38:13.065
Let's go.

1026
00:38:13.594 --> 00:38:14.804
- Hey. - What?

1027
00:38:14.904 --> 00:38:16.005
- What is it? - Hold on.

1028
00:38:17.605 --> 00:38:19.174
- What do you want? - Just give me a second.

1029
00:38:19.304 --> 00:38:20.904
- Come here. - Why?

1030
00:38:20.904 --> 00:38:22.375
Just this once.

1031
00:38:23.105 --> 00:38:26.674
(They are in the same group. Will they tell the truth?)

1032
00:38:26.674 --> 00:38:29.215
Jackson, I found out you don't have the Key.

1033
00:38:30.045 --> 00:38:31.514
Did you choose me?

1034
00:38:31.614 --> 00:38:34.054
Our team just discussed this, and you don't have it.

1035
00:38:34.054 --> 00:38:35.085
- You know? - Yes.

1036
00:38:35.085 --> 00:38:37.355
- Your key isn't the Master Key. - You know? It's not.

1037
00:38:38.194 --> 00:38:40.665
I know everyone's keys.

1038
00:38:40.965 --> 00:38:43.224
So whom do you want me to vote for?

1039
00:38:43.795 --> 00:38:45.065
I need to do more digging.

1040
00:38:45.364 --> 00:38:48.605
- I'm Angel. I must find Demon. - Are you lying to me?

1041
00:38:49.435 --> 00:38:50.505
You're the Angel?

1042
00:38:50.505 --> 00:38:52.804
- So it's like... - In my heart, you are an angel.

1043
00:38:53.134 --> 00:38:54.944
You need to trust me.

1044
00:38:54.944 --> 00:38:57.974
(You need to trust me.)

1045
00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:00.344
- Trust me. - Trust you?

1046
00:39:00.344 --> 00:39:02.045
- Yes. - Then swear it to me.

1047
00:39:02.045 --> 00:39:04.654
- Sang Min's key... - I'm sure it's not the Master Key.

1048
00:39:04.654 --> 00:39:05.884
- No, he has the Master Key. - He does?

1049
00:39:06.014 --> 00:39:07.755
He's the Demon.

1050
00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:09.324
(Really?)

1051
00:39:09.324 --> 00:39:12.154
- He said he didn't have it. - Only he has the Key on your team.

1052
00:39:12.824 --> 00:39:14.165
Sang Min has the Key...

1053
00:39:14.165 --> 00:39:15.665
which means he's the Demon.

1054
00:39:15.665 --> 00:39:18.395
Hey, I told you. Don't even try to act when you're with me.

1055
00:39:18.764 --> 00:39:19.864
Trust me.

1056
00:39:20.194 --> 00:39:21.505
After the shoot,

1057
00:39:21.505 --> 00:39:23.605
you're going to tell me that it was for the show, aren't you?

1058
00:39:23.904 --> 00:39:25.034
Be honest with yourself.

1059
00:39:25.335 --> 00:39:27.145
- Don't say this after the shoot. - Okay. I got it.

1060
00:39:27.145 --> 00:39:29.074
- I hold grudges. - I know that.

1061
00:39:29.205 --> 00:39:30.344
I know you.

1062
00:39:30.344 --> 00:39:31.974
(Is Sang Min really the Demon?)

1063
00:39:32.844 --> 00:39:35.815
(While the members of Got7 are sizing each other up...)

1064
00:39:36.114 --> 00:39:37.955
I would like iced vanilla latte.

1065
00:39:37.955 --> 00:39:41.455
(Daniel confirmed that Sang Min has the Master Key.)

1066
00:39:41.455 --> 00:39:42.554
You do have the Key.

1067
00:39:43.284 --> 00:39:44.654
I checked you out.

1068
00:39:44.654 --> 00:39:48.494
(You checked my key? I see.)

1069
00:39:49.864 --> 00:39:51.435
- I know yours isn't the Key. - Wait.

1070
00:39:51.435 --> 00:39:53.694
- Daniel, I need a word with you. - Why?

1071
00:39:54.165 --> 00:39:55.465
- He's too... - It'll take only a few seconds.

1072
00:39:55.465 --> 00:39:57.335
- I just need one minute. - Didn't I tell you?

1073
00:39:57.335 --> 00:39:58.735
- I said that? - Yes.

1074
00:39:59.205 --> 00:40:00.944
I was going to trust him.

1075
00:40:02.605 --> 00:40:05.474
Assuming you're neither Angel nor Demon,

1076
00:40:05.775 --> 00:40:08.784
I'll insist that you're Angel.

1077
00:40:09.485 --> 00:40:10.755
Sang Min is Demon.

1078
00:40:12.315 --> 00:40:14.185
Daniel has two votes.

1079
00:40:14.185 --> 00:40:16.384
He keeps talking to him, which means he's Demon.

1080
00:40:17.255 --> 00:40:18.924
Sang Min is Demon.

1081
00:40:19.054 --> 00:40:20.295
- Really? - Yes.

1082
00:40:20.295 --> 00:40:22.824
(He spreads a rumor that Sang Min is Demon.)

1083
00:40:22.824 --> 00:40:25.194
It's certain that Sang Min is Demon.

1084
00:40:25.264 --> 00:40:27.364
- What's certain? - He's Demon.

1085
00:40:27.864 --> 00:40:29.735
It's because I'm Angel.

1086
00:40:30.404 --> 00:40:33.034
- Stop it. - I'm not kidding.

1087
00:40:33.034 --> 00:40:35.045
- I acted like him last week. - Why didn't I check?

1088
00:40:35.045 --> 00:40:36.045
I acted like him last week.

1089
00:40:36.045 --> 00:40:38.614
- I don't know how to be convincing. - I wasn't good at convincing.

1090
00:40:38.614 --> 00:40:42.284
(Seong Wu begs others to believe that he's Angel.)

1091
00:40:42.344 --> 00:40:44.784
(Right after Key Guide...)

1092
00:40:45.815 --> 00:40:47.985
- What did you read? - You aren't it.

1093
00:40:47.985 --> 00:40:50.054
What are you talking about? You're so arrogant.

1094
00:40:50.054 --> 00:40:51.755
- When I opened it, it said... - You're forward.

1095
00:40:51.755 --> 00:40:52.924
- "It's not Seong Wu." - "It's not Seong Wu."

1096
00:40:52.924 --> 00:40:54.324
That's what it said.

1097
00:40:54.795 --> 00:40:56.824
We'll be in trouble if you do this.

1098
00:40:56.824 --> 00:40:58.735
- It really said, - You must believe me.

1099
00:40:58.735 --> 00:41:00.194
"It's not Seong Wu."

1100
00:41:00.864 --> 00:41:01.935
My goodness.

1101
00:41:01.935 --> 00:41:04.235
Please believe me.

1102
00:41:04.235 --> 00:41:07.034
You must support me to get the key.

1103
00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:09.145
- If... - Don't you want fried chicken?

1104
00:41:09.145 --> 00:41:11.415
- I do. - I want some soy sauce chicken.

1105
00:41:11.744 --> 00:41:12.775
I want chicken tenders.

1106
00:41:12.915 --> 00:41:14.114
I prefer with bones.

1107
00:41:14.114 --> 00:41:16.045
What about chicken tenders and regular chicken?

1108
00:41:16.045 --> 00:41:17.784
They don't believe me.

1109
00:41:18.755 --> 00:41:19.755
I want soy sauce chicken.

1110
00:41:19.755 --> 00:41:22.085
- Will you buy us chicken? - Is there any nearby?

1111
00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:25.795
I'll ask the managers.

1112
00:41:27.395 --> 00:41:28.465
Seong Wu.

1113
00:41:28.764 --> 00:41:30.594
Who do you think is Angel?

1114
00:41:30.764 --> 00:41:32.094
I'm Angel.

1115
00:41:33.465 --> 00:41:35.235
- He doesn't fall for it. - I know.

1116
00:41:35.764 --> 00:41:39.074
I'm about to lose my mind because no one believes me.

1117
00:41:39.474 --> 00:41:40.705
I should change the way I talk.

1118
00:41:40.705 --> 00:41:43.105
I sound too much...

1119
00:41:43.404 --> 00:41:44.875
- I know what you mean. - like a fool.

1120
00:41:44.875 --> 00:41:46.815
- I sound like a fool. - I'm Angel.

1121
00:41:48.284 --> 00:41:50.014
(He's exhausted.)

1122
00:41:50.014 --> 00:41:51.554
Please support me.

1123
00:41:52.085 --> 00:41:54.324
- I'm... - Are you teasing me?

1124
00:41:54.585 --> 00:41:57.054
You both know that I'm Angel,

1125
00:41:57.054 --> 00:41:58.554
- but you're teasing me. - I don't know.

1126
00:41:58.554 --> 00:42:00.565
You're trying to make me buy you chicken.

1127
00:42:00.565 --> 00:42:02.324
- How would we know? - How would we know?

1128
00:42:03.065 --> 00:42:04.565
We don't know the answer.

1129
00:42:04.565 --> 00:42:05.634
(Please believe me.)

1130
00:42:06.435 --> 00:42:07.465
(The 3 insist that they're Angel.)

1131
00:42:07.465 --> 00:42:09.435
(Is there Angel or Demon among them?)

1132
00:42:10.574 --> 00:42:13.904
(Investigation Mission 2)

1133
00:42:15.404 --> 00:42:16.574
(What's the second Investigation Mission?)

1134
00:42:16.574 --> 00:42:17.775
Shall we take off our shoes?

1135
00:42:17.974 --> 00:42:19.014
Is it jumping?

1136
00:42:19.014 --> 00:42:21.215
Here's the second passerby who's hairy.

1137
00:42:22.215 --> 00:42:23.415
My goodness.

1138
00:42:23.415 --> 00:42:25.485
- Do you want to fail together? - That's not how it's done.

1139
00:42:25.485 --> 00:42:26.985
Jang Hoon is rather playful.

1140
00:42:26.985 --> 00:42:29.324
Why are you following me?

1141
00:42:29.324 --> 00:42:30.855
Follow someone else.

1142
00:42:30.855 --> 00:42:32.795
- You're being frustrating. - Goodness.

1143
00:42:32.795 --> 00:42:35.194
- That's not how to play it. - Why is he following me?

1144
00:42:35.194 --> 00:42:36.764
You're terrible at playing psychological games.

1145
00:42:36.764 --> 00:42:38.665
Sang Min is definitely Demon.

1146
00:42:39.565 --> 00:42:41.065
Sang Min is definitely Demon.

1147
00:42:41.565 --> 00:42:43.134
- What about Seong Wu? - Seong Wu...

1148
00:42:44.105 --> 00:42:46.174
Seong Wu is neither.

1149
00:42:47.645 --> 00:42:48.974
I stopped Seong Wu.

1150
00:42:48.974 --> 00:42:52.944
I lied to him that Jackson is neither.

1151
00:42:53.815 --> 00:42:55.344
He believed me.

1152
00:42:55.514 --> 00:42:58.014
Everyone is bad at playing psychological games.

1153
00:42:58.014 --> 00:42:59.014
What are you saying?

1154
00:42:59.014 --> 00:43:01.025
He said that 100 times...

1155
00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:03.585
while following me.

1156
00:43:03.585 --> 00:43:06.255
- That's not how to play it. - I heard you.

1157
00:43:06.255 --> 00:43:07.594
- Gosh. - What?

1158
00:43:07.594 --> 00:43:09.264
He's doomed anyway.

1159
00:43:09.264 --> 00:43:11.494
Jang Hoon was doomed first.

1160
00:43:11.494 --> 00:43:13.494
The second to be doomed is Sang Min.

1161
00:43:13.494 --> 00:43:15.804
If I say that I'm Angel from the start,

1162
00:43:15.804 --> 00:43:18.474
I was worried that everyone would bother me.

1163
00:43:18.474 --> 00:43:20.875
Who was Angel last week?

1164
00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:22.105
- It was me. - Daniel.

1165
00:43:22.105 --> 00:43:23.974
- I respect you. - Why?

1166
00:43:23.974 --> 00:43:26.014
How did you stand the frustration?

1167
00:43:26.014 --> 00:43:28.244
- Why are you acting? - You're obviously acting.

1168
00:43:28.244 --> 00:43:30.855
- You should wait. - You're obviously acting.

1169
00:43:30.955 --> 00:43:33.054
- Now... - What's the next game?

1170
00:43:33.054 --> 00:43:35.755
The second game is called Rubber Band Fencing.

1171
00:43:36.025 --> 00:43:38.295
We play 1 against 1.

1172
00:43:38.295 --> 00:43:40.255
Two members of the opponent team...

1173
00:43:40.255 --> 00:43:42.424
pull on the player so that he can't go forward.

1174
00:43:42.424 --> 00:43:45.335
The player must resist and go forward.

1175
00:43:45.335 --> 00:43:48.165
The one to pop the opponent's balloon wins.

1176
00:43:48.565 --> 00:43:50.804
- Therefore... - They have an advantage.

1177
00:43:50.804 --> 00:43:53.435
Jackson used to be a professional fencing player.

1178
00:43:53.435 --> 00:43:56.174
- That's unfair. - If you consider that...

1179
00:43:56.275 --> 00:43:58.415
He was a national athlete in fencing.

1180
00:43:59.014 --> 00:44:01.485
- That's unfair. - If you consider that,

1181
00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:02.884
Jang Hoon is too tall.

1182
00:44:02.884 --> 00:44:04.755
Everyone has a disadvantage.

1183
00:44:04.755 --> 00:44:07.085
We played basketball against a professional player.

1184
00:44:07.085 --> 00:44:08.824
He's not good at basketball.

1185
00:44:09.224 --> 00:44:10.424
(He tries to remain calm.)

1186
00:44:10.424 --> 00:44:12.255
When asked to play basketball,

1187
00:44:12.255 --> 00:44:15.194
he complains about his weak bones or neck pain.

1188
00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:16.864
What is he good at?

1189
00:44:16.864 --> 00:44:18.264
He's bad at psychological games.

1190
00:44:18.264 --> 00:44:21.465
I'm not usually on shows with many people because...

1191
00:44:21.665 --> 00:44:23.404
it hurts my ears.

1192
00:44:23.935 --> 00:44:26.574
He says that his eyes and ears hurt.

1193
00:44:26.574 --> 00:44:27.775
Let's just play.

1194
00:44:29.545 --> 00:44:31.375
Player number one.

1195
00:44:31.474 --> 00:44:32.915
- Start. - Wait.

1196
00:44:32.915 --> 00:44:36.844
(Daniel from Team Jang Hoon versus Sang Min from Team Hyun Moo)

1197
00:44:36.844 --> 00:44:40.014
Yes, we won.

1198
00:44:40.014 --> 00:44:41.284
- Wait. - We won.

1199
00:44:41.284 --> 00:44:43.654
It will be difficult.

1200
00:44:43.654 --> 00:44:45.654
Let me give you an advice.

1201
00:44:45.654 --> 00:44:47.994
If you move forward and back quickly,

1202
00:44:47.994 --> 00:44:50.224
Sang Min will pass out from the energy.

1203
00:44:50.224 --> 00:44:51.395
He'll pass out.

1204
00:44:51.395 --> 00:44:53.494
You have to win within 30 seconds.

1205
00:44:53.494 --> 00:44:55.465
He hasn't taken medicine in a long time.

1206
00:44:55.465 --> 00:44:58.034
You have to win immediately, okay?

1207
00:44:58.034 --> 00:44:59.235
(Goodness.)

1208
00:44:59.235 --> 00:45:00.235
What's going on?

1209
00:45:00.235 --> 00:45:02.304
- That's great, Daniel. - He's strong.

1210
00:45:02.505 --> 00:45:03.875
He's really strong.

1211
00:45:03.875 --> 00:45:05.574
(He increases his power.)

1212
00:45:06.715 --> 00:45:08.485
(It's the strength of a man.)

1213
00:45:08.485 --> 00:45:10.685
We already lost, Sang Min.

1214
00:45:11.284 --> 00:45:12.315
We're doomed.

1215
00:45:12.315 --> 00:45:13.315
(We already lost.)

1216
00:45:13.685 --> 00:45:15.424
- Let's play a good game. - You can do it.

1217
00:45:15.424 --> 00:45:17.255
- Let's play a good game. - Be careful of your back.

1218
00:45:17.255 --> 00:45:20.355
I gave everything to Daniel.

1219
00:45:20.355 --> 00:45:22.694
It's okay even if I lose.

1220
00:45:22.694 --> 00:45:24.395
You shouldn't say that.

1221
00:45:24.395 --> 00:45:26.264
However,

1222
00:45:26.264 --> 00:45:28.735
please understand if I play my way and win.

1223
00:45:29.404 --> 00:45:30.505
Let's go.

1224
00:45:30.505 --> 00:45:32.505
- You must win at the start. - Okay.

1225
00:45:32.505 --> 00:45:33.534
Start.

1226
00:45:33.534 --> 00:45:35.775
(Who will be the winner?)

1227
00:45:35.775 --> 00:45:37.415
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1228
00:45:38.014 --> 00:45:39.444
Hey, hey.

1229
00:45:39.974 --> 00:45:41.645
(He sways.)

1230
00:45:42.014 --> 00:45:44.384
- Hey, hey. - It looks uncomfortable.

1231
00:45:44.384 --> 00:45:46.784
- Wait, Sang Min. - Is it martial arts?

1232
00:45:46.784 --> 00:45:48.125
(Is it martial arts or fencing?)

1233
00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:49.554
It's too loose.

1234
00:45:49.554 --> 00:45:51.224
Hey, hey.

1235
00:45:51.224 --> 00:45:52.554
Let's go.

1236
00:45:52.554 --> 00:45:53.824
He seems unstable.

1237
00:45:53.824 --> 00:45:55.364
- Hey, hey. - It's martial arts.

1238
00:45:55.364 --> 00:45:56.565
(He gets ready.)

1239
00:45:56.565 --> 00:46:01.034
(He's about to use his secret technique.)

1240
00:46:01.764 --> 00:46:02.764
Let's go.

1241
00:46:03.835 --> 00:46:04.875
(He falls.)

1242
00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:06.775
- Come on. - What happened?

1243
00:46:06.775 --> 00:46:09.404
(It's not fencing. He's playing darts.)

1244
00:46:09.404 --> 00:46:11.875
(He fails in the end.)

1245
00:46:11.875 --> 00:46:13.275
(He picks up his sword.)

1246
00:46:13.275 --> 00:46:14.545
Attack him now.

1247
00:46:15.145 --> 00:46:17.085
- What's going on? - He seems unstable.

1248
00:46:17.085 --> 00:46:18.884
What is Sang Min doing?

1249
00:46:19.284 --> 00:46:20.625
(Here I go.)

1250
00:46:21.025 --> 00:46:22.125
Wait a minute.

1251
00:46:22.585 --> 00:46:24.994
(His energy is explosive.)

1252
00:46:25.755 --> 00:46:27.395
Won Hee might fly off.

1253
00:46:27.395 --> 00:46:29.625
We don't need to pull Sang Min.

1254
00:46:29.625 --> 00:46:32.465
(The game is too easy for them.)

1255
00:46:32.864 --> 00:46:35.965
- Let Sang Min do what he wants. - Do what you want.

1256
00:46:35.965 --> 00:46:38.534
(Grant him his freedom to play fencing.)

1257
00:46:39.435 --> 00:46:42.744
(He failed his first attempt, but he has another plan.)

1258
00:46:43.944 --> 00:46:44.974
(Startled)

1259
00:46:44.974 --> 00:46:46.014
No.

1260
00:46:46.815 --> 00:46:49.315
(He puts down his guard.)

1261
00:46:49.315 --> 00:46:52.085
(Here I come to pop the balloon.)

1262
00:46:56.485 --> 00:46:57.654
(Popping and jumping)

1263
00:46:58.994 --> 00:47:00.494
(Did everyone see that?)

1264
00:47:00.494 --> 00:47:01.565
Seriously?

1265
00:47:03.264 --> 00:47:05.494
(He jumps and attacks.)

1266
00:47:05.494 --> 00:47:10.165
(Is this Sang Min that we know?)

1267
00:47:10.804 --> 00:47:13.674
That technique is from a movie.

1268
00:47:13.674 --> 00:47:16.744
It's not what we expected, so you must play again.

1269
00:47:17.674 --> 00:47:18.944
What happened?

1270
00:47:18.944 --> 00:47:21.715
- Sang Min wins. - That was good.

1271
00:47:21.715 --> 00:47:24.255
Daniel, it's humiliating for you.

1272
00:47:24.554 --> 00:47:26.114
- I feel terrible. - Sang Min.

1273
00:47:26.114 --> 00:47:27.554
It's completely humiliating.

1274
00:47:27.554 --> 00:47:28.955
It's from a movie.

1275
00:47:28.955 --> 00:47:30.025
That was amazing.

1276
00:47:30.025 --> 00:47:31.025
It was great.

1277
00:47:31.025 --> 00:47:32.855
He jumped and attacked.

1278
00:47:32.855 --> 00:47:35.694
(He does a finishing pose.)

1279
00:47:36.295 --> 00:47:38.235
(Round 2 starts.)

1280
00:47:38.235 --> 00:47:40.835
- It's Hee Chul. - Hee Chul.

1281
00:47:40.835 --> 00:47:42.235
Let me carefully say...

1282
00:47:42.235 --> 00:47:44.705
- that I expect Hee Chul to win. - You don't need to be careful.

1283
00:47:44.705 --> 00:47:47.344
It's because he's quite trained physically.

1284
00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:48.404
- Right. - What about me?

1285
00:47:48.404 --> 00:47:49.744
Hyun Moo?

1286
00:47:49.844 --> 00:47:52.715
I've never seen him play fencing before.

1287
00:47:53.315 --> 00:47:54.485
I think...

1288
00:47:54.485 --> 00:47:55.514
I'll surprise you.

1289
00:47:55.514 --> 00:47:57.755
- This round is important. - Let's go.

1290
00:47:57.755 --> 00:47:59.585
I'll show you why I'm Angel.

1291
00:48:00.154 --> 00:48:01.554
Get ready.

1292
00:48:01.955 --> 00:48:04.654
Start.

1293
00:48:04.654 --> 00:48:06.594
- Let's go, Ji Min. - Let's go.

1294
00:48:06.594 --> 00:48:08.194
Vote for me, Won Hee.

1295
00:48:08.864 --> 00:48:09.924
Let's go, Won Hee.

1296
00:48:09.924 --> 00:48:10.935
Let's go.

1297
00:48:11.235 --> 00:48:12.264
Let's go.

1298
00:48:12.494 --> 00:48:15.005
I'm really good at it because I play games a lot.

1299
00:48:15.804 --> 00:48:17.735
Look how clumsy he is.

1300
00:48:18.105 --> 00:48:20.804
He has nothing other than "Lucifer".

1301
00:48:21.174 --> 00:48:22.404
(Stop being clumsy.)

1302
00:48:22.404 --> 00:48:23.875
(It's easy to pull him.)

1303
00:48:24.244 --> 00:48:25.244
(Shall I start attacking?)

1304
00:48:26.674 --> 00:48:27.685
(Swing)

1305
00:48:28.545 --> 00:48:29.744
Goodness.

1306
00:48:29.744 --> 00:48:30.915
(He swings about.)

1307
00:48:30.915 --> 00:48:32.715
(He's about to hit everyone.)

1308
00:48:33.282 --> 00:48:34.313
We should back up.

1309
00:48:34.313 --> 00:48:35.683
Back up.

1310
00:48:36.512 --> 00:48:37.523
It's almost over.

1311
00:48:38.152 --> 00:48:39.382
Goodness.

1312
00:48:39.382 --> 00:48:42.253
My team members... I'm sorry.

1313
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:49.749
(He has strong defense.)

1314
00:48:50.678 --> 00:48:52.419
(Is it the sword or the shield?)

1315
00:48:52.419 --> 00:48:54.119
It looks like an actual game.

1316
00:48:55.259 --> 00:48:58.059
(It goes well.)

1317
00:48:58.083 --> 00:49:00.083
(Who will be the winner?)

1318
00:49:05.107 --> 00:49:10.107
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] SBS E06 Master Key "Massage Board Basketball"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

1319
00:49:16.374 --> 00:49:17.385
(Swing)

1320
00:49:18.245 --> 00:49:19.444
Goodness.

1321
00:49:19.444 --> 00:49:20.615
(He swings about.)

1322
00:49:20.615 --> 00:49:22.415
(He's about to hit everyone.)

1323
00:49:22.982 --> 00:49:24.013
We should back up.

1324
00:49:24.013 --> 00:49:25.383
Back up.

1325
00:49:26.212 --> 00:49:27.223
It's almost over.

1326
00:49:27.852 --> 00:49:29.082
Goodness.

1327
00:49:29.082 --> 00:49:31.953
My team members... I'm sorry.

1328
00:49:37.509 --> 00:49:39.449
(He has strong defense.)

1329
00:49:40.378 --> 00:49:42.119
(Is it the sword or the shield?)

1330
00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:43.819
It looks like an actual game.

1331
00:49:44.418 --> 00:49:46.119
It looks like an actual game.

1332
00:49:49.418 --> 00:49:51.588
(He successfully attacks him in one go.)

1333
00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:55.759
(Hyun Moo is humiliated.)

1334
00:49:56.228 --> 00:49:58.429
Did I hit your face?

1335
00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:00.569
(Thanks to Hee Chul, the scores are tied.)

1336
00:50:00.569 --> 00:50:01.569
All right.

1337
00:50:03.168 --> 00:50:04.268
(He's still clumsy.)

1338
00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:06.239
Look at him.

1339
00:50:06.639 --> 00:50:08.978
- I knew Hee Chul would win. - Right.

1340
00:50:09.478 --> 00:50:11.378
Hyun Moo is no match for him.

1341
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:13.708
I wanted to pop the bottom one.

1342
00:50:13.708 --> 00:50:14.779
(He attacks Hyun Moo.)

1343
00:50:14.819 --> 00:50:18.889
(According to Hyun Moo, being clumsy is key in fencing.)

1344
00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:22.018
- Here are the next players. 2, 3. - 2, 3.

1345
00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:23.719
(Third player from each team)

1346
00:50:23.719 --> 00:50:24.759
Goodness.

1347
00:50:25.228 --> 00:50:27.259
(Attacker Jang Hoon is up next.)

1348
00:50:27.429 --> 00:50:29.728
- Put the balloons on me. - It's the worst.

1349
00:50:29.728 --> 00:50:31.268
(It's a huge difference in weight.)

1350
00:50:31.268 --> 00:50:33.599
- Eun Hyuk. - I'll attack him in one go.

1351
00:50:33.599 --> 00:50:35.299
Attack him in one go, Eun Hyuk.

1352
00:50:35.369 --> 00:50:36.668
Show how agile you are.

1353
00:50:36.869 --> 00:50:38.268
Someone strong should pull him.

1354
00:50:38.639 --> 00:50:40.308
Can you pull Jang Hoon?

1355
00:50:40.308 --> 00:50:41.338
I'll try.

1356
00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:43.679
Whether I win or not,

1357
00:50:43.679 --> 00:50:45.509
- I'll go forward. - Forward?

1358
00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:47.009
What if I pull them?

1359
00:50:47.509 --> 00:50:48.779
We have no choice.

1360
00:50:48.849 --> 00:50:50.279
Then they'll be pulled.

1361
00:50:50.279 --> 00:50:51.489
What would you like to say?

1362
00:50:51.489 --> 00:50:52.949
Let me warm up.

1363
00:50:53.449 --> 00:50:54.489
Say something.

1364
00:50:54.688 --> 00:50:56.918
- I'll leave you alone. - I will show you...

1365
00:50:57.219 --> 00:50:58.489
the agility of an anchovy.

1366
00:50:58.628 --> 00:51:00.588
I'll make soup out of you.

1367
00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.058
(He gets more scared.)

1368
00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:03.398
Anchovy soup?

1369
00:51:06.128 --> 00:51:07.299
Do you mean broth?

1370
00:51:07.299 --> 00:51:08.538
You brought up anchovy.

1371
00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:10.438
Get ready.

1372
00:51:10.438 --> 00:51:11.909
(It's a giant versus an anchovy.)

1373
00:51:11.909 --> 00:51:12.938
Set.

1374
00:51:12.938 --> 00:51:16.708
(Who will be the winner?)

1375
00:51:16.779 --> 00:51:17.779
Start.

1376
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:21.648
(Let's move forward.)

1377
00:51:23.719 --> 00:51:24.788
(Come on, you weakling.)

1378
00:51:25.188 --> 00:51:26.219
(He dodges.)

1379
00:51:26.918 --> 00:51:28.788
(Jang Hoon pulls the other members.)

1380
00:51:29.788 --> 00:51:31.659
What are you doing?

1381
00:51:31.659 --> 00:51:33.529
(Why are you in my territory?)

1382
00:51:33.688 --> 00:51:34.699
- What are you doing? - What?

1383
00:51:34.699 --> 00:51:35.759
(Anchovy is trapped.)

1384
00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:36.799
- What are you doing? - What?

1385
00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.029
(Let's eat anchovy soup for dinner.)

1386
00:51:40.029 --> 00:51:41.538
What are you doing?

1387
00:51:41.739 --> 00:51:43.239
(What have we done?)

1388
00:51:46.308 --> 00:51:48.179
- I knew it. - He can't come all the way here.

1389
00:51:48.509 --> 00:51:50.009
Yes, we won!

1390
00:51:50.509 --> 00:51:52.449
- Let's cheer. - That was fast.

1391
00:51:52.449 --> 00:51:54.049
- What happened? - Where's the camera?

1392
00:51:54.679 --> 00:51:56.619
There's the camera.

1393
00:51:56.978 --> 00:51:58.518
- There it is. - Hello.

1394
00:51:58.518 --> 00:52:00.918
- Hello. - Long time no see.

1395
00:52:01.259 --> 00:52:03.619
It's a fight between Seong Wu and JR.

1396
00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:05.958
It's called A Cluster.

1397
00:52:06.358 --> 00:52:07.688
Let's find out.

1398
00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.159
You're great, JR.

1399
00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:10.728
(It's messy from the start.)

1400
00:52:10.728 --> 00:52:11.998
Let's go. You can win, JR.

1401
00:52:11.998 --> 00:52:13.128
(He stumbles.)

1402
00:52:13.128 --> 00:52:14.369
(He moves backward without being pulled.)

1403
00:52:14.369 --> 00:52:15.869
- Are you trying to be funny? - No.

1404
00:52:15.938 --> 00:52:16.998
He's so light.

1405
00:52:18.509 --> 00:52:20.639
(Second slapstick)

1406
00:52:20.639 --> 00:52:22.478
(He's a rising star who's weak.)

1407
00:52:22.478 --> 00:52:23.878
He looks like Yoon Suk.

1408
00:52:23.909 --> 00:52:26.049
He might be blown away by a fan.

1409
00:52:26.049 --> 00:52:27.148
Attack him now.

1410
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:29.349
(Popping)

1411
00:52:29.478 --> 00:52:31.489
- Gosh. - What was that?

1412
00:52:31.819 --> 00:52:32.819
What happened?

1413
00:52:33.819 --> 00:52:35.159
(It's Ji Min versus Won Hee.)

1414
00:52:35.159 --> 00:52:37.259
Won Hee, please vote for me.

1415
00:52:37.259 --> 00:52:38.829
(Vote for me, Won Hee.)

1416
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:40.788
Wait, Won Hee.

1417
00:52:41.159 --> 00:52:42.159
Vote for me.

1418
00:52:42.529 --> 00:52:43.728
(He's persistent.)

1419
00:52:44.429 --> 00:52:46.799
That's right. You're doing well, Won Hee.

1420
00:52:49.838 --> 00:52:51.739
(Team Jang Hoon is winning.)

1421
00:52:51.739 --> 00:52:53.608
The unexpected continues.

1422
00:52:53.768 --> 00:52:54.909
My goodness.

1423
00:52:54.909 --> 00:52:56.838
- We have to change. - Won Hee.

1424
00:52:56.838 --> 00:52:57.849
Please vote for me.

1425
00:52:59.079 --> 00:53:00.248
Everyone.

1426
00:53:00.248 --> 00:53:02.049
The last match remains.

1427
00:53:02.748 --> 00:53:04.788
- How did it turn out this way? - This is great.

1428
00:53:04.788 --> 00:53:07.489
How did it happen?

1429
00:53:07.489 --> 00:53:08.719
- Is he good? - He's excellent.

1430
00:53:08.759 --> 00:53:10.688
He was a professional fencing player.

1431
00:53:10.688 --> 00:53:11.728
(He was part of the national team.)

1432
00:53:11.728 --> 00:53:12.728
Jackson.

1433
00:53:12.728 --> 00:53:14.159
- Does he have to pop all three? - Yes.

1434
00:53:14.159 --> 00:53:15.159
(He must pop 3 balloons to win.)

1435
00:53:15.159 --> 00:53:16.299
Goodness.

1436
00:53:17.398 --> 00:53:19.168
- Show us sabre. - Let's go.

1437
00:53:19.168 --> 00:53:20.369
- Show us sabre. - Let's go.

1438
00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:22.398
(He's quick.)

1439
00:53:23.168 --> 00:53:26.139
(His sword moves quickly as the wind.)

1440
00:53:26.168 --> 00:53:27.708
- He got it. - It's over.

1441
00:53:27.768 --> 00:53:29.079
Jin Young.

1442
00:53:29.179 --> 00:53:30.878
Get ready.

1443
00:53:30.878 --> 00:53:32.608
Wait, cheer for me.

1444
00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:33.978
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1445
00:53:33.978 --> 00:53:35.148
The two over there.

1446
00:53:35.648 --> 00:53:37.648
- Do a cheer. - Let's go.

1447
00:53:37.648 --> 00:53:39.989
- Jackson. - You can do it, Jackson.

1448
00:53:40.188 --> 00:53:41.719
I'm sorry,

1449
00:53:41.788 --> 00:53:43.159
but can you start?

1450
00:53:43.159 --> 00:53:44.259
(What's taking so long?)

1451
00:53:44.259 --> 00:53:46.058
- It's annoying. - Jang Hoon.

1452
00:53:46.259 --> 00:53:47.759
- Seriously. - Don't be jealous.

1453
00:53:47.929 --> 00:53:49.228
Leave him be.

1454
00:53:49.228 --> 00:53:50.529
(The score is 3 to 2.)

1455
00:53:50.529 --> 00:53:52.529
Get ready, set.

1456
00:53:53.299 --> 00:53:55.139
(Will Jackson save his team?)

1457
00:53:55.139 --> 00:53:57.469
(Or will Team Jang Hoon win?)

1458
00:53:57.739 --> 00:53:59.409
Start.

1459
00:53:59.708 --> 00:54:00.739
(He advances.)

1460
00:54:01.608 --> 00:54:02.639
(They're startled by his force.)

1461
00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:04.308
- That's good. - Come on, let's go.

1462
00:54:04.679 --> 00:54:05.708
Jackson.

1463
00:54:06.279 --> 00:54:07.679
Jin Young is good too.

1464
00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:08.918
Gosh, Jin Young.

1465
00:54:08.918 --> 00:54:10.279
(Jin Young seems experienced.)

1466
00:54:10.279 --> 00:54:12.588
- That was sharp. - Be careful.

1467
00:54:12.619 --> 00:54:13.719
Got7.

1468
00:54:13.719 --> 00:54:15.719
Their pride is on the line.

1469
00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:16.719
That's right.

1470
00:54:16.819 --> 00:54:18.429
Will it be Jin Young or Jackson?

1471
00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.288
- He crossed the line. - That's good.

1472
00:54:21.699 --> 00:54:23.599
Jin Young is doing his best.

1473
00:54:23.929 --> 00:54:27.469
- He's playing with a professional. - That's right.

1474
00:54:27.469 --> 00:54:29.038
- Jin Young. - What happened?

1475
00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:30.699
What happened?

1476
00:54:31.139 --> 00:54:32.808
Save the balloons.

1477
00:54:32.838 --> 00:54:33.909
He has to put it back on.

1478
00:54:33.969 --> 00:54:35.038
(Pop)

1479
00:54:36.038 --> 00:54:37.739
(A nice attack)

1480
00:54:37.739 --> 00:54:39.378
Put the balloons back on.

1481
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:40.549
Didn't he win?

1482
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:41.579
(Gosh)

1483
00:54:41.949 --> 00:54:42.978
Jin Young?

1484
00:54:45.449 --> 00:54:46.489
(Jin Young?)

1485
00:54:46.588 --> 00:54:48.188
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1486
00:54:48.288 --> 00:54:49.288
Take it easy.

1487
00:54:49.418 --> 00:54:50.958
Are you exhausted?

1488
00:54:51.458 --> 00:54:54.228
Jackson, it might damage your pride.

1489
00:54:54.228 --> 00:54:55.299
(He won't back away.)

1490
00:54:55.299 --> 00:54:57.199
It might damage your pride.

1491
00:54:57.498 --> 00:54:59.429
Jin Young seems quite...

1492
00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:00.869
(He becomes faster.)

1493
00:55:01.699 --> 00:55:03.299
(He jumps about.)

1494
00:55:03.398 --> 00:55:04.398
Good job.

1495
00:55:04.639 --> 00:55:06.569
(He pops a balloon.)

1496
00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:07.978
(That's a professional move.)

1497
00:55:07.978 --> 00:55:09.538
That was amazing.

1498
00:55:09.808 --> 00:55:11.909
- It was great. - We should replay it.

1499
00:55:11.909 --> 00:55:13.579
- He's definitely a professional. - It's like the Olympics.

1500
00:55:13.579 --> 00:55:14.748
- He's a professional. - That was amazing.

1501
00:55:14.849 --> 00:55:16.049
That's good.

1502
00:55:16.049 --> 00:55:17.779
- This is real fencing. - Fencing.

1503
00:55:19.088 --> 00:55:20.088
Here he comes.

1504
00:55:23.418 --> 00:55:25.458
(His reaction speed is incredible.)

1505
00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:27.128
(The score is 1 to 2.)

1506
00:55:27.128 --> 00:55:28.159
You have one left.

1507
00:55:28.299 --> 00:55:29.299
You have one left.

1508
00:55:29.799 --> 00:55:31.128
Finish the game.

1509
00:55:31.299 --> 00:55:32.469
- Let's go. - You have one left.

1510
00:55:32.628 --> 00:55:35.069
Let him pop 1, and pop the last 1.

1511
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:36.069
It's okay.

1512
00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:37.199
(Thud)

1513
00:55:38.239 --> 00:55:40.308
- I'm sorry. - Was that intentional?

1514
00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:43.108
(He attacks him.)

1515
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:45.808
I can't believe him.

1516
00:55:45.808 --> 00:55:46.978
- That's right. - That was smooth.

1517
00:55:47.378 --> 00:55:49.978
You damaged your reputation.

1518
00:55:50.279 --> 00:55:52.188
You damaged your reputation.

1519
00:55:52.188 --> 00:55:53.188
Seriously.

1520
00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:54.659
- That's not right. - Don't do it.

1521
00:55:54.659 --> 00:55:56.058
You get a warning.

1522
00:55:56.058 --> 00:55:57.288
You can't attack him while apologizing.

1523
00:55:57.288 --> 00:55:58.329
How...

1524
00:55:58.858 --> 00:56:01.128
(He makes a sudden attack.)

1525
00:56:01.228 --> 00:56:03.498
Each has one balloon left.

1526
00:56:03.498 --> 00:56:04.869
(Each player has one balloon.)

1527
00:56:04.869 --> 00:56:06.069
You must win.

1528
00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:08.639
(He moves at his full speed.)

1529
00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:10.268
Come on.

1530
00:56:11.909 --> 00:56:13.668
(He kicks his shoe.)

1531
00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:16.009
Move forward.

1532
00:56:16.009 --> 00:56:17.108
Go.

1533
00:56:17.338 --> 00:56:19.608
(A moment of carelessness determines the winner.)

1534
00:56:19.608 --> 00:56:20.748
Will there be a twist?

1535
00:56:20.808 --> 00:56:22.079
No.

1536
00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:25.949
(Which team will win Key Guide?)

1537
00:56:27.958 --> 00:56:29.518
(Jackson's balloon pops.)

1538
00:56:31.759 --> 00:56:34.058
(He's speechless.)

1539
00:56:34.759 --> 00:56:36.228
Good job, Jin Young.

1540
00:56:36.498 --> 00:56:39.628
The result of fencing is...

1541
00:56:39.628 --> 00:56:41.469
Team Jang Hoon wins.

1542
00:56:41.469 --> 00:56:44.268
(Team Jang Hoon obtains Key Guide.)

1543
00:56:47.308 --> 00:56:48.838
I won't give up.

1544
00:56:48.878 --> 00:56:50.878
- You'll find out. - Take a look.

1545
00:56:51.748 --> 00:56:52.909
- I'm sure about Seong Wu. - This one.

1546
00:56:54.179 --> 00:56:56.878
- Which one shall we choose? - This one.

1547
00:56:56.878 --> 00:56:58.389
- What is it? - Okay.

1548
00:56:58.389 --> 00:57:01.088
This is Key Guide that we choose.

1549
00:57:01.088 --> 00:57:02.088
What is it?

1550
00:57:02.259 --> 00:57:06.489
Master Key reveals what happened during Investigation Mission.

1551
00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:08.699
There are better choices.

1552
00:57:08.699 --> 00:57:09.829
It's an excellent choice.

1553
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:11.268
We choose this one.

1554
00:57:11.268 --> 00:57:13.168
We won't look.

1555
00:57:13.168 --> 00:57:14.228
- Don't worry. - Seriously.

1556
00:57:14.228 --> 00:57:15.569
Don't look, Sang Min.

1557
00:57:15.569 --> 00:57:17.338
- It's not visible from here. - Don't look, Hyun Moo.

1558
00:57:17.338 --> 00:57:19.409
- We can't see. - Vote for me, Won Hee.

1559
00:57:20.869 --> 00:57:22.938
Show us the result.

1560
00:57:23.509 --> 00:57:24.648
Let's see.

1561
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:26.608
Seriously?

1562
00:57:27.949 --> 00:57:29.049
Seriously?

1563
00:57:29.378 --> 00:57:31.418
Did anyone accomplish anything?

1564
00:57:31.688 --> 00:57:32.849
Yes.

1565
00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:34.288
(Don't you remember?)

1566
00:57:35.958 --> 00:57:36.989
Right?

1567
00:57:36.989 --> 00:57:38.889
(Two with Master Key won the fencing match.)

1568
00:57:38.889 --> 00:57:40.989
- Be quiet. - Okay.

1569
00:57:42.299 --> 00:57:43.699
- Okay. - Be quiet.

1570
00:57:45.799 --> 00:57:46.799
It's too...

1571
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:48.239
Okay.

1572
00:57:49.639 --> 00:57:50.969
I don't remember who won.

1573
00:57:52.668 --> 00:57:56.009
It said that Master Keys are Rubber Band Fencing and panties.

1574
00:57:56.079 --> 00:57:58.208
They did well with rubber band panties?

1575
00:57:58.208 --> 00:57:59.208
Yes.

1576
00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:03.219
(Seong Wu, Hee Chul, Jang Hoon and Jin Young are winners.)

1577
00:58:03.219 --> 00:58:04.849
Did anyone win?

1578
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:07.188
Are those who won...

1579
00:58:07.188 --> 00:58:08.259
an important hint?

1580
00:58:08.259 --> 00:58:11.889
You can narrow down the possibility.

1581
00:58:12.458 --> 00:58:14.358
- Is it helpful? - Yes.

1582
00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:15.429
Let's go.

1583
00:58:15.429 --> 00:58:16.998
It's time to go.

1584
00:58:17.199 --> 00:58:18.728
Did you see it?

1585
00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:20.199
I'll tell you.

1586
00:58:20.199 --> 00:58:21.538
You were bad.

1587
00:58:22.268 --> 00:58:23.299
Did you see it?

1588
00:58:23.639 --> 00:58:25.338
You guys are frustrating.

1589
00:58:25.338 --> 00:58:27.108
Sang Min.

1590
00:58:27.108 --> 00:58:28.679
- Sang Min. - This is frustrating.

1591
00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:30.478
You're a genius.

1592
00:58:31.748 --> 00:58:34.208
You're playing an essential role.

1593
00:58:34.579 --> 00:58:35.779
What am I?

1594
00:58:35.779 --> 00:58:37.889
You're Demon because...

1595
00:58:39.648 --> 00:58:40.989
For...

1596
00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:43.889
the first hint about Master Key,

1597
00:58:43.889 --> 00:58:45.588
- Daniel asked... - The bread is delicious.

1598
00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:46.989
about me.

1599
00:58:47.429 --> 00:58:50.829
Daniel found out who I am.

1600
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:52.799
- That's why he came to me. - Instead of wasting time,

1601
00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:54.569
let's find Angel and Demon.

1602
00:58:54.569 --> 00:58:55.838
I'm Angel.

1603
00:58:55.838 --> 00:58:56.838
(I'm right here.)

1604
00:58:56.838 --> 00:58:58.338
Why do you keep spilling?

1605
00:58:58.409 --> 00:58:59.739
You keep spilling.

1606
00:58:59.739 --> 00:59:01.009
It happens when you get old.

1607
00:59:01.509 --> 00:59:03.079
Why do you think, Jin Young?

1608
00:59:03.409 --> 00:59:06.909
Is your opinion about Sang Min the same?

1609
00:59:07.308 --> 00:59:09.148
Listen, Jin Young.

1610
00:59:09.978 --> 00:59:12.049
You can't be sure of anything.

1611
00:59:12.389 --> 00:59:13.489
I'm serious.

1612
00:59:14.018 --> 00:59:15.918
- Are you worried? - You should be open-minded.

1613
00:59:15.918 --> 00:59:17.759
This is important in life.

1614
00:59:17.989 --> 00:59:19.529
Why go that far?

1615
00:59:19.788 --> 00:59:22.228
The moment you go off-guard,

1616
00:59:22.228 --> 00:59:24.628
your ability to handle a crisis significantly drops.

1617
00:59:24.969 --> 00:59:26.128
This bread is good.

1618
00:59:26.728 --> 00:59:27.799
(What?)

1619
00:59:27.799 --> 00:59:28.898
The white one is more delicious.

1620
00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.699
Stop.

1621
00:59:31.409 --> 00:59:35.938
Who's the person that doesn't need gold as much?

1622
00:59:36.509 --> 00:59:38.308
- You. - Right.

1623
00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:41.009
- Why is he bragging? - That's why he's not the Angel.

1624
00:59:41.009 --> 00:59:42.579
I will tell you one thing.

1625
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:46.049
A rich man is greedier.

1626
00:59:46.248 --> 00:59:47.788
The richer the greedier you are.

1627
00:59:47.989 --> 00:59:50.788
- The richer the greedier you are. - This is not what I meant to say.

1628
00:59:50.788 --> 00:59:52.659
Protecting your wealth is tougher than earning your wealth.

1629
00:59:52.889 --> 00:59:54.529
I'll tell you why I said this.

1630
00:59:55.159 --> 00:59:57.058
I'm the least desperate for gold.

1631
00:59:57.058 --> 01:00:00.969
But I still insist that I am the Angel...

1632
01:00:00.969 --> 01:00:06.268
because I want to share gold with all of you.

1633
01:00:06.268 --> 01:00:09.338
What would I do if I get the gold?

1634
01:00:09.338 --> 01:00:12.049
Then just share your wealth to us.

1635
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:14.079
(Why don't you donate some of your wealth?)

1636
01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:15.748
I'll say the conclusion.

1637
01:00:15.748 --> 01:00:18.049
Sang Min is the Demon, right?

1638
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:20.248
So let's just start finding the Angel.

1639
01:00:20.248 --> 01:00:23.588
You're saying I am either Angel or Demon.

1640
01:00:23.588 --> 01:00:27.259
- Right. - There's 50, 50 percent chance.

1641
01:00:27.759 --> 01:00:30.099
Check if I am the Angel or the Demon.

1642
01:00:30.858 --> 01:00:32.099
He's certainly the Demon.

1643
01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:34.639
I am certain about it.

1644
01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:36.699
You heard me, right?

1645
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:39.708
You just need to see if I am the Angel or the Demon.

1646
01:00:40.438 --> 01:00:41.878
Don't believe anything else people say about me.

1647
01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:43.909
He's certainly one of the two.

1648
01:00:43.978 --> 01:00:47.079
- He is. - You keep saying I am the Demon.

1649
01:00:47.308 --> 01:00:49.378
Just check if I am the Angel or the Demon.

1650
01:00:49.378 --> 01:00:51.449
See who else is there.

1651
01:00:51.449 --> 01:00:54.819
If you lie, you should promote Got7's new album...

1652
01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:56.119
- on social media. - Of course.

1653
01:00:56.389 --> 01:00:58.058
My gut feeling is precise.

1654
01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:01.159
Why are you insisting that I am the Demon?

1655
01:01:01.728 --> 01:01:02.929
- My gut feeling is precise. - Right.

1656
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:04.228
You...

1657
01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:06.869
Why do you insist that I am the Demon?

1658
01:01:06.869 --> 01:01:08.099
(Everyone wants to know.)

1659
01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:09.869
- Are you... - I just know it.

1660
01:01:09.869 --> 01:01:11.338
- one of the two? - No.

1661
01:01:13.239 --> 01:01:15.239
- I know you have the Master Key. - Right.

1662
01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:19.449
I can't tell you who has the other Master Key, but I know.

1663
01:01:20.478 --> 01:01:22.378
I know that that person is the Angel.

1664
01:01:23.049 --> 01:01:25.518
You're 100 percent wrong.

1665
01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:27.119
Did you check who the Angel is?

1666
01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:28.119
You are.

1667
01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:29.889
I can't say it in front of the Demon.

1668
01:01:29.989 --> 01:01:32.728
You should talk without me then.

1669
01:01:33.188 --> 01:01:35.659
When I was here last time,

1670
01:01:36.358 --> 01:01:39.128
I kept saying I was the Angel, but people didn't believe me.

1671
01:01:40.469 --> 01:01:44.639
But the person who talk logically...

1672
01:01:44.739 --> 01:01:46.268
and insist being the Angel...

1673
01:01:46.268 --> 01:01:47.739
is certainly the Demon.

1674
01:01:51.648 --> 01:01:55.978
Jin Young is my greatest enemy today.

1675
01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:57.079
Jin Young is.

1676
01:01:57.319 --> 01:01:58.949
This is frustrating.

1677
01:01:59.748 --> 01:02:02.518
I think it could be Seong Wu too.

1678
01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:05.529
- He's just like me from last time. - But he insists he got an X.

1679
01:02:05.858 --> 01:02:07.389
- So I am not sure. - He might be lying.

1680
01:02:07.628 --> 01:02:08.929
Wait. Who said that?

1681
01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:11.628
Jin Young said Seong Wu didn't have the Master Key.

1682
01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:14.369
(Wait.)

1683
01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:16.869
Does Seong Wu have the Master Key?

1684
01:02:17.268 --> 01:02:19.168
It's not Seong Wu.

1685
01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:24.478
(Jin Young insisted that Seong Wu doesn't have the Master Key.)

1686
01:02:25.449 --> 01:02:27.009
Jin Young might be lying.

1687
01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.518
(Can they trust Jin Young's words?)

1688
01:02:28.518 --> 01:02:32.518
It might be a lie that Seong Wu doesn't have the Master Key.

1689
01:02:32.788 --> 01:02:33.889
(Did Jin Young tell the truth?)

1690
01:02:33.889 --> 01:02:35.358
This is why I am confused.

1691
01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.458
I did that because...

1692
01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:41.898
I kept insisting to go with the last one because...

1693
01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:44.058
I won the fencing game.

1694
01:02:44.429 --> 01:02:46.369
I am the winner, you know?

1695
01:02:46.569 --> 01:02:48.969
- The one I am suspicious of is JR. - You don't have the Master Key.

1696
01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:50.599
You don't have the Master Key.

1697
01:02:51.308 --> 01:02:53.509
- Why do you keep lying? - Will you do this to me?

1698
01:02:53.608 --> 01:02:55.409
- Hey. - I am...

1699
01:02:55.409 --> 01:02:57.779
- You have to tell me the truth. - I am telling the truth.

1700
01:02:57.779 --> 01:02:59.409
- But I know the truth. - Are you the Bell of Truth?

1701
01:02:59.679 --> 01:03:00.808
I know.

1702
01:03:02.049 --> 01:03:05.049
He thinks he's better because he's been on this show a few times.

1703
01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:07.449
- No. - We have to unite.

1704
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:09.558
Look.

1705
01:03:10.058 --> 01:03:12.489
Do you think I came here to win gold?

1706
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:15.998
Chan Yeol said the same thing.

1707
01:03:15.998 --> 01:03:17.998
Is it because we are from the same agency?

1708
01:03:19.369 --> 01:03:21.168
You have to trust me, Ji Min.

1709
01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:23.268
- You have to trust me. - Are you saying you're the Angel?

1710
01:03:23.268 --> 01:03:24.338
(What is the truth?)

1711
01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:25.768
But you're not going to believe me even if I say it?

1712
01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:28.579
Your eyes are full of lies.

1713
01:03:28.579 --> 01:03:29.679
- I... - There they are.

1714
01:03:29.679 --> 01:03:31.679
(The Angel is here.)

1715
01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.308
You hyenas.

1716
01:03:34.308 --> 01:03:35.518
You saw what I did.

1717
01:03:35.518 --> 01:03:37.648
I haven't done much though.

1718
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:40.049
- You're not it. - You're not the Angel.

1719
01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:42.518
- You're so mean. - You're not.

1720
01:03:43.058 --> 01:03:45.228
It's certain that you're not. So be smart about who you ally with.

1721
01:03:46.288 --> 01:03:47.998
I am serious. Look at my eyes.

1722
01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:50.398
Who did he play against?

1723
01:03:50.398 --> 01:03:52.628
- I played against JR. - JR.

1724
01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.699
- He won, right? - I won.

1725
01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:56.199
And I popped one.

1726
01:03:56.438 --> 01:03:57.498
- Remember that I won. - Don't come near us.

1727
01:03:57.498 --> 01:03:58.569
I won.

1728
01:03:58.569 --> 01:03:59.768
Maybe it's Seong Wu?

1729
01:03:59.768 --> 01:04:01.239
There's no one to trust.

1730
01:04:01.978 --> 01:04:03.079
The Demon or the Angel?

1731
01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:04.978
(Does Seong Wu have the Angel's Master Key?)

1732
01:04:05.949 --> 01:04:09.549
(Investigation Mission 3)

1733
01:04:10.378 --> 01:04:12.449
- This is the last game. - All right, everyone.

1734
01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.319
- We have to see. - Wait.

1735
01:04:14.319 --> 01:04:16.018
I'm sorry. Hold on.

1736
01:04:16.288 --> 01:04:18.188
- We are all gathered here. - Right.

1737
01:04:18.429 --> 01:04:20.029
I will use this chance to say this for the last time.

1738
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:21.128
I am the Angel.

1739
01:04:21.498 --> 01:04:23.099
I will tell you for the last time.

1740
01:04:23.199 --> 01:04:24.869
This is not how you do it.

1741
01:04:24.869 --> 01:04:28.338
You blew away the last chance.

1742
01:04:28.338 --> 01:04:29.699
You can just ignore what I say.

1743
01:04:29.969 --> 01:04:32.069
- But I gave you the last chance. - Among all the recent guests,

1744
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:33.569
he's the one who doesn't fit in the most.

1745
01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:34.739
I gave you the last chance.

1746
01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.239
He doesn't fit into this show.

1747
01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.639
I gave you the last chance.

1748
01:04:37.639 --> 01:04:38.909
Are you Seo Jang Hoon junior?

1749
01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:41.179
I gave you a chance.

1750
01:04:41.179 --> 01:04:43.279
We won't be needing that last chance.

1751
01:04:43.748 --> 01:04:45.288
Let's make sure to win this time.

1752
01:04:45.288 --> 01:04:47.889
Last game is Ask the Stars.

1753
01:04:47.889 --> 01:04:49.858
(Ask the Stars)

1754
01:04:49.858 --> 01:04:52.088
Ask the stars

1755
01:04:52.259 --> 01:04:55.058
Each team gets six number cards...

1756
01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.699
and six sign cards.

1757
01:04:57.998 --> 01:05:00.998
There is a plus, minus, multiplication, and division sign.

1758
01:05:01.268 --> 01:05:03.199
The number cards have numbers on them.

1759
01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.569
You have to combine one number card...

1760
01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.509
with one sign card to get a bigger number.

1761
01:05:08.978 --> 01:05:10.708
There will be a total of six rounds.

1762
01:05:11.179 --> 01:05:13.378
The team that wins more becomes the ultimate winner.

1763
01:05:14.179 --> 01:05:15.748
So you have to get a bigger number.

1764
01:05:16.878 --> 01:05:18.989
- You can deduct or divide. - This is fun.

1765
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:22.319
- This is... We have to win it. - This is fun.

1766
01:05:22.989 --> 01:05:24.989
The one who gets a bigger number wins.

1767
01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:27.058
It's the Pokemon battle.

1768
01:05:27.159 --> 01:05:28.799
Just give us the random ones.

1769
01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:30.259
1 white one and 2 black ones.

1770
01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.699
(They divide the cards.)

1771
01:05:31.699 --> 01:05:33.369
It's random.

1772
01:05:33.469 --> 01:05:34.799
- Just take whatever you want. - We will take these.

1773
01:05:34.938 --> 01:05:36.799
- Give it to them. - It's randomly selected.

1774
01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.409
- There's no Angel here. - We should've distributed well.

1775
01:05:38.608 --> 01:05:39.708
We got a big one.

1776
01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:40.768
All right.

1777
01:05:40.768 --> 01:05:42.139
- Please open the envelopes. - Gather up.

1778
01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:43.308
Gather up.

1779
01:05:43.308 --> 01:05:45.849
So each team has...

1780
01:05:45.849 --> 01:05:46.949
So this is how it is.

1781
01:05:47.509 --> 01:05:49.179
(Team Jang Hoon got numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.)

1782
01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:50.279
- You can see it, right? - Minus.

1783
01:05:50.449 --> 01:05:52.188
This is good.

1784
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:53.719
It's all about the timing.

1785
01:05:53.989 --> 01:05:57.588
That's the strongest one. We have to hope theirs is a weak one.

1786
01:05:57.889 --> 01:06:00.259
We don't know when that would be. We have to be careful.

1787
01:06:00.429 --> 01:06:04.199
I think we should give up the first two rounds.

1788
01:06:04.498 --> 01:06:06.829
- We have to plan the combinations. - Yes.

1789
01:06:07.329 --> 01:06:09.668
Let's see the highest number we can come up with.

1790
01:06:09.838 --> 01:06:12.469
The highest number we can make is...

1791
01:06:13.268 --> 01:06:15.338
Let's use this one.

1792
01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:17.679
When you start a game like this,

1793
01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:20.108
you usually start with a low number at first.

1794
01:06:20.378 --> 01:06:21.619
That's how people usually play it.

1795
01:06:21.619 --> 01:06:23.719
But we should play with a big number from the start.

1796
01:06:23.719 --> 01:06:24.788
Okay.

1797
01:06:25.719 --> 01:06:27.549
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1798
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:28.659
- All right. - Cheers.

1799
01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:30.119
Go, Pokemon.

1800
01:06:30.518 --> 01:06:31.728
This is Round One.

1801
01:06:31.728 --> 01:06:33.228
Lower the white card.

1802
01:06:33.429 --> 01:06:35.699
- This is fun. - The cards are down.

1803
01:06:35.799 --> 01:06:37.159
- Let's see. - It's the left one.

1804
01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:39.498
- Put down the sign card. - I played this a long time ago.

1805
01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:41.369
All right.

1806
01:06:41.768 --> 01:06:43.239
On the count of three, please flip the cards.

1807
01:06:43.239 --> 01:06:46.338
1, 2, 3.

1808
01:06:46.909 --> 01:06:48.708
(Team Jang Hoon 6, Team Hyun Moo 6)

1809
01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.108
Both teams got the number six.

1810
01:06:51.409 --> 01:06:52.549
- My goodness. - No way.

1811
01:06:53.108 --> 01:06:55.478
It means both teams think the same.

1812
01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:56.549
- Right. - All right.

1813
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:59.188
Let's check the sign cards.

1814
01:07:01.489 --> 01:07:04.759
The sign cards. 1, 2, 3.

1815
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:06.088
Let's see.

1816
01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:07.628
3.

1817
01:07:07.628 --> 01:07:10.259
(Team Jang Hoon wins.)

1818
01:07:13.398 --> 01:07:14.768
They used the strong one.

1819
01:07:14.768 --> 01:07:16.038
- Okay. - It's 1 to 0.

1820
01:07:16.038 --> 01:07:17.469
Theirs is "multiply by 3", and ours is "plus 2".

1821
01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:19.808
- Right. - Is there "multiply by 4" too?

1822
01:07:19.808 --> 01:07:21.608
What signs do we have?

1823
01:07:21.608 --> 01:07:23.438
(How did Team Jang Hoon see through Sang Min's tactic?)

1824
01:07:23.438 --> 01:07:25.279
- Sang Min is very good at this. - Yes.

1825
01:07:26.679 --> 01:07:28.748
Sang Min understands people's psychology well.

1826
01:07:29.179 --> 01:07:33.049
He might think we are going to give up the first few rounds.

1827
01:07:33.288 --> 01:07:38.529
(They figured out Sang Min's tactic and decided to go head-on.)

1828
01:07:38.989 --> 01:07:41.199
The numbers were 18 and 8.

1829
01:07:41.959 --> 01:07:43.159
Come here.

1830
01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:44.428
(They have an emergency meeting.)

1831
01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:46.369
That was the biggest number they had, right?

1832
01:07:46.869 --> 01:07:49.968
We would've lost even if we gave our biggest number.

1833
01:07:49.968 --> 01:07:51.039
- We would've lost anyway. - Right.

1834
01:07:51.039 --> 01:07:52.709
They used up their biggest number.

1835
01:07:53.008 --> 01:07:55.978
They're going to give the lowest number this time.

1836
01:07:55.978 --> 01:07:58.508
Let's go with something in the middle.

1837
01:07:58.749 --> 01:07:59.808
That one.

1838
01:08:00.478 --> 01:08:01.779
Let's win with this one.

1839
01:08:01.779 --> 01:08:03.048
Isn't it too small?

1840
01:08:03.048 --> 01:08:04.048
Then...

1841
01:08:04.048 --> 01:08:06.348
Now...

1842
01:08:06.619 --> 01:08:07.789
Isn't it better?

1843
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:08.789
They will use a big number.

1844
01:08:09.058 --> 01:08:10.858
- So should we use this one? - Yes.

1845
01:08:10.858 --> 01:08:12.029
Okay.

1846
01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:13.659
- All right. - The game is on.

1847
01:08:13.659 --> 01:08:15.159
- Come on out. - Round Two.

1848
01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:16.758
- All right. - Put it down first.

1849
01:08:16.758 --> 01:08:18.098
- Put it down. - Let's go, Ji Min.

1850
01:08:18.098 --> 01:08:21.699
Sang Min confidently chose the cards.

1851
01:08:22.268 --> 01:08:23.798
- Let's see. - All right.

1852
01:08:23.798 --> 01:08:27.508
I know your plan.

1853
01:08:27.608 --> 01:08:29.579
So I can reveal our cards with confidence.

1854
01:08:29.579 --> 01:08:32.409
- Yes. All the team members... - 1, 2, 3.

1855
01:08:33.648 --> 01:08:34.718
Three.

1856
01:08:35.548 --> 01:08:37.018
It's 1 and 4.

1857
01:08:39.848 --> 01:08:40.919
Should we reveal the sign cards?

1858
01:08:40.919 --> 01:08:42.589
1, 2, 3.

1859
01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.489
(What are the sign cards?)

1860
01:08:45.489 --> 01:08:47.058
1, 2, 3.

1861
01:08:47.358 --> 01:08:48.398
Let's get it.

1862
01:08:48.398 --> 01:08:49.829
Okay.

1863
01:08:50.228 --> 01:08:52.669
- Let's get it. - Okay.

1864
01:08:52.768 --> 01:08:54.869
Sang Min is a genius.

1865
01:08:56.199 --> 01:08:58.768
- Ours was 4 subtracted by 1. - Sang Min.

1866
01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:00.808
- Theirs was 1 subtracted by 2. - We were just getting rid of them.

1867
01:09:01.008 --> 01:09:03.138
He predicted it and planned accordingly.

1868
01:09:03.678 --> 01:09:05.449
(He saved good cards and won with a small number.)

1869
01:09:05.449 --> 01:09:07.548
Sang Min is amazing.

1870
01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:11.218
I think we should use this.

1871
01:09:11.388 --> 01:09:13.289
- This? - We can use this on Round Four.

1872
01:09:13.848 --> 01:09:15.518
We have the advantage.

1873
01:09:15.758 --> 01:09:18.629
The score is 1 to 1, but we have the big numbers.

1874
01:09:18.959 --> 01:09:20.928
They used six...

1875
01:09:20.989 --> 01:09:23.558
- and 2. - They don't have 6 anymore.

1876
01:09:23.558 --> 01:09:24.629
(Will they attack with a big number or win with another small number?)

1877
01:09:24.629 --> 01:09:26.029
Let's see.

1878
01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:28.268
Hurry up.

1879
01:09:28.268 --> 01:09:30.499
When will you be done, Won Hee?

1880
01:09:30.999 --> 01:09:32.409
- Are you still not done? - We are nearly done.

1881
01:09:32.409 --> 01:09:33.938
Just tell her you love her.

1882
01:09:34.369 --> 01:09:35.879
- Tell her to vote for me. - Just tell her you love her.

1883
01:09:35.879 --> 01:09:37.608
Tell her to vote for me.

1884
01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:39.209
- Just ask for her number. - I'm sick of it.

1885
01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:40.848
- Tell her you love her. - Let's win with these.

1886
01:09:41.079 --> 01:09:43.478
Let's win with these cards.

1887
01:09:43.518 --> 01:09:44.648
Okay.

1888
01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:45.819
Seong Wu.

1889
01:09:45.888 --> 01:09:47.048
It won't be easy.

1890
01:09:47.048 --> 01:09:48.089
(Daniel versus Seong Wu)

1891
01:09:48.089 --> 01:09:49.459
- Let's get it! - Let's get it!

1892
01:09:49.489 --> 01:09:51.459
This round is important.

1893
01:09:52.129 --> 01:09:53.858
This round is important. This round is important.

1894
01:09:53.858 --> 01:09:55.629
- This round is important. - This round will decide who wins.

1895
01:09:55.629 --> 01:09:56.999
- Here we go. - Flip the white card first.

1896
01:09:57.129 --> 01:09:59.768
- It's already Round Three. - 1, 2, 3.

1897
01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:01.898
1, 2, 3.

1898
01:10:02.438 --> 01:10:03.739
(Team Jang Hoon 5, Team Hyun Moo 8)

1899
01:10:03.739 --> 01:10:05.638
- This round is important. - It's 8 to 5.

1900
01:10:05.638 --> 01:10:06.739
This round is important.

1901
01:10:07.008 --> 01:10:08.409
I trust you, Sang Min.

1902
01:10:08.409 --> 01:10:10.178
1, 2, 3.

1903
01:10:10.178 --> 01:10:13.308
(Which sign cards did they use?)

1904
01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:16.919
1, 2, 3.

1905
01:10:18.319 --> 01:10:19.319
(Team Jang Hoon +3, Team Hyun Moo +1)

1906
01:10:19.319 --> 01:10:20.848
Yes!

1907
01:10:20.848 --> 01:10:23.258
(Team Hyun Moo wins.)

1908
01:10:23.258 --> 01:10:25.529
- It's 8 and 9. - It's over.

1909
01:10:25.629 --> 01:10:27.258
- It's over. - It's over.

1910
01:10:27.258 --> 01:10:29.298
- The game is over. - You can relax now.

1911
01:10:29.829 --> 01:10:31.029
The game is over.

1912
01:10:31.058 --> 01:10:33.268
Sang Min is back.

1913
01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.669
- He's unbelievably clever. - He's scary.

1914
01:10:35.739 --> 01:10:37.138
Relax now.

1915
01:10:37.138 --> 01:10:38.339
- We've done it. - You're unbelievable.

1916
01:10:38.339 --> 01:10:40.308
I think he should write a book like "The Art of War."

1917
01:10:40.308 --> 01:10:42.209
He's too good.

1918
01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:44.339
- Will you be fine? - Have confidence.

1919
01:10:44.438 --> 01:10:47.048
- This is our trump card. - Let's go.

1920
01:10:47.048 --> 01:10:48.518
- Let's go. - We will go with this one.

1921
01:10:48.518 --> 01:10:50.218
- Be confident. - 1, 2, 3.

1922
01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:51.789
We will end it.

1923
01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:53.089
It's 2 and 3.

1924
01:10:53.089 --> 01:10:54.659
We have a surprise card.

1925
01:10:54.659 --> 01:10:56.319
1, 2, 3. Reveal the card.

1926
01:10:56.319 --> 01:10:58.129
We are going to win happily.

1927
01:10:58.159 --> 01:11:00.029
Minus 2. It's 0.

1928
01:11:00.428 --> 01:11:01.459
Okay.

1929
01:11:01.798 --> 01:11:04.499
(Both teams get 0.)

1930
01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.069
(It's a tie.)

1931
01:11:06.069 --> 01:11:07.199
- We won. - Don't be upset.

1932
01:11:07.428 --> 01:11:08.499
Relax now.

1933
01:11:08.499 --> 01:11:10.699
- We have one strong one. - Yes.

1934
01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:12.739
- Isn't it this one? - Are these the two?

1935
01:11:12.839 --> 01:11:14.638
Then we should go with this one.

1936
01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:16.608
It's over if we lose.

1937
01:11:16.608 --> 01:11:18.008
- Let's go with this one. - Okay.

1938
01:11:18.079 --> 01:11:19.308
- All right. - It's okay.

1939
01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:20.379
(They're at the edge of the cliff now.)

1940
01:11:20.379 --> 01:11:22.079
We can use any of these now.

1941
01:11:22.079 --> 01:11:23.348
We can relax now.

1942
01:11:23.348 --> 01:11:25.319
But let's win one more time.

1943
01:11:25.319 --> 01:11:26.989
Let's win. Let's get it over with.

1944
01:11:26.989 --> 01:11:28.058
(They are very confident that they're going to win.)

1945
01:11:28.058 --> 01:11:30.089
All right. Won Hee is playing next.

1946
01:11:30.089 --> 01:11:31.489
- No. It's 2 to 1 now. - What's this?

1947
01:11:31.489 --> 01:11:32.489
(Round 5)

1948
01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:33.629
We will...

1949
01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:35.298
end the game here.

1950
01:11:35.298 --> 01:11:36.829
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1951
01:11:37.129 --> 01:11:38.669
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1952
01:11:39.199 --> 01:11:41.098
We have 5, and you have 7.

1953
01:11:41.739 --> 01:11:44.039
All right.

1954
01:11:44.039 --> 01:11:45.339
1, 2, 3.

1955
01:11:45.339 --> 01:11:46.339
Let's get it.

1956
01:11:46.339 --> 01:11:48.138
(Team Jang Hoon 7, Team Hyun Moo 5)

1957
01:11:48.678 --> 01:11:51.478
(Will Team Jang Hoon win and extend the game?)

1958
01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:52.548
Let's get it.

1959
01:11:53.148 --> 01:11:55.119
- We got it. - 7 times 2 is 14. 5 times 2 is 10.

1960
01:11:56.148 --> 01:11:57.779
(No way.)

1961
01:11:57.779 --> 01:11:58.919
(Team Jang Hoon wins.)

1962
01:11:58.919 --> 01:12:00.119
We lost.

1963
01:12:00.148 --> 01:12:01.558
- I didn't know they had those. - We don't...

1964
01:12:01.558 --> 01:12:03.459
We don't make a fuss.

1965
01:12:03.718 --> 01:12:05.159
It's 2 to 2 now.

1966
01:12:05.659 --> 01:12:07.728
They had another "multiply by 2" card.

1967
01:12:07.728 --> 01:12:09.398
(Nobody knows who will win now.)

1968
01:12:09.398 --> 01:12:11.199
I didn't see that coming.

1969
01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:13.499
- What do we do? - We've been too impatient.

1970
01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.438
We've been impatient.

1971
01:12:15.438 --> 01:12:16.798
- We have one more round. - We should go with this one.

1972
01:12:17.039 --> 01:12:18.608
Let's go.

1973
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:19.739
(Hee Chul versus Eun Hyuk)

1974
01:12:19.739 --> 01:12:21.779
Where did the player go?

1975
01:12:21.779 --> 01:12:24.308
Come on. Bring it on.

1976
01:12:24.949 --> 01:12:26.379
Okay.

1977
01:12:26.478 --> 01:12:27.749
- All right. - Okay.

1978
01:12:27.749 --> 01:12:29.048
- Okay. - What did he say?

1979
01:12:29.048 --> 01:12:30.249
Come this way.

1980
01:12:30.819 --> 01:12:32.888
Let's go. Let's end it here.

1981
01:12:32.989 --> 01:12:34.289
- Let's go! - Let's flip the white card.

1982
01:12:34.289 --> 01:12:35.858
1, 2, 3.

1983
01:12:35.858 --> 01:12:38.329
- Let's go. - Let's start small.

1984
01:12:38.329 --> 01:12:39.959
That's it.

1985
01:12:39.959 --> 01:12:41.598
- We did it. - 4 and 3.

1986
01:12:41.598 --> 01:12:42.928
- Flip the black card. - 1, 2, 3.

1987
01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:45.569
(The last sign cards are revealed.)

1988
01:12:45.569 --> 01:12:47.798
(There's nothing they can do now.)

1989
01:12:47.798 --> 01:12:50.199
(Which team will get the last Key Guide?)

1990
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:53.308
- We did it. - 4 and 3.

1991
01:12:53.308 --> 01:12:54.678
- Flip the black card. - 1, 2, 3.

1992
01:12:56.909 --> 01:13:00.478
(Team Hyun Moo -3, Team Jang Hoon +2)

1993
01:13:00.478 --> 01:13:04.048
(Team Jang Hoon wins.)

1994
01:13:04.048 --> 01:13:06.018
We won.

1995
01:13:06.619 --> 01:13:08.589
Minus 3 and plus 2.

1996
01:13:08.589 --> 01:13:09.589
(We completely lost.)

1997
01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:11.858
They said Sang Min was a genius,

1998
01:13:11.858 --> 01:13:13.989
but they lost.

1999
01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:15.928
You said we were going to win.

2000
01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:17.659
We won.

2001
01:13:18.199 --> 01:13:20.768
All right. We won.

2002
01:13:20.768 --> 01:13:22.699
We lost.

2003
01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:23.798
(Team Jang Hoon gets the last Key Guide.)

2004
01:13:24.398 --> 01:13:25.869
Jang Hoon is unbelievable.

2005
01:13:26.039 --> 01:13:28.478
It's all right. We were happy while playing it.

2006
01:13:29.079 --> 01:13:31.978
We were happy while playing it.

2007
01:13:31.978 --> 01:13:33.379
We won all games.

2008
01:13:33.379 --> 01:13:34.548
(Team Jang Hoon wins all the games.)

2009
01:13:34.548 --> 01:13:36.449
Should I have an exorcism to get rid of the bad luck?

2010
01:13:37.888 --> 01:13:40.319
That team got the hint...

2011
01:13:40.319 --> 01:13:41.589
and confirmed it.

2012
01:13:41.919 --> 01:13:44.188
You have to pick me.

2013
01:13:44.188 --> 01:13:46.159
- Are you really the Angel? - That way you can get the gold.

2014
01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:47.428
- Are you really the Angel? - I am really the Angel.

2015
01:13:47.428 --> 01:13:49.829
Do you want me to say something? I am the Angel too.

2016
01:13:50.358 --> 01:13:51.968
I need to persuade everyone.

2017
01:13:53.829 --> 01:13:56.268
This is the only time I have to persuade people.

2018
01:13:56.839 --> 01:13:58.069
What are you?

2019
01:13:58.069 --> 01:13:59.138
Who are you going to vote for?

2020
01:13:59.909 --> 01:14:01.478
I am the Angel.

2021
01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:04.579
- Sang Min... - I'll be right there.

2022
01:14:04.579 --> 01:14:05.648
- is the Demon. - Hey.

2023
01:14:06.148 --> 01:14:08.119
- Eun Hyuk, if the shoot ends... - You don't have to think.

2024
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.879
You can check me.

2025
01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:13.548
Can you check two people?

2026
01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:17.789
Then you can check me and Sang Min.

2027
01:14:17.928 --> 01:14:19.188
Sang Min is the Demon.

2028
01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.228
(Seong Wu persistently insists that he's the Angel.)

2029
01:14:20.228 --> 01:14:21.758
- You have to recognize me and... - Are you really the Angel?

2030
01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:23.699
You have to share it with... Yes. I am really the Angel.

2031
01:14:23.699 --> 01:14:26.869
It will say O. When it does, share it with everybody.

2032
01:14:26.869 --> 01:14:29.138
And support me.

2033
01:14:29.138 --> 01:14:32.508
Vote me as the Angel and take the key.

2034
01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:37.438
- We will check it. - Yes. You have to check.

2035
01:14:37.438 --> 01:14:39.909
You have to check me. You must check me this time.

2036
01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:42.218
I told you so many times, and you didn't check.

2037
01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.379
I won't give up.

2038
01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:46.348
You have to check. Check me.

2039
01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:48.819
I am explaining this to you...

2040
01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:50.319
because you don't seem to trust me.

2041
01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.329
(They don't believe him at all.)

2042
01:14:51.329 --> 01:14:52.358
Of course we don't trust you.

2043
01:14:52.358 --> 01:14:53.388
- It's like talking to a wall. - How can we...

2044
01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:55.459
How can we trust you?

2045
01:14:55.459 --> 01:14:57.459
I can't trust you at all.

2046
01:14:57.829 --> 01:14:58.999
There's no reason to trust you.

2047
01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:00.499
It's like shouting to a wall.

2048
01:15:00.499 --> 01:15:01.869
You will see once you check me.

2049
01:15:01.869 --> 01:15:03.369
I won't give up.

2050
01:15:03.369 --> 01:15:04.398
(Will the other players check his identity?)

2051
01:15:04.638 --> 01:15:06.008
I won't give up until the end.

2052
01:15:07.768 --> 01:15:09.138
(It's their last chance to get hints.)

2053
01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:10.608
Pay attention.

2054
01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:14.819
We will use the third Key Guide...

2055
01:15:14.819 --> 01:15:16.178
That's very important.

2056
01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:18.489
We will write down the names of the players...

2057
01:15:18.489 --> 01:15:20.949
whose identity we want to check.

2058
01:15:21.489 --> 01:15:25.928
The crew will complete the sentence which would give us a hint.

2059
01:15:26.558 --> 01:15:31.728
But both sentences could be true or false.

2060
01:15:31.968 --> 01:15:33.129
They will give you two sentences,

2061
01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:34.499
- but one of them is true. - No. Either both are true...

2062
01:15:34.499 --> 01:15:35.499
- or both are false. - False.

2063
01:15:35.499 --> 01:15:36.798
All right.

2064
01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:37.909
Is this the truth?

2065
01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:39.869
Then...

2066
01:15:40.508 --> 01:15:41.839
(We already know that Sang Min has the Master Key.)

2067
01:15:41.839 --> 01:15:43.478
We have to form the sentence.

2068
01:15:43.478 --> 01:15:44.709
Let's put down Sang Min's name.

2069
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:47.978
- Let's put down Sang Min's name. - Yes.

2070
01:15:48.279 --> 01:15:49.419
We have to write one other person's name then.

2071
01:15:49.419 --> 01:15:51.218
Then they will say if it's true or false.

2072
01:15:51.289 --> 01:15:52.589
Do we just have to put down the name?

2073
01:15:52.589 --> 01:15:53.919
- It's either O or X. - Who's the Angel?

2074
01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.258
There are too many number of cases then.

2075
01:15:55.888 --> 01:15:57.619
- Right. - Right.

2076
01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.129
- When we write down the names... - They will tell us.

2077
01:15:59.129 --> 01:16:00.459
- Seong Wu. - Seong Wu.

2078
01:16:00.459 --> 01:16:01.558
Seong Wu.

2079
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:04.999
What if we get an O and an X?

2080
01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:07.199
- Both are problematic. - They are checking Seong Wu.

2081
01:16:07.999 --> 01:16:09.669
- I know. - We will know then.

2082
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:10.768
(Are they checking Seong Wu?)

2083
01:16:11.539 --> 01:16:12.608
(They decide to check Seong Wu.)

2084
01:16:12.608 --> 01:16:13.638
Okay.

2085
01:16:14.468 --> 01:16:17.178
When we get the answer, we will know.

2086
01:16:17.178 --> 01:16:18.279
Right.

2087
01:16:18.379 --> 01:16:19.379
Why do that?

2088
01:16:19.379 --> 01:16:21.819
- We are done. - We will check Seong Wu.

2089
01:16:21.819 --> 01:16:23.379
We already have it.

2090
01:16:23.379 --> 01:16:25.388
- So we... - Come here.

2091
01:16:25.388 --> 01:16:26.589
Did they take it?

2092
01:16:26.589 --> 01:16:27.789
They took it.

2093
01:16:27.789 --> 01:16:29.688
Let's check their faces.

2094
01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:32.829
(Among all the players who claimed to be the Angel,)

2095
01:16:32.829 --> 01:16:35.029
(Seong Wu got chosen in the end.)

2096
01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:36.499
(Is Seong Wu the other one with the Master Key?)

2097
01:16:36.499 --> 01:16:38.329
Let's see their faces.

2098
01:16:40.999 --> 01:16:42.239
- That's it. - It's over.

2099
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:45.409
(It said both Sang Min and Seong Wu have the Master Key.)

2100
01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:51.209
(I told you!)

2101
01:16:51.379 --> 01:16:52.978
- We did it. - We did it.

2102
01:16:52.978 --> 01:16:54.449
We did it.

2103
01:16:54.548 --> 01:16:57.178
We did it.

2104
01:16:57.178 --> 01:16:58.218
(Daniel, I am sorry I lied that I was the Angel.)

2105
01:16:58.218 --> 01:17:00.949
(Now Seong Wu can say what happened.)

2106
01:17:01.489 --> 01:17:03.188
Is this key the Master Key?

2107
01:17:03.188 --> 01:17:04.289
(He asked the question.)

2108
01:17:04.289 --> 01:17:07.129
Seong Wu doesn't have it.

2109
01:17:07.129 --> 01:17:10.199
(This Key is the Master Key.)

2110
01:17:10.199 --> 01:17:12.869
Did you see him closing it hastily?

2111
01:17:12.869 --> 01:17:14.268
Why did you close it so quickly?

2112
01:17:14.869 --> 01:17:16.499
I was too happy.

2113
01:17:18.739 --> 01:17:21.879
(Seong Wu has the Master Key.)

2114
01:17:22.508 --> 01:17:23.579
(Jin Young was neither the Angel nor the Demon.)

2115
01:17:23.579 --> 01:17:26.108
At first, I kept insisting that I was the Angel,

2116
01:17:26.749 --> 01:17:28.079
but I didn't do a good job.

2117
01:17:28.548 --> 01:17:31.348
From what I've seen, I think Seong Wu is the Angel.

2118
01:17:31.388 --> 01:17:33.489
Sang Min is the Demon.

2119
01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:36.819
Seong Wu is acting like the Angel.

2120
01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.129
I am certain about it.

2121
01:17:38.289 --> 01:17:39.629
Are you really the Angel?

2122
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:42.129
You have to trust me until the end.

2123
01:17:42.728 --> 01:17:43.928
You have to trust me.

2124
01:17:44.798 --> 01:17:46.398
Can you dance for me then?

2125
01:17:46.398 --> 01:17:47.999
You are...

2126
01:17:48.098 --> 01:17:49.569
What are you doing?

2127
01:17:49.569 --> 01:17:50.839
Jackson asked me to do it.

2128
01:17:50.839 --> 01:17:52.138
It's not the time to dance.

2129
01:17:52.138 --> 01:17:54.108
Jackson begged me.

2130
01:17:54.108 --> 01:17:57.279
How can you dance when you lost three times?

2131
01:17:57.779 --> 01:17:59.909
You have to trust me. Even if it's just you.

2132
01:18:00.379 --> 01:18:04.619
- I trust all of you. You did well. - You helped us a lot.

2133
01:18:04.718 --> 01:18:05.718
All right.

2134
01:18:05.718 --> 01:18:07.319
You have all the hints now.

2135
01:18:07.319 --> 01:18:09.358
It's the last chance.

2136
01:18:09.358 --> 01:18:10.459
Let's go to the Room of Fate.

2137
01:18:10.459 --> 01:18:13.489
(It's time for the Room of Fate.)

2138
01:18:14.728 --> 01:18:15.728
(You trust me, right, Hee Chul?)

2139
01:18:15.728 --> 01:18:18.569
You trust me, right, Hee Chul?

2140
01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:20.869
I am so happy. I'm relieved.

2141
01:18:20.869 --> 01:18:23.239
I was so happy when everyone clapped.

2142
01:18:23.239 --> 01:18:24.709
(This is how happy you get once you've been proven.)

2143
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:25.909
I was so happy.

2144
01:18:26.909 --> 01:18:28.478
You are getting fooled.

2145
01:18:28.808 --> 01:18:29.909
(He's the only person who believes Sang Min.)

2146
01:18:29.909 --> 01:18:31.808
- You're getting fooled. - Really?

2147
01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:33.749
Yes. You are getting fooled by Seong Woo.

2148
01:18:34.348 --> 01:18:37.178
Just know that you are...

2149
01:18:37.178 --> 01:18:39.388
getting fooled by Seong Woo the Demon.

2150
01:18:39.388 --> 01:18:42.119
Seong Woo is the Demon,

2151
01:18:42.119 --> 01:18:44.459
and I am the Angel. You're being fooled.

2152
01:18:44.558 --> 01:18:45.888
Please be clever.

2153
01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:47.789
I won't be fooled.

2154
01:18:48.499 --> 01:18:50.898
I am the Angel. You are getting fooled by him.

2155
01:18:50.898 --> 01:18:52.199
Please be clever.

2156
01:18:52.369 --> 01:18:53.829
- I am being clever. - Right.

2157
01:18:55.169 --> 01:18:57.438
- Really. - Why am I the only one though?

2158
01:18:58.438 --> 01:18:59.669
It's because you're naive.

2159
01:18:59.669 --> 01:19:01.339
I won't be naive anymore then.

2160
01:19:01.839 --> 01:19:03.409
(I can't believe this naive boy is all I have.)

2161
01:19:03.409 --> 01:19:05.279
They're getting fooled.

2162
01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:08.048
- Seong Wu is fooling them. - Really?

2163
01:19:08.048 --> 01:19:10.379
They are completely fooled.

2164
01:19:10.518 --> 01:19:12.489
- You're not lying, right? - I am not.

2165
01:19:12.489 --> 01:19:13.688
I was once...

2166
01:19:14.048 --> 01:19:15.289
tricked by Chan Yeol.

2167
01:19:15.289 --> 01:19:18.188
I'm serious. I felt bad...

2168
01:19:19.029 --> 01:19:20.428
when I made you suffer from it.

2169
01:19:20.428 --> 01:19:21.959
(I never want to recall that memory.)

2170
01:19:22.428 --> 01:19:25.228
We can only try it. It's a 50-50 chance.

2171
01:19:26.029 --> 01:19:28.598
My team wearing white...

2172
01:19:28.598 --> 01:19:30.699
had Angel,

2173
01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:33.268
but never found it and became a group of idiots.

2174
01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.108
You wearing black...

2175
01:19:35.108 --> 01:19:37.879
won the game 3 times and won 3 chances,

2176
01:19:37.879 --> 01:19:40.209
but the fact you couldn't find Angel...

2177
01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:41.249
makes you idiots.

2178
01:19:41.718 --> 01:19:44.218
I'll show you that we're not idiots.

2179
01:19:45.619 --> 01:19:46.648
Seong Wu.

2180
01:19:47.348 --> 01:19:48.858
If it's not true...

2181
01:19:48.858 --> 01:19:50.989
It has to be true. It has to be.

2182
01:19:50.989 --> 01:19:53.529
It can't possibly be. It has to be.

2183
01:19:54.188 --> 01:19:56.758
- It's frustrating. - You're the biggest frustration.

2184
01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:57.968
It's frustrating.

2185
01:19:57.968 --> 01:20:00.029
Then now...

2186
01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.169
(Election begins.)

2187
01:20:01.169 --> 01:20:04.508
write the name of the person you think is Angel.

2188
01:20:05.909 --> 01:20:07.739
(Master Key owners are Ong Seong Wu and Lee Sang Min.)

2189
01:20:07.739 --> 01:20:09.539
- Do I put it inside? - Yes.

2190
01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.579
Please vote.

2191
01:20:12.148 --> 01:20:14.148
I'll trust the person I'm writing down.

2192
01:20:14.148 --> 01:20:15.779
I've already trusted that person.

2193
01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:19.188
I have all the evidence.

2194
01:20:19.449 --> 01:20:21.858
(Vote ends.)

2195
01:20:22.489 --> 01:20:25.758
Ladies and gentlemen. Ong Seong Wu is...

2196
01:20:26.058 --> 01:20:28.598
- You succeeded. - Lee Sang Min.

2197
01:20:28.598 --> 01:20:30.199
We all succeeded.

2198
01:20:30.199 --> 01:20:32.329
Everyone who voted me succeeded.

2199
01:20:32.329 --> 01:20:33.598
- Sure. - Please.

2200
01:20:33.598 --> 01:20:35.369
(Will Ong Seong Wu get the most votes to open the box?)

2201
01:20:35.369 --> 01:20:36.468
I trust you.

2202
01:20:36.468 --> 01:20:38.869
- Sang Min. - Then now...

2203
01:20:38.869 --> 01:20:40.808
All X should help each other.

2204
01:20:41.239 --> 01:20:43.579
Good job today, everyone.

2205
01:20:43.978 --> 01:20:46.579
Let's reveal the prize box.

2206
01:20:46.579 --> 01:20:49.218
(Here comes the prize box.)

2207
01:20:51.919 --> 01:20:55.119
When the key of the person with the most votes turns...

2208
01:20:55.119 --> 01:20:57.758
and the blue light comes on, that key is the Master Key.

2209
01:20:57.959 --> 01:21:00.829
If that key belongs to Devil, it will turn red.

2210
01:21:01.029 --> 01:21:03.298
If a green light comes on, it means the owner's Angel.

2211
01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:06.829
Please reveal the player with the most votes.

2212
01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:08.398
(Here comes the most voted player.)

2213
01:21:08.398 --> 01:21:10.339
We'll tell you with a light.

2214
01:21:10.339 --> 01:21:12.839
(Which player received the most votes?)

2215
01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:16.438
If it's the opposite,

2216
01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.548
- Right. - then we're really...

2217
01:21:19.178 --> 01:21:20.808
Then we're really...

2218
01:21:21.079 --> 01:21:22.379
It'll be the opposite.

2219
01:21:22.379 --> 01:21:25.188
(The most voted player)

2220
01:21:25.188 --> 01:21:26.718
- Ong Seong Wu. - It got to be him.

2221
01:21:27.548 --> 01:21:30.558
- If it's the opposite... - You're all idiots.

2222
01:21:30.589 --> 01:21:32.758
(Is Seong Wu the owner of Angel's Master Key?)

2223
01:21:33.159 --> 01:21:35.728
For what reason? What's your evidence?

2224
01:21:35.829 --> 01:21:37.629
He's talking too much.

2225
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:38.699
(Two Master Key candidates' feelings cross.)

2226
01:21:38.699 --> 01:21:40.669
- What's wrong with him? - Let's do it.

2227
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:43.569
Let's check if Sang Min's right to be upset.

2228
01:21:43.569 --> 01:21:46.468
The most voted, Seong Wu. Please go up.

2229
01:21:47.539 --> 01:21:49.209
Seong Wu keeps smiling.

2230
01:21:49.209 --> 01:21:50.779
- Now. - Look at his face.

2231
01:21:50.779 --> 01:21:52.749
- Hey. - He can't hide it.

2232
01:21:52.749 --> 01:21:54.379
- No. - Wait.

2233
01:21:54.379 --> 01:21:57.949
Is Seong Wu's smile Angel's smile...

2234
01:21:57.949 --> 01:22:00.148
or Devil's smile?

2235
01:22:00.688 --> 01:22:02.688
- He's right. - Isn't he Angel?

2236
01:22:02.688 --> 01:22:04.119
He's Angel.

2237
01:22:04.589 --> 01:22:06.388
Let's trust him.

2238
01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:07.999
- Now. - Great job, Seong Wu.

2239
01:22:07.999 --> 01:22:09.659
- Insert... - Please.

2240
01:22:09.728 --> 01:22:11.058
- your key. - Please.

2241
01:22:11.058 --> 01:22:13.268
- It feels strange. - Whether he's Angel or Devil,

2242
01:22:13.268 --> 01:22:15.499
if he has the Master Key, the light will turn blue.

2243
01:22:15.499 --> 01:22:17.169
- Check... - It's frustrating.

2244
01:22:24.209 --> 01:22:25.249
Master Key.

2245
01:22:25.579 --> 01:22:26.949
- This... - What?

2246
01:22:27.449 --> 01:22:28.518
He has the Master Key.

2247
01:22:31.419 --> 01:22:33.648
It means he's either Angel or Devil.

2248
01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:35.018
It's not determined yet?

2249
01:22:35.018 --> 01:22:37.218
- Now, - Green or red?

2250
01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:38.959
if the light turns green, he's Angel.

2251
01:22:39.129 --> 01:22:40.928
- If it turns red, - Please.

2252
01:22:40.928 --> 01:22:43.228
What are you doing? You're making me nervous.

2253
01:22:43.228 --> 01:22:44.459
(What's the truth behind his smile?)

2254
01:22:45.029 --> 01:22:46.699
He's just enjoying it.

2255
01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:48.298
Did you really act for long?

2256
01:22:48.298 --> 01:22:50.069
Please. I trust you.

2257
01:22:50.069 --> 01:22:51.438
I believe you for the last time.

2258
01:22:51.438 --> 01:22:52.839
Then now...

2259
01:22:53.369 --> 01:22:55.039
- let's check. - Good luck, Ong Seong Wu.

2260
01:22:55.279 --> 01:22:57.279
When I say 1, 2, 3,

2261
01:22:57.279 --> 01:22:58.978
please say "Are you Angel or Demon?"

2262
01:22:58.978 --> 01:23:00.709
I can't watch it.

2263
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:01.749
My gosh.

2264
01:23:01.749 --> 01:23:04.518
Ong Seong Wu. 1, 2, 3.

2265
01:23:04.518 --> 01:23:06.688
- Are you Angel or Demon? - Are you Angel or Demon?

2266
01:23:06.688 --> 01:23:08.758
(What is Seong Wu?)

2267
01:23:13.928 --> 01:23:19.098
(Seong Wu's owner of Demon's Master Key.)

2268
01:23:19.098 --> 01:23:23.369
(No way.)

2269
01:23:23.369 --> 01:23:26.569
(Demon's smile)

2270
01:23:26.569 --> 01:23:27.669
I knew it!

2271
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:30.279
(They fall down automatically.)

2272
01:23:30.279 --> 01:23:32.148
(Demon's Master Key owner wins for the first time.)

2273
01:23:32.148 --> 01:23:34.648
Hey. You. Gosh.

2274
01:23:36.619 --> 01:23:38.919
Why? For what reason?

2275
01:23:38.919 --> 01:23:41.419
He earned 10 votes out of 12.

2276
01:23:41.459 --> 01:23:42.619
10 votes?

2277
01:23:42.619 --> 01:23:44.829
(How did Seong Wu win?)

2278
01:23:45.129 --> 01:23:47.058
Is this key the Master Key?

2279
01:23:47.858 --> 01:23:50.959
Ong Seong Wu and JR are expressionless.

2280
01:23:51.468 --> 01:23:54.739
(Ong Seong Wu's owner of Demon's Master Key.)

2281
01:23:55.369 --> 01:23:56.638
Are you really not the one, Seong Wu?

2282
01:23:56.638 --> 01:23:58.108
(He hid his identity from the beginning,)

2283
01:23:58.108 --> 01:24:01.739
(and appealed that he's Angel.)

2284
01:24:01.938 --> 01:24:04.438
You should trust me and support me.

2285
01:24:04.438 --> 01:24:07.678
(But something...)

2286
01:24:07.678 --> 01:24:11.218
(isn't going right.)

2287
01:24:11.218 --> 01:24:16.959
(No one trusts him.)

2288
01:24:16.959 --> 01:24:19.529
Now's the only time to persuade them.

2289
01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:21.329
Be honest.

2290
01:24:21.329 --> 01:24:25.069
(He persuades his best friend first.)

2291
01:24:25.069 --> 01:24:26.428
(It's 100 percent real.)

2292
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:30.468
(He found Jin Young.)

2293
01:24:30.968 --> 01:24:32.709
I'd never lie to you.

2294
01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:36.808
(He appealed actively to Ko Won Hee and Ji Min.)

2295
01:24:36.808 --> 01:24:38.148
Then we can share.

2296
01:24:38.148 --> 01:24:39.879
I won't give up.

2297
01:24:39.879 --> 01:24:41.379
You can check it yourself.

2298
01:24:42.819 --> 01:24:44.478
(Team Jang Hoon's use of Key Guide...)

2299
01:24:44.478 --> 01:24:47.249
(reveals that he has the Master Key.)

2300
01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:52.659
He received 10 votes out of 12.

2301
01:24:52.659 --> 01:24:53.858
10 votes?

2302
01:24:53.858 --> 01:24:55.428
He persuaded people one by one.

2303
01:24:55.428 --> 01:24:57.329
- Ong Seong Wu. - I knew he'd do it.

2304
01:24:57.329 --> 01:24:59.329
But we must give him an applause since he succeeded.

2305
01:24:59.329 --> 01:25:00.569
Hey, Ong Seong Wu.

2306
01:25:00.699 --> 01:25:02.169
I got deceived again.

2307
01:25:04.268 --> 01:25:06.239
- Who's Angel then? - Hold on.

2308
01:25:06.239 --> 01:25:07.879
- Is it Sang Min? - Is it Sang Min?

2309
01:25:07.879 --> 01:25:09.709
- I'm sorry. - Sure.

2310
01:25:09.909 --> 01:25:11.279
Sang Min.

2311
01:25:11.678 --> 01:25:13.579
You didn't feel like Angel at all.

2312
01:25:13.579 --> 01:25:15.048
- Actually... - What was your plan?

2313
01:25:15.048 --> 01:25:18.518
I thought if I focus on...

2314
01:25:18.518 --> 01:25:20.589
Ko Won Hee, Jackson, and Kang Daniel...

2315
01:25:20.589 --> 01:25:22.419
I thought I'd receive at least five votes.

2316
01:25:22.858 --> 01:25:25.688
Is this key the Master Key?

2317
01:25:26.058 --> 01:25:28.428
(Your key is Angel's Master Key.)

2318
01:25:29.358 --> 01:25:32.768
(He checked his key is Angel's Master Key.)

2319
01:25:34.369 --> 01:25:38.239
(He started arguing that he's Angel.)

2320
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:44.039
(He persuaded people...)

2321
01:25:44.039 --> 01:25:45.449
(and even yelled at them.)

2322
01:25:46.008 --> 01:25:47.449
Are you Demon?

2323
01:25:48.048 --> 01:25:49.749
(He appears to be Demon.)

2324
01:25:50.148 --> 01:25:51.548
(He even sang to persuade people,)

2325
01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.249
(but Jin Young persuaded everyone...)

2326
01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:55.888
(that he's Angel and Sang Min's Demon.)

2327
01:25:55.919 --> 01:25:57.188
He's Demon.

2328
01:25:57.289 --> 01:25:59.888
- Stop it now. - Since it says you're either...

2329
01:26:00.058 --> 01:26:04.258
(He's been everywhere with players,)

2330
01:26:05.329 --> 01:26:08.468
(but players don't even look at him because they fell for Jin Young.)

2331
01:26:10.039 --> 01:26:12.709
(He failed to earn votes.)

2332
01:26:15.508 --> 01:26:16.709
I failed.

2333
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:17.779
Gosh.

2334
01:26:18.879 --> 01:26:20.709
- Is that real gold? - It is.

2335
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:22.218
It's the biggest reward.

2336
01:26:22.819 --> 01:26:24.688
Inside the reward box,

2337
01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:27.148
there are three golden keys.

2338
01:26:27.858 --> 01:26:30.459
We'll give you multiplied by 10.

2339
01:26:32.159 --> 01:26:33.159
(A total of 30 golden keys earned.)

2340
01:26:33.159 --> 01:26:34.629
He's the best actor.

2341
01:26:35.029 --> 01:26:36.129
It was fun though.

2342
01:26:36.129 --> 01:26:37.928
- Good job. - It was fun.

2343
01:26:38.169 --> 01:26:39.669
It was shocking.

2344
01:26:40.468 --> 01:26:41.968
How did you do that?

2345
01:26:41.968 --> 01:26:43.239
(Ong Seong Wu wins at last.)

2346
01:26:44.938 --> 01:26:48.438
(Young men and women visit a phone booth in Master Village.)

2347
01:26:48.678 --> 01:26:56.548
(Are you Angel?)

2348
01:26:56.548 --> 01:26:57.678
(Angel, my foot.)

2349
01:26:58.319 --> 01:27:00.348
(Angel ability test one: driving)

2350
01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:02.358
(Tough road)

2351
01:27:02.358 --> 01:27:03.358
(Stop, stop.)

2352
01:27:03.358 --> 01:27:04.659
(Keep driving.)

2353
01:27:04.659 --> 01:27:05.659
(I don't have a license.)

2354
01:27:05.659 --> 01:27:07.029
My gosh, Suk Jin.

2355
01:27:07.029 --> 01:27:09.129
(Angel ability test two: game intelligence)

2356
01:27:09.129 --> 01:27:10.728
(He never spoke after that.)

2357
01:27:11.728 --> 01:27:13.598
(How to be Angel even if you can't do those things?)

2358
01:27:13.598 --> 01:27:17.239
(Deceive yourself and your friend.)

2359
01:27:17.239 --> 01:27:19.468
(You must deceive everyone...)

2360
01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:20.968
(to be Angel.)

2361
01:27:20.968 --> 01:27:23.178
- Are you Angel or Demon? - Are you Angel or Demon?

2362
01:27:23.478 --> 01:27:24.978
(Be quiet, Ong Seong Wu.)

2363
01:27:24.978 --> 01:27:26.709
(Master Key)
