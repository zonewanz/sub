00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.520
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.249
Prosecutor Jung.

3
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.059
What is it, Mr. Choi?

4
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.559
I think we should request a travel ban for Lawyer Lee.

5
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.690
A travel ban?

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.200
I got here with Lawyer Lee's car.

7
00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:25.669
Get in, Mr. Choi.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.969
I saw luggage in his backseat.

9
00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:33.340
After this trial,

10
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.210
he might run away to some foreign country.

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.109
Doesn't it take a few days to get an approval on the ban?

12
00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:41.749
We can get it approved today if it's an urgent request.

13
00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:42.779
Just a moment.

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.389
We have to get a travel ban for Lawyer Lee.

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.159
I swear...

16
00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.169
according to my conscience, I will only tell the truth without lies.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.870
If any lies are found...

18
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.870
I swear to get punished for perjury.

19
00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:11.010
Well, prosecutors please start on your interrogation.

20
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.049
Yes, Your Honor.

21
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.249
Witness, you were the first one to arrive at the rooftop of...

22
00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:19.019
Hae Kwang Law Firm on the night of the incident, right?

23
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.689
Yes, that is correct.

24
00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:23.389
Could you describe the moment you had just arrived?

25
00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:24.719
Yes.

26
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.930
When I got there,

27
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.529
The defendant, Yu Beom, was crying and stumbling while carrying Hong Joo.

28
00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:36.470
I saw two umbrellas wide open from a distant view.

29
00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:38.339
Were there any others on the roof?

30
00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:41.070
No, nobody was there.

31
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.079
The following photographs are evidence 1 and 2.

32
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.889
The umbrella handles in the photos had the fingerprints of both...

33
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.230
The fact that she brought these two umbrellas to the roof,

34
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.859
it shows her intent to return later with the defendant, Lee Yu Beom.

35
00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.459
she wanted to come back with Lee Yu Beom later on.

36
00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.470
This means Lee Yu Beom murdered Ha Ju Won who had no intent to kill.

37
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.339
This also contradicts to his claim on self-defense.

38
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.470
Please insist...

39
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.579
that the umbrella was found on the first floor, not the rooftop.

40
00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.179
State that the umbrella may not be the same one the witness saw.

41
00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.419
The witness with us here today...

42
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.950
is a policeman who reached the scene first and see the situation.

43
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.030
The umbrella he saw on the rooftop and the one from the first floor...

44
00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:36.959
could be identified as the same by the witness.

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.929
Witness, tell us about the umbrella.

46
00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.570
One was very long.

47
00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.570
The other was short and foldable.

48
00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.910
What were the colors?

49
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.919
How will you testify if you don't run away?

50
00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.329
Are you going to hide that you are color-blind?

51
00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.329
If they find out that you're lying,

52
00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.000
you'll get punished for perjury.

53
00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.329
I won't perjure myself.

54
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.299
Are you going to tell them that you're color-blind?

55
00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.669
Then you have to quit your job as a policeman.

56
00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.179
Witness, why can't you tell us about the colors of the umbrellas?

57
00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:23.209
(Witness stand)

58
00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:29.919
Witness.

59
00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:32.350
What were the colors of the umbrellas?

60
00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:42.560
I...

61
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.500
cannot differentiate color well.

62
00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.250
A policeman who is color-blind?

63
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.680
What is this all about?

64
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.889
Woo Tak, what are you doing?

65
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.889
This is going to get you in trouble.

66
00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:10.789
How can he be a policeman when he is color-blind?

67
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.889
Game over.

68
00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.329
Witness. You're...

69
00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.200
Yes, I am a policeman.

70
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.099
Being color-blind means I'm not eligible for my job.

71
00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:28.209
As soon as my witness testimonial is over,

72
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.180
I will submit the letter of resignation.

73
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.149
What is going on?

74
00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:34.310
Woo Tak...

75
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.820
What is the witness saying?

76
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.990
Quitting your job to testify for this?

77
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.089
- How can a policeman do this? - Resignation?

78
00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:44.760
- This is unbelievable. - Why now?

79
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.190
Keep going with your interrogation, Prosecutor Jung.

80
00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:08.209
Witness, can you describe the umbrellas you saw that night?

81
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.680
Your Honor, even a regular person wouldn’t be able to remember...

82
00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.019
the umbrellas he saw at night within few seconds.

83
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.260
Moreover, the witness can't differentiate colors.

84
00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:22.360
It's not that I can't see it. I see it differently.

85
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.729
Instead of identifying colors differently from regular people,

86
00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.170
I can identify light and shades better than regular people.

87
00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:31.740
So my ability to see at night is much better than normal people.

88
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.810
Your Honor, we should hear the witness with his full testimonials.

89
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.510
It's never too late to judge then.

90
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.479
Yes, please go ahead.

91
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.450
Witness, what kind of umbrella did you see that night?

92
00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.589
The long umbrella I saw that night...

93
00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:50.560
had a wooden handle.

94
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.760
It was bent like a cane.

95
00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:01.969
The foldable umbrella had a whole cylinder type of handle.

96
00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.200
It had two circles on the handle.

97
00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:07.709
The long umbrella...

98
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.250
was the same color as the defendant's necktie color.

99
00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:14.979
The foldable umbrella...

100
00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.219
was similar to the color of the front of your robe.

101
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.990
Except it was brighter

102
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.670
- Oh, he's right. - What he's saying is right.

103
00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:35.800
He saw it correctly.

104
00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.039
Are the umbrellas in the photos the same ones you saw that night?

105
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.250
Yes, they are the same ones.

106
00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:24.519
(Episode 31: Goodbye, My Friend)

107
00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:27.690
We'll end the interrogation on the witness here.

108
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.990
We will come back on July 25, at 11am for the final trial.

109
00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:40.700
Goodness, is Lieutenant Han okay?

110
00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.769
I think he just lost his job due to his testimony.

111
00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:51.310
Let's not be awkward.

112
00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:53.909
I'm okay. Let's continue our friendship.

113
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.290
As you know well,

114
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.619
it would be better for you to collect some proof and reasons...

115
00:08:03.619 --> 00:08:05.060
to state that you didn't do it on purpose.

116
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.530
On purpose?

117
00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:09.359
Aren't you going to claim that I am innocent?

118
00:08:10.499 --> 00:08:13.969
I don't think we need to continue pleading self-defense.

119
00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:16.940
Isn't it better to reduce the sentence by a few years?

120
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.640
Lawyer Seo will be joining for your next trial instead of me.

121
00:08:21.979 --> 00:08:23.709
Sir. Sir!

122
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.920
Goodness! You crazy...

123
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.759
I said you should keep your mouth shut.

124
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.729
You should have said you haven't seen anything that night!

125
00:08:42.859 --> 00:08:46.329
You little brat. You can't take back what you said in the court.

126
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.170
I know, sir.

127
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.839
Your parents worked so hard breeding pigs and cows...

128
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.339
to send you to a police academy! The only son in three generations!

129
00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:55.109
I'm not the only son in three generations, sir.

130
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.280
- What? - My parents...

131
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.280
don't live in the countryside either.

132
00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:05.450
They got divorced a long time ago and re-married different people.

133
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.719
Even if I quit my job now, they will be like "Did you quit?"

134
00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:10.589
That will be all.

135
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.030
Woo Tak.

136
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:26.509
Never in my life...

137
00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:29.709
did this badge...

138
00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.879
belong to me.

139
00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:40.820
It was always heavy.

140
00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:45.829
It was tough.

141
00:09:51.499 --> 00:09:52.499
But...

142
00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:56.739
I wanted to bear the weight.

143
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.609
I enjoyed it.

144
00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:04.440
Working with you...

145
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.050
was a pleasant memory for me.

146
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.160
I've had enough.

147
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:27.869
I don't think I should ask for more.

148
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.560
Thank you so much, sir.

149
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:55.300
You little jerk.

150
00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:05.969
You must have struggled a lot.

151
00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:19.650
Goodness.

152
00:11:40.969 --> 00:11:41.979
It will be okay.

153
00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:44.479
It is okay.

154
00:11:46.249 --> 00:11:47.280
It isn't over yet.

155
00:11:53.119 --> 00:11:54.290
(Passport, Boarding pass)

156
00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.989
Yes, right. Lee Yu Beom.

157
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.259
There was a report that he might run away abroad today.

158
00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:04.759
Yes, please set a travel ban immediately.

159
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.940
Just a second.

160
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.310
(Lee Yu Beom's travel ban has been approved.)

161
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:19.550
My darling is perfect in everything.

162
00:12:23.479 --> 00:12:24.619
Are you dating someone?

163
00:12:26.219 --> 00:12:27.619
This is the best time.

164
00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:29.359
Mr. Choi.

165
00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:35.430
We got approval on Lee Yu Beom's travel ban.

166
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:37.729
Oh, really? What a relief.

167
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.469
Thank you for today.

168
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.270
You'll be here for the next trial, right?

169
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.570
Next trial is the final one, right?

170
00:12:46.209 --> 00:12:47.540
Who is demanding the charge?

171
00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.640
Why? You won't come if I do it...

172
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.339
and come if Jae Chan does it? Is it like that?

173
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.180
Yes, it's like that.

174
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.180
Yes, please come. You must come.

175
00:12:56.219 --> 00:12:57.680
Prosecutor Jung will do it.

176
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.089
I will not miss the final one.

177
00:13:00.249 --> 00:13:03.359
Mr. Choi, you're disappointing me.

178
00:13:05.259 --> 00:13:07.729
Well done today, Prosecutor Jung.

179
00:13:31.219 --> 00:13:33.790
Your words today were impressive.

180
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.190
Responsibility and relations on an investigation...

181
00:13:39.589 --> 00:13:40.690
is a prosecutor's?

182
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.229
When I investigated the IV drip serial murder case.

183
00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:50.540
I never wanted a reward for it. You know it well, Mr. Choi.

184
00:13:50.999 --> 00:13:53.369
I believed that Myung Yi Suk was the true criminal.

185
00:13:53.369 --> 00:13:54.839
I wanted to get him no matter what.

186
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.709
That is all.

187
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.550
Yes, I know.

188
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.050
Then why are you doing this to me?

189
00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:05.890
Why would you?

190
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.259
Why are you doing this to me?

191
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.759
Why is everyone so cruelly...

192
00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:17.430
November 20, 1983.

193
00:14:18.869 --> 00:14:20.469
That's your birthday, Lawyer Lee. Right?

194
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.400
Yes.

195
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.540
It's a day that my parents don't even remember,

196
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.070
but you celebrated with me every year.

197
00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:33.209
But did you celebrate with me just to backstab me like this?

198
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.719
It's the same day as my younger brother's.

199
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.920
Your age and your birthday.

200
00:14:46.089 --> 00:14:48.599
So you were special to me.

201
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.229
That is why I'm doing this.

202
00:14:55.969 --> 00:14:58.570
There has been a travel ban set against you.

203
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.869
There is no need for you to go to the airport now.

204
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.609
Did you...

205
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.180
So stop running away.

206
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.349
Not anymore.

207
00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:34.310
You'll only end up getting hurt...

208
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.709
and suffering.

209
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.390
So...

210
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.560
Stop being so stubborn.

211
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.430
Stop hurting others.

212
00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:00.969
Come with me, Guk Hyun.

213
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.650
I will go see Mr. Choi.

214
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.660
Now?

215
00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:26.259
This...

216
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:28.290
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

217
00:16:28.359 --> 00:16:29.799
- I mean... - I will be quick.

218
00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:31.830
Jae Chan! Stop!

219
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:43.039
You'll only end up getting hurt...

220
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.940
and suffering.

221
00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:47.249
Please stop it. Don't get upset.

222
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.519
It's a bit early for leaves to turn red.

223
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.459
I think I've seen this somewhere.

224
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.930
It was about this time of the year.

225
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.969
I knew how fall came because of you.

226
00:18:30.819 --> 00:18:32.789
I thought I would have more time.

227
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.469
No.

228
00:18:49.069 --> 00:18:50.069
Mr. Choi!

229
00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:16.999
Prosecutor Jung...

230
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.370
Prosecutor Jung...

231
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.289
Ambulance! Somebody help to call the ambulance.

232
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:40.920
Please call the ambulance.

233
00:19:40.989 --> 00:19:43.789
- Yes, 911! - I saw a car accident...

234
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:44.819
Mr. Choi.

235
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.489
- Somebody ran him over... - What on earth!

236
00:19:47.489 --> 00:19:49.400
Come after me.

237
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.600
Follow me now!

238
00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:56.299
Prosecutor Jung.

239
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.969
I have something...

240
00:20:01.309 --> 00:20:03.180
I have something to tell you.

241
00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:05.680
Don't talk! The ambulance will be here in a minute.

242
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.779
It's okay. It's fine.

243
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.380
A very long time ago...

244
00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:12.950
13 years ago...

245
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:17.920
I saw this moment in my dream.

246
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.660
In my dream,

247
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.029
You said...

248
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.170
something to me.

249
00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:36.209
Mr. Choi. Mr. Choi.

250
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.580
If you have dreamt about this moment,

251
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.819
don't come and see me.

252
00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:44.950
If you don't meet me, you won't die.

253
00:20:47.219 --> 00:20:48.219
So...

254
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.289
Please don't come after me.

255
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:54.789
You didn't say it like that...

256
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.660
Again.

257
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.900
Say it again.

258
00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:06.940
Hurry.

259
00:21:08.009 --> 00:21:09.680
I don't have much time.

260
00:21:16.279 --> 00:21:17.279
Mr. Choi.

261
00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.390
Goodness.

262
00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.090
Mr. Choi.

263
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:28.959
If I see you again...

264
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.600
I'm the inspector, Choi Dam Dong.

265
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.370
Nice to meet you, I'm Jung Jae Chan.

266
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.840
I didn't recognize you like a fool.

267
00:21:36.999 --> 00:21:38.340
To you...

268
00:21:38.969 --> 00:21:43.279
I'm obnoxious and clumsy.

269
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.150
Can you tell the doctor to bring over all his medical records?

270
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.150
Yes, sir.

271
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.249
Goodness. I have to work late again.

272
00:21:50.249 --> 00:21:52.890
You'll end up working overtime because my unsolved cases pile up.

273
00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.090
Mr. Choi, let's go out check the scene for the Park Jun Mo case.

274
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.259
Check the scene?

275
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.830
Why would you...

276
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:02.100
Why would you...

277
00:22:10.769 --> 00:22:12.239
be the only one to get hurt?

278
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.180
Prosecutor Jung! Don't get there alone! It's dangerous!

279
00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.509
Prosecutor Jung! Prosecutor Jung!

280
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.920
Let's request for assistance!

281
00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:26.690
Goodness. I'm wearing new shoes!

282
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:30.090
You ruin your new shoes because of me...

283
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.559
You suffer mentally and physically because of me.

284
00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:38.100
But... Even so...

285
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.670
If you can still hold on to someone like me,

286
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.809
Come to me.

287
00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:49.309
What will happen if I can't charge this case?

288
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.680
You will be in trouble.

289
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.309
The whole nation will hate you.

290
00:22:55.479 --> 00:22:58.590
I will ask you a lot of questions and learn a lot from you.

291
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:00.890
I...

292
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.690
I...

293
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.930
will respect you a lot.

294
00:23:14.469 --> 00:23:15.499
This is it.

295
00:23:16.569 --> 00:23:18.469
You said it like this.

296
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.350
And that's why the police...

297
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.279
came to you in urgency.

298
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.920
I came here knowing what will happen.

299
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.029
This is my choice.

300
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.430
Don't blame yourself.

301
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.029
Mr. Choi...

302
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.900
Sir...

303
00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.969
Sir...

304
00:23:53.309 --> 00:23:54.709
Blame yourself shortly.

305
00:23:56.209 --> 00:23:57.880
Remember it for a long time.

306
00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.479
You remember that, right?

307
00:24:09.459 --> 00:24:10.489
That's...

308
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.499
That's the son of my boss.

309
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:18.900
Sir...

310
00:24:22.969 --> 00:24:27.440
Sir... Mr. Choi. Don't go...

311
00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:30.940
Please don't go...

312
00:24:31.709 --> 00:24:34.049
Please don't go, Mr. Choi.

313
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.219
Don't go.

314
00:24:46.243 --> 00:24:49.475
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E31 While You Were Sleeping "Goodbye, My Friend"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

315
00:25:02.739 --> 00:25:05.009
Even if life gives you trials,

316
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.410
do not be sad or angry.

317
00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.180
Your heart lives in the future.

318
00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:13.090
Your present is sad.

319
00:25:13.719 --> 00:25:15.319
Everything is a short moment.

320
00:25:15.719 --> 00:25:16.819
What passed...

321
00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.989
and what's passing now...

322
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.330
will be cherished in the future.

323
00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:23.830
What a nice poem.

324
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.769
You scared me!

325
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.170
Hi, I'm hungry.

326
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.969
Let's eat something.

327
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:34.340
Okay. I'll bring you something shortly.

328
00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:41.309
You are not going to do something stupid, right?

329
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.819
I won't go anywhere.

330
00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:44.950
I won't do anything stupid.

331
00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:49.559
My end...

332
00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.059
is not now.

333
00:25:56.959 --> 00:25:58.160
In the future,

334
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:01.569
I have someone to meet.

335
00:26:17.779 --> 00:26:18.890
