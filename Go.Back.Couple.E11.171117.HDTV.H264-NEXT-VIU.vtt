3
00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:14.012
Hey.

4
00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:28.927
Please come quickly.

5
00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:31.916
Ban Do, come quickly.

6
00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.615
I really need to go now.

7
00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:34.916
Please, Detective.

8
00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.556
- Please, I need to go. - Stop it.

9
00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:38.456
Let me go. Let me go!

10
00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:45.295
Why do you do this all the time?

11
00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:53.876
Because of you...

12
00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:56.475
Because of you...

13
00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:59.376
she died before she had a chance to look at me one last time.

14
00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:23.935
Sometimes your heart may get tangled not because it's someone's fault,

15
00:01:25.036 --> 00:01:26.875
but because of a situation.

16
00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:22.056
(Eat.)

17
00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:43.746
I'll use the one spoonful chance.

18
00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:46.655
- Come on. - No.

19
00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:49.116
What's that?

20
00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:51.826
Should I not use it?

21
00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:30.996
Honey.

22
00:03:32.065 --> 00:03:33.165
You're home.

23
00:03:33.935 --> 00:03:35.366
- Yes, I am. - Did you have dinner?

24
00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:36.806
Not yet. I'm hungry.

25
00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:38.806
Go wash up. I'll prepare something.

26
00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:41.236
Okay.

27
00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:43.475
By the way, what should we do for Father's birthday?

28
00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:45.106
Is it his birthday already?

29
00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:46.306
What should we do?

30
00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:47.815
Back then...

31
00:03:48.415 --> 00:03:51.046
instead of ignoring and neglecting our problems...

32
00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:52.845
and relying on the saying "time heals all wounds",

33
00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:55.956
we should have untangled...

34
00:03:55.956 --> 00:03:58.385
our knotted hearts one by one.

35
00:04:04.326 --> 00:04:05.426
Let's get a divorce.

36
00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:08.796
We're too unhappy together.

37
00:04:09.836 --> 00:04:11.635
I am unimaginably unhappy.

38
00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:14.135
Let's get divorced.

39
00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:15.935
Let's get a divorce.

40
00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.046
Let's get divorced!

41
00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:24.685
Before the huge...

42
00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:27.056
tangled ball of yarn swallows us whole...

43
00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:29.085
one day.

44
00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:39.895
(Episode 11: Knotted Hearts Grow When We Ignore and Neglect Them)

45
00:04:51.705 --> 00:04:53.445
(Grapes)

46
00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:55.575
What is this?

47
00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:57.286
Grapes.

48
00:04:57.986 --> 00:04:58.986
I know that.

49
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.226
Why...

50
00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:07.195
am I like this?

51
00:05:10.565 --> 00:05:11.926
Why can't I...

52
00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:17.065
do anything right?

53
00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:20.236
I...

54
00:05:22.075 --> 00:05:24.445
have always been sincere.

55
00:05:26.515 --> 00:05:28.375
I always tried my best.

56
00:05:31.746 --> 00:05:33.486
But like today, 10 years earlier,

57
00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:35.916
everything is a mess.

58
00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:43.825
I've tried so hard...

59
00:05:45.825 --> 00:05:49.195
so that I could lead a happy life.

60
00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:53.335
Why do I always have to be sorry?

61
00:05:54.335 --> 00:05:55.606
Why am I always apologizing?

62
00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:01.246
I missed my mother-in-law...

63
00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:05.716
just as much as you did.

64
00:06:09.156 --> 00:06:12.585
I missed my mother-in-law just as much as you did.

65
00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:36.075
What's this about?

66
00:06:37.145 --> 00:06:38.286
Mom.

67
00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:39.856
Mother-in-law?

68
00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:44.426
You look young,

69
00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:46.825
but you must be married.

70
00:06:50.825 --> 00:06:52.296
Anyway, why are you crying?

71
00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:54.635
And you?

72
00:06:58.306 --> 00:06:59.366
You're not...

73
00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:01.476
How do you know him?

74
00:07:02.906 --> 00:07:05.145
No, it's not what you think.

75
00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:06.546
Come on, Mom.

76
00:07:06.546 --> 00:07:07.746
Don't think anything weird.

77
00:07:08.116 --> 00:07:09.476
It's not like that.

78
00:07:10.486 --> 00:07:12.385
There's nothing between us.

79
00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:16.315
Really, there is nothing.

80
00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.356
It's because...

81
00:07:18.986 --> 00:07:22.056
something bad happened to a friend of his from school.

82
00:07:22.395 --> 00:07:23.496
Right?

83
00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:28.366
Mom, let's go in.

84
00:07:28.466 --> 00:07:29.565
Let's go inside.

85
00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:38.145
Did you eat?

86
00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:42.375
Pardon?

87
00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:48.685
Mom.

88
00:07:48.856 --> 00:07:50.625
Why did you invite him in?

89
00:07:51.455 --> 00:07:53.125
You said he was your friend.

90
00:07:53.996 --> 00:07:55.796
He helped me the other day.

91
00:07:55.796 --> 00:07:58.895
How can I just send him home when it's dinner time?

92
00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:01.065
He said he was hungry too.

93
00:08:16.216 --> 00:08:18.046
Please allow me to marry Jin Joo, sir.

94
00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:19.116
No!

95
00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:22.255
She's still young and has her whole future ahead of her.

96
00:08:22.885 --> 00:08:23.885
Dad.

97
00:08:23.885 --> 00:08:25.356
Let us get married.

98
00:08:25.356 --> 00:08:27.096
We must get married.

99
00:08:27.556 --> 00:08:28.895
There's a reason to get married.

100
00:08:29.395 --> 00:08:30.466
A reason?

101
00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:32.425
You're young. It's not like you're pregnant...

102
00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:36.395
Why you...

103
00:08:37.505 --> 00:08:38.606
You're crazy.

104
00:08:39.066 --> 00:08:40.076
You're insane.

105
00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:41.275
You're crazy.

106
00:08:41.275 --> 00:08:42.275
- You're crazy. - No.

107
00:08:42.275 --> 00:08:43.645
- No! No, it's not that! - You're mad!

108
00:08:43.645 --> 00:08:45.346
Come here, you!

109
00:08:45.346 --> 00:08:47.346
- Hey! - Why did you say that nonsense?

110
00:08:48.675 --> 00:08:50.285
It's not that.

111
00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:53.216
I want to be with him every day.

112
00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:55.316
Why you...

113
00:08:55.486 --> 00:08:56.986
- Gosh. - Mother.

114
00:08:57.055 --> 00:08:58.456
- Mother. - Come out here.

115
00:08:58.456 --> 00:08:59.956
- Just let us get married. - Jin Joo.

116
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.125
No.

117
00:09:01.326 --> 00:09:02.726
- Goodness. - Father.

118
00:09:10.805 --> 00:09:11.936
Mother.

119
00:09:16.545 --> 00:09:17.645
Mother.

120
00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:18.775
This is for you.

121
00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:21.045
You don't have to do this again.

122
00:09:21.216 --> 00:09:22.616
It's okay. You keep it.

123
00:09:22.616 --> 00:09:24.986
You worked hard for this money. Why do you keep giving it to me?

124
00:09:25.086 --> 00:09:27.986
This is why I work hard. It makes me happy...

125
00:09:27.986 --> 00:09:29.356
to give you spending money.

126
00:09:29.686 --> 00:09:30.785
If you don't take this,

127
00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:32.885
I'll be upset.

128
00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:34.826
Goodness.

129
00:09:35.155 --> 00:09:36.226
Okay.

130
00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:38.566
Thank you, Ban Do.

131
00:09:38.696 --> 00:09:39.836
Thank you so much.

132
00:09:39.895 --> 00:09:42.066
- Please keep it a secret. - Okay.

133
00:09:42.066 --> 00:09:43.165
- I got it. - Ban Do.

134
00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:44.805
Yes, Father. I'm coming.

135
00:09:45.436 --> 00:09:46.436
Okay.

136
00:10:10.226 --> 00:10:11.925
Someone up there must've been jealous...

137
00:10:12.525 --> 00:10:14.795
of Eun Sook and my marriage.

138
00:10:15.535 --> 00:10:16.836
If I had known this would happen,

139
00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:19.106
we would've fought a little.

140
00:10:20.035 --> 00:10:21.175
I'm glad...

141
00:10:21.836 --> 00:10:23.905
I have a son-in-law.

142
00:10:24.576 --> 00:10:25.746
I couldn't even cry...

143
00:10:26.616 --> 00:10:28.316
in front of my daughters.

144
00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:38.956
Thank you, Ban Do.

145
00:10:44.925 --> 00:10:45.925
Name?

146
00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:50.106
It's Choi Ban Do.

147
00:10:50.106 --> 00:10:51.106
Age?

148
00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:55.836
I'm 20 years old.

149
00:10:58.375 --> 00:10:59.446
Are you drunk?

150
00:11:00.675 --> 00:11:02.645
- What? - Gosh.

151
00:11:02.645 --> 00:11:03.986
Is this an investigation?

152
00:11:04.385 --> 00:11:06.915
We're eating together because he helped me...

153
00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:10.186
and also because I had misunderstood him.

154
00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:12.586
It's fine.

155
00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:15.655
Don't mind him, and eat up.

156
00:11:16.055 --> 00:11:18.125
This is what we eat on a daily basis,

157
00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.196
so there's not much to eat.

158
00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:21.566
Thank you.

159
00:11:27.635 --> 00:11:29.375
Thank you, Mrs. Go.

160
00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:33.616
I went to the market to cook braised spicy chicken that you like,

161
00:11:33.616 --> 00:11:35.246
but there wasn't any chicken left.

162
00:11:35.246 --> 00:11:38.446
This is more than enough.

163
00:11:38.515 --> 00:11:42.755
If you cook meals like this for me constantly,

164
00:11:44.086 --> 00:11:45.385
I'll come here every day.

165
00:11:47.096 --> 00:11:49.196
He's really good at flattery.

166
00:11:49.196 --> 00:11:51.596
It's not. I mean it.

167
00:11:51.696 --> 00:11:53.895
All right. All right. Eat up.

168
00:11:54.665 --> 00:11:55.696
Thanks.

169
00:12:06.206 --> 00:12:07.216
Jin Joo, here.

170
00:12:14.486 --> 00:12:18.385
My daughters won't eat this if I don't bone the fish for them.

171
00:12:18.385 --> 00:12:21.155
I washed my hands. Is that all right?

172
00:12:23.295 --> 00:12:24.295
Yes.

173
00:12:24.596 --> 00:12:26.125
All right. Eat up.

174
00:12:27.336 --> 00:12:28.736
I missed...

175
00:12:29.336 --> 00:12:32.106
my mother-in-law just as much as you did.

176
00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:36.976
I missed my mother-in-law just as much as you did!

177
00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:45.446
- Why aren't you eating? - What?

178
00:12:45.446 --> 00:12:47.686
Eat slowly, and don't get an upset stomach again.

179
00:12:50.885 --> 00:12:54.525
Mom, it's all right. You should eat this.

180
00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:55.696
You should eat it.

181
00:12:55.696 --> 00:12:57.726
- Mom. - You should eat this too.

182
00:12:57.726 --> 00:12:59.196
- Here. - Gosh.

183
00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:02.035
- Eat up. - Okay.

184
00:13:02.035 --> 00:13:04.035
I can eat on my own.

185
00:13:05.606 --> 00:13:08.035
- I made this recently. - Okay.

186
00:13:11.505 --> 00:13:13.246
Eat up.

187
00:13:13.246 --> 00:13:14.446
- Is it delicious? - Yes.

188
00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:16.275
- Eat. - Eat.

189
00:13:26.755 --> 00:13:28.496
- Thank you for the meal. - You're welcome.

190
00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:31.125
I didn't prepare much today,

191
00:13:31.226 --> 00:13:33.566
but I'll cook something nice if you visit again.

192
00:13:33.566 --> 00:13:34.836
What do you like?

193
00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:36.035
Sorry?

194
00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:38.836
He likes braised spicy chicken.

195
00:13:39.305 --> 00:13:41.905
Braised spicy chicken?

196
00:13:41.905 --> 00:13:43.946
I am really good at it.

197
00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:47.045
You should visit again.

198
00:13:48.515 --> 00:13:49.515
Yes.

199
00:13:57.425 --> 00:14:00.356
Why did you see him out? He's not your son-in-law.

200
00:14:00.356 --> 00:14:01.596
Just.

201
00:14:01.895 --> 00:14:03.525
I've seen him a few times,

202
00:14:03.665 --> 00:14:05.765
but he makes he feel sorry for him whenever I see him.

203
00:14:05.765 --> 00:14:08.265
The way he looks at me...

204
00:14:10.436 --> 00:14:12.936
He looks at me the same way that Jin Joo looks at me recently.

205
00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:14.976
That's bizarre.

206
00:14:15.905 --> 00:14:19.106
Maybe they're seeing each other.

207
00:14:19.346 --> 00:14:21.746
You know the tanned one, right?

208
00:14:21.816 --> 00:14:23.015
I don't like him.

209
00:14:23.015 --> 00:14:26.316
Have you ever liked anyone? Gosh.

210
00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:31.525
Maybe he's my lost son.

211
00:14:34.596 --> 00:14:36.925
Gosh, I can't even joke around you.

212
00:14:41.866 --> 00:14:44.736
Lost son, my foot.

213
00:14:53.846 --> 00:14:57.116
Have you decided to live carelessly now that you've become younger?

214
00:14:58.346 --> 00:14:59.716
What happened?

215
00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:05.986
Why didn't you tell me?

216
00:15:07.226 --> 00:15:08.295
Doctor Park.

217
00:15:10.165 --> 00:15:11.795
You could've been in trouble.

218
00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:14.566
Where did you hear that?

219
00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:17.736
Nothing happened. It's fine.

220
00:15:19.466 --> 00:15:21.135
You were right.

221
00:15:22.535 --> 00:15:23.875
I wasn't there...

222
00:15:25.275 --> 00:15:26.976
whenever you needed me.

223
00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:29.746
You were right.

224
00:15:34.155 --> 00:15:37.086
I thought I was always there to protect you.

225
00:15:40.096 --> 00:15:42.596
I now understand why you were unhappy.

226
00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:49.436
I didn't ask you to protect me.

227
00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:53.375
You didn't need to protect me.

228
00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:56.675
You just had to be by my side.

229
00:15:59.545 --> 00:16:01.946
You didn't need to try to feed me.

230
00:16:02.875 --> 00:16:04.885
You just had to eat with me.

231
00:16:07.086 --> 00:16:08.956
You should have cried with me...

232
00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:11.726
and shared my sorrow.

233
00:16:14.755 --> 00:16:15.925
I'm home.

234
00:16:16.925 --> 00:16:18.096
Guess what I bought for you.

235
00:16:18.665 --> 00:16:21.566
Ta-da! I bought the pork slices that you like.

236
00:16:21.936 --> 00:16:23.135
Stay right there.

237
00:16:23.135 --> 00:16:25.566
I'll change my clothes and prepare it for you.

238
00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:27.576
All right? Stay right there.

239
00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:43.226
Even though it's been a while,

240
00:16:46.996 --> 00:16:49.996
I can't seem to be able to forget it.

241
00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:52.925
I know it wasn't your fault.

242
00:16:53.496 --> 00:16:55.795
I know that you couldn't help it.

243
00:16:59.005 --> 00:17:00.005
That's why...

244
00:17:01.675 --> 00:17:03.946
I tried to stop myself...

245
00:17:04.446 --> 00:17:06.815
whenever I felt like blaming you.

246
00:17:10.545 --> 00:17:12.186
But why did you...

247
00:17:13.486 --> 00:17:15.085
act so carelessly?

248
00:17:16.255 --> 00:17:18.255
Why were you so careless...

249
00:17:21.525 --> 00:17:23.525
to the extent that my sorrow felt like nothing?

250
00:17:30.565 --> 00:17:31.865
That was when it started.

251
00:17:33.005 --> 00:17:34.575
That was when we started growing apart.

252
00:17:36.676 --> 00:17:38.476
You should have looked into me.

253
00:17:39.646 --> 00:17:41.345
You should have hugged me.

254
00:17:45.716 --> 00:17:46.815
You should have...

255
00:17:48.055 --> 00:17:49.255
cried with me.

256
00:17:55.626 --> 00:17:56.696
It's meaningless...

257
00:17:57.795 --> 00:17:58.966
now.

258
00:18:08.976 --> 00:18:10.676
I wanted to make you laugh.

259
00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:14.015
I...

260
00:18:15.015 --> 00:18:17.345
was really sorry to you and your mother.

261
00:18:20.355 --> 00:18:22.115
I couldn't do anything.

262
00:18:25.456 --> 00:18:26.525
I thought...

263
00:18:28.555 --> 00:18:31.426
it was the only thing I could do then.

264
00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:38.035
I didn't want to make you cry.

265
00:18:40.305 --> 00:18:42.005
I wanted to make you laugh.

266
00:18:44.206 --> 00:18:45.376
I just wanted you to laugh.

267
00:18:49.746 --> 00:18:51.015
Why didn't you...

268
00:18:52.486 --> 00:18:54.855
tell me about this earlier?

269
00:19:08.196 --> 00:19:10.765
Gosh, I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

270
00:19:11.206 --> 00:19:12.335
Let's eat.

271
00:19:14.075 --> 00:19:17.676
- Thank you. - Thank you.

272
00:19:25.716 --> 00:19:27.515
Why is the soup so salty?

273
00:19:30.555 --> 00:19:33.355
Why is this salty? It's not.

274
00:19:33.355 --> 00:19:36.795
What are you talking about? I can feel the salt.

275
00:19:45.065 --> 00:19:47.176
Why is the rice so salty?

276
00:19:48.575 --> 00:19:49.636
Wait.

277
00:19:55.716 --> 00:19:57.115
What is this?

278
00:19:57.115 --> 00:19:59.716
Why is my food so salty?

279
00:20:00.486 --> 00:20:02.156
Gosh, woman.

280
00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:07.055
What? What is it now? Why are you angry now?

281
00:20:13.335 --> 00:20:14.795
What wrong with her?

282
00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:16.906
It must have been you.

283
00:20:16.906 --> 00:20:19.706
Think carefully about what you might have done wrong.

284
00:20:20.335 --> 00:20:21.876
You must have some idea.

285
00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:23.775
You've lived with her for 26 years.

286
00:20:23.775 --> 00:20:25.505
I wouldn't know what she was thinking...

287
00:20:25.505 --> 00:20:27.446
even if I lived with her for 100 years.

288
00:20:27.446 --> 00:20:29.785
If you're angry, you need to tell me that you are...

289
00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:32.216
in order for me to know.

290
00:20:33.186 --> 00:20:35.085
You wanted to eat out during lunch,

291
00:20:35.085 --> 00:20:36.825
so we ate outside and all.

292
00:20:36.926 --> 00:20:39.126
Why on earth are you angry?

293
00:20:39.126 --> 00:20:41.726
Tell me what it is. Just say it.

294
00:20:42.956 --> 00:20:44.325
Do I have to spell it out?

295
00:20:46.025 --> 00:20:48.795
Of course. It's not like I can read your mind.

296
00:20:48.795 --> 00:20:50.136
How would I know?

297
00:20:50.136 --> 00:20:53.605
We went out to eat and did everything.

298
00:20:53.636 --> 00:20:56.236
I wanted to eat out because I didn't want to...

299
00:20:56.236 --> 00:20:58.005
eat home cooking.

300
00:20:58.005 --> 00:20:59.005
But...

301
00:20:59.005 --> 00:21:01.345
you took me to a home cooking restaurant,

302
00:21:01.345 --> 00:21:03.246
you cheap old man!

303
00:21:03.246 --> 00:21:05.085
Wait, what?

304
00:21:05.085 --> 00:21:08.315
Then you should've said that you want something else.

305
00:21:08.315 --> 00:21:10.186
You haven't said a word until this moment...

306
00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:12.186
Do I have to spell out every single thing for you?

307
00:21:12.426 --> 00:21:13.996
Are you an idiot?

308
00:21:13.996 --> 00:21:15.226
Of course.

309
00:21:15.496 --> 00:21:17.966
How would I know what's on your mind if you don't tell me?

310
00:21:17.966 --> 00:21:20.396
People say, feelings are meant to be expressed.

311
00:21:20.466 --> 00:21:22.236
What will you do with your mouth?

312
00:21:22.236 --> 00:21:24.136
Is your mouth meant to be used just for eating?

313
00:21:24.206 --> 00:21:26.005
You're unbelievable.

314
00:21:27.305 --> 00:21:29.476
What's gotten into Ban Do recently?

315
00:21:30.105 --> 00:21:31.906
And where on earth is Jae Woo?

316
00:21:34.075 --> 00:21:36.845
This is the problem with men.

317
00:21:37.386 --> 00:21:40.785
They throw out their friends like a useless can when they date.

318
00:21:43.126 --> 00:21:44.255
Hey.

319
00:21:44.255 --> 00:21:45.486
You're a can.

320
00:21:45.986 --> 00:21:47.595
Were you thrown out as well?

321
00:21:47.726 --> 00:21:49.156
Oh, my gosh.

322
00:21:49.996 --> 00:21:51.996
What on earth are you looking at?

323
00:21:54.265 --> 00:21:55.835
- Darn it. - Are you okay?

324
00:21:57.305 --> 00:21:58.565
Who was that?

325
00:21:59.775 --> 00:22:01.605
Go Dok Jae, you.

326
00:22:04.976 --> 00:22:06.275
I'm sorry.

327
00:22:07.515 --> 00:22:09.615
Darn it, why did that hit the fat guy?

328
00:22:11.486 --> 00:22:12.545
Are you insane?

329
00:22:12.545 --> 00:22:14.156
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

330
00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:15.986
What?

331
00:22:15.986 --> 00:22:17.986
Why would I do that to you on purpose?

332
00:22:17.986 --> 00:22:20.226
Darn it, I was already feeling down today.

333
00:22:20.595 --> 00:22:22.226
I should just beat you up!

334
00:22:22.996 --> 00:22:24.065
Be careful.

335
00:22:24.265 --> 00:22:26.095
- I'll kill you. - I'm sorry.

336
00:22:26.196 --> 00:22:27.666
Darn it.

337
00:22:32.365 --> 00:22:33.736
Darn it, you fat pig.

338
00:22:33.736 --> 00:22:35.436
Take this. And this.

339
00:22:42.115 --> 00:22:43.515
You punk!

340
00:22:45.045 --> 00:22:46.146
You're the best.

341
00:22:46.986 --> 00:22:48.416
The best. You're the best.

342
00:22:52.255 --> 00:22:56.325
Go Dok Jae!

343
00:22:59.325 --> 00:23:00.396
You're home.

344
00:23:00.535 --> 00:23:01.666
Yes.

345
00:23:01.696 --> 00:23:03.166
I thought you were seeing him off to the mart.

346
00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:04.335
What took you so long?

347
00:23:07.005 --> 00:23:08.005
Hey.

348
00:23:08.206 --> 00:23:10.005
Did he bring that for us?

349
00:23:10.075 --> 00:23:12.206
Or maybe he forgot to take it.

350
00:23:13.005 --> 00:23:14.115
No.

351
00:23:14.876 --> 00:23:16.075
It's for you.

352
00:23:17.716 --> 00:23:19.146
- Me? - Yes.

353
00:23:32.726 --> 00:23:33.896
I...

354
00:23:34.865 --> 00:23:36.936
was really sorry to you and your mother.

355
00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:38.936
I couldn't do anything.

356
00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:41.605
I didn't want to make you cry.

357
00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:44.805
I wanted to make you laugh.

358
00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:47.815
I just wanted you to laugh.

359
00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:02.095
You should have looked into me.

360
00:24:03.226 --> 00:24:04.626
You should have hugged me.

361
00:24:06.636 --> 00:24:07.795
You should have...

362
00:24:08.065 --> 00:24:09.196
cried with me.

363
00:24:22.146 --> 00:24:23.146
One.

364
00:24:23.585 --> 00:24:24.585
Two.

365
00:24:25.085 --> 00:24:26.115
Three.

366
00:24:26.456 --> 00:24:27.486
Four.

367
00:24:28.055 --> 00:24:29.216
Jae Woo.

368
00:24:30.025 --> 00:24:32.986
If you don't have the talent, you can always quit.

369
00:24:32.986 --> 00:24:34.555
Do you have to do this?

370
00:24:35.555 --> 00:24:37.025
How dare you criticize me?

371
00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:38.426
You aren't any good either.

372
00:24:38.426 --> 00:24:39.865
It's not that, just look at yourself.

373
00:24:39.865 --> 00:24:42.095
Your body isn't fit for this.

374
00:24:42.496 --> 00:24:43.706
Even if you try this for life,

375
00:24:43.706 --> 00:24:44.906
you'll never get it.

376
00:24:45.436 --> 00:24:46.535
What about you?

377
00:24:46.876 --> 00:24:48.275
Go over there, and do it.

378
00:24:48.275 --> 00:24:49.876
You're making me look bad.

379
00:24:50.476 --> 00:24:51.505
Darn it.

380
00:24:52.275 --> 00:24:53.416
Attention, everyone.

381
00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:55.716
Class of '99, gather around.

382
00:24:56.376 --> 00:24:57.585
It's finally...

383
00:24:58.115 --> 00:25:00.555
the time for the National Cheerleading Competition.

384
00:25:03.585 --> 00:25:06.085
The pride of your school is at stake,

385
00:25:06.255 --> 00:25:09.255
so class of '99, make sure you're ready for the competition.

386
00:25:09.525 --> 00:25:10.926
- Yes. - That's all.

387
00:25:14.636 --> 00:25:16.906
Bo Reum, you'll definitely be the center.

388
00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:19.005
Come on.

389
00:25:19.005 --> 00:25:21.176
You didn't have to state the obvious.

390
00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:24.545
This means there will be a fierce competition...

391
00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:26.646
to become your partner to be at the center.

392
00:25:29.376 --> 00:25:31.345
Look, Byeong Gyu. He's good.

393
00:25:32.515 --> 00:25:34.255
Hey, Yong Taek.

394
00:25:34.285 --> 00:25:36.726
He can definitely stand in the center with his talent.

395
00:25:37.126 --> 00:25:38.186
Thanks.

396
00:25:49.236 --> 00:25:50.265
Hey.

397
00:25:50.305 --> 00:25:52.105
Why aren't you mentioning my dear Jae Woo?

398
00:25:52.565 --> 00:25:55.305
He can't even get the basic moves right.

399
00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:56.476
She's right.

400
00:25:56.545 --> 00:25:58.075
He won't even pass the preliminaries.

401
00:25:58.376 --> 00:25:59.775
Work is work.

402
00:25:59.775 --> 00:26:00.845
Hey!

403
00:26:00.845 --> 00:26:02.575
What if he does make it?

404
00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:05.446
Don't judge a book by its cover.

405
00:26:07.456 --> 00:26:08.515
- Okay. - Okay.

406
00:26:13.595 --> 00:26:15.855
Are you sure the director is coming?

407
00:26:15.855 --> 00:26:17.166
Yes, I told you.

408
00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:19.496
Anyway, we should totally embarrass him today.

409
00:26:20.095 --> 00:26:21.236
Okay, then.

410
00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:23.966
A school isn't a playground.

411
00:26:23.966 --> 00:26:25.666
Director Jung must resign.

412
00:26:25.736 --> 00:26:27.376
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

413
00:26:27.376 --> 00:26:28.976
Director Jung must resign.

414
00:26:28.976 --> 00:26:30.605
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

415
00:26:30.605 --> 00:26:32.275
This isn't a school.

416
00:26:32.275 --> 00:26:33.976
Director Jung must resign.

417
00:26:33.976 --> 00:26:35.775
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

418
00:26:35.775 --> 00:26:37.585
A director who ignores...

419
00:26:37.585 --> 00:26:39.146
the will of students must resign.

420
00:26:39.146 --> 00:26:40.815
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

421
00:26:44.055 --> 00:26:45.255
Come, and watch us.

422
00:26:45.255 --> 00:26:46.386
Of course.

423
00:26:46.386 --> 00:26:47.555
Of course, I'll be there.

424
00:26:49.595 --> 00:26:50.795
It's tomorrow.

425
00:26:52.426 --> 00:26:53.535
Park Hyun Seok!

426
00:27:04.805 --> 00:27:06.005
Hey, I'm so sorry.

427
00:27:06.476 --> 00:27:08.845
Something important came up on my way to the show.

428
00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:11.146
I'm sorry.

429
00:27:15.386 --> 00:27:17.226
Don't worry about it. I'm messing with you.

430
00:27:17.226 --> 00:27:18.656
Why would I wait for you?

431
00:27:19.626 --> 00:27:20.926
You didn't wait for me?

432
00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:22.325
I'm not a fool.

433
00:27:22.426 --> 00:27:24.865
Why would I wait for a guy who doesn't even like me?

434
00:27:25.996 --> 00:27:27.166
Goodness.

435
00:27:27.295 --> 00:27:28.496
Look at you.

436
00:27:28.565 --> 00:27:30.436
You aren't denying that.

437
00:27:32.966 --> 00:27:34.505
I just wanted to give it to you.

438
00:27:35.005 --> 00:27:36.075
I mean,

439
00:27:36.305 --> 00:27:38.406
I got a new hobby thanks to you.

440
00:27:39.305 --> 00:27:40.446
I was thankful.

441
00:27:41.876 --> 00:27:43.015
I'm relieved...

442
00:27:43.285 --> 00:27:44.446
That you didn't wait around.

443
00:27:45.446 --> 00:27:47.156
So, did the show go well?

444
00:27:47.355 --> 00:27:48.656
I was really curious about it.

445
00:27:48.956 --> 00:27:50.126
Of course.

446
00:27:50.825 --> 00:27:53.855
Most ballerinas can't stay in the industry for long,

447
00:27:54.396 --> 00:27:55.525
so when it comes time to retire,

448
00:27:55.525 --> 00:27:57.996
they get nervous and depressed.

449
00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:00.666
I figured in about 20 years,

450
00:28:01.396 --> 00:28:02.795
I can do this.

451
00:28:03.865 --> 00:28:05.835
I think that might be a better time for me.

452
00:28:05.835 --> 00:28:07.976
There's always a way out in life.

453
00:28:08.376 --> 00:28:10.575
You'll find something else to do after you retire.

454
00:28:10.805 --> 00:28:12.646
Let's take it easy.

455
00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:14.615
You should take it easy.

456
00:28:15.345 --> 00:28:17.545
You don't even know where your heart is.

457
00:28:17.986 --> 00:28:20.156
Wait, are you trying to ignore it?

458
00:28:21.585 --> 00:28:22.686
What do you mean?

459
00:28:23.156 --> 00:28:25.886
You like that girl, Jin Joo.

460
00:28:26.426 --> 00:28:28.095
I could completely see through you.

461
00:28:28.825 --> 00:28:30.696
You always look at me like you're my dad,

462
00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:33.565
but when you look at her, your eyes turn into hearts.

463
00:28:36.136 --> 00:28:38.365
Hey, you're the only one who has no idea.

464
00:28:42.105 --> 00:28:43.305
Oh, and her, maybe.

465
00:28:48.716 --> 00:28:50.515
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

466
00:28:50.515 --> 00:28:53.916
A director who ignores the will of students must resign.

467
00:28:54.115 --> 00:28:55.716
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

468
00:28:55.716 --> 00:28:57.456
They're protesting.

469
00:28:57.456 --> 00:28:59.055
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

470
00:28:59.055 --> 00:29:00.956
(Director Jung Gi Do must resign.)

471
00:29:01.496 --> 00:29:02.595
The director?

472
00:29:02.855 --> 00:29:04.396
- Director Jung must resign. - Director...

473
00:29:04.565 --> 00:29:06.226
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

474
00:29:06.226 --> 00:29:08.595
Director Jung must resign.

475
00:29:11.236 --> 00:29:12.335
Are you hurt?

476
00:29:12.936 --> 00:29:14.605
Oh, no. I'm fine.

477
00:29:15.535 --> 00:29:17.575
You can go ahead. I need a second.

478
00:29:18.305 --> 00:29:19.406
What's wrong...

479
00:29:24.886 --> 00:29:26.115
She won't give me a chance.

480
00:29:27.115 --> 00:29:28.855
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

481
00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:30.486
Resign, resign!

482
00:29:30.486 --> 00:29:32.126
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

483
00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:33.795
Director Jung must resign.

484
00:29:33.896 --> 00:29:35.726
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

485
00:29:39.095 --> 00:29:40.736
- Resign! - Leave!

486
00:29:41.835 --> 00:29:43.406
- Resign! - Resign!

487
00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:44.805
- Resign! - Resign!

488
00:29:44.805 --> 00:29:46.736
- Leave! - Resign!

489
00:29:46.736 --> 00:29:47.906
- Leave! - Resign!

490
00:29:47.906 --> 00:29:49.075
My goodness, what is he going to do?

491
00:29:49.476 --> 00:29:50.746
Oh, my goodness.

492
00:29:51.075 --> 00:29:52.845
- Resign! - Resign!

493
00:29:52.845 --> 00:29:54.275
- Resign! - Resign!

494
00:29:54.275 --> 00:29:55.615
- Leave! - Resign!

495
00:29:57.716 --> 00:29:58.886
Hey...

496
00:29:59.186 --> 00:30:00.315
Go.

497
00:30:00.416 --> 00:30:02.156
- Resign! - Resign!

498
00:30:02.255 --> 00:30:03.656
- Resign! - Resign!

499
00:30:03.986 --> 00:30:05.226
Don't go near them.

500
00:30:05.555 --> 00:30:07.456
My gosh, what will he do? Just go!

501
00:30:07.855 --> 00:30:09.966
- Resign! - Resign!

502
00:30:09.966 --> 00:30:12.795
Goodness, why are they taking things so far?

503
00:30:13.696 --> 00:30:15.795
His son shouldn't have to see that.

504
00:30:15.795 --> 00:30:17.666
What will he do now?

505
00:30:18.765 --> 00:30:19.876
Goodness.

506
00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:21.605
- Resign! - Resign!

507
00:30:21.605 --> 00:30:24.146
- Resign! - Resign!

508
00:30:25.476 --> 00:30:28.045
- Director Jung must resign. - Resign, resign!

509
00:30:28.045 --> 00:30:31.085
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

510
00:30:31.085 --> 00:30:33.045
- Director Jung must resign. - Resign, resign!

511
00:30:34.456 --> 00:30:35.456
- Goodness. - Resign, resign!

512
00:30:36.115 --> 00:30:38.226
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

513
00:30:39.686 --> 00:30:40.696
Did you eat?

514
00:30:43.926 --> 00:30:44.996
Let's have lunch together.

515
00:30:46.295 --> 00:30:48.295
- Director Jung must resign. - Resign, resign!

516
00:30:48.295 --> 00:30:50.835
- Resign, resign! - Resign, resign!

517
00:30:52.436 --> 00:30:54.005
Goodness.

518
00:31:00.615 --> 00:31:04.345
(Director Jung, we demand explanations.)

519
00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:09.986
How can he hide his feelings so well when he's so young?

520
00:31:14.726 --> 00:31:15.726
Why aren't you eating?

521
00:31:18.365 --> 00:31:19.696
I'll eat yours then.

522
00:31:21.896 --> 00:31:24.636
Sure. Go ahead.

523
00:31:29.005 --> 00:31:31.646
You don't know how to express your feelings, do you?

524
00:31:33.075 --> 00:31:35.716
- What? - You should say you're hurt,

525
00:31:35.716 --> 00:31:39.015
you're sad, and you're angry.

526
00:31:40.015 --> 00:31:42.416
But you don't seem to talk about how you feel.

527
00:31:42.855 --> 00:31:45.886
Nobody can worry about you if you don't.

528
00:31:46.855 --> 00:31:47.855
Why?

529
00:31:48.926 --> 00:31:50.295
Will you start worrying about me?

530
00:31:55.196 --> 00:31:57.105
Nobody worries about me,

531
00:32:00.636 --> 00:32:01.736
so I'm okay.

532
00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:07.476
Goodness.

533
00:32:18.426 --> 00:32:19.726
Go slowly.

534
00:32:19.726 --> 00:32:20.755
What are you doing?

535
00:32:21.595 --> 00:32:23.626
Gosh, can't you stop clinging to me?

536
00:32:23.825 --> 00:32:26.325
- Gosh. - Please shield me.

537
00:32:26.325 --> 00:32:29.636
If that fat brown bear finds me, he'll kill me.

538
00:32:29.636 --> 00:32:32.265
I gave him the finger right to his face.

539
00:32:32.265 --> 00:32:35.075
You crazy punk. You'll be dead soon.

540
00:32:35.706 --> 00:32:36.976
Why are you looking so serious?

541
00:32:37.676 --> 00:32:39.005
Isn't that Jin Joo?

542
00:32:39.005 --> 00:32:40.015
Where?

543
00:32:47.916 --> 00:32:49.615
- Go Dok Jae! - Gosh.

544
00:32:49.615 --> 00:32:50.755
He scared me.

545
00:32:54.656 --> 00:32:57.966
You better kneel down and beg for forgiveness.

546
00:32:57.966 --> 00:33:00.565
That's not the way to... Hey! Don't go!

547
00:33:02.936 --> 00:33:04.865
Ban Do, sit down.

548
00:33:04.865 --> 00:33:07.136
Please save me. Don't go.

549
00:33:07.775 --> 00:33:09.436
Tell him you got a draft notice.

550
00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:12.605
What draft notice? Are you crazy? Hey!

551
00:33:19.246 --> 00:33:21.315
Hi. We have to talk, don't we?

552
00:33:22.855 --> 00:33:26.656
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking back then.

553
00:33:27.726 --> 00:33:28.956
You weren't thinking?

554
00:33:28.956 --> 00:33:32.065
You should've been. Why weren't you thinking?

555
00:33:32.065 --> 00:33:33.736
Well...

556
00:33:33.936 --> 00:33:37.265
I... I got a draft notice.

557
00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:38.305
Draft notice?

558
00:33:38.565 --> 00:33:40.176
No. Not a draft notice...

559
00:33:40.176 --> 00:33:43.075
Well... I...

560
00:33:43.075 --> 00:33:44.575
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:45.976 --> 00:33:47.075
Let's go drink.

562
00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:50.916
Pardon?

563
00:33:56.585 --> 00:33:59.255
If you keep looking at me like that, I'll be attracted to you.

564
00:34:00.456 --> 00:34:04.166
This is called a mother's smile. I'm not trying to attract you.

565
00:34:04.295 --> 00:34:05.396
Got it?

566
00:34:07.595 --> 00:34:08.695
You're really...

567
00:34:09.066 --> 00:34:10.166
Nam Gil.

568
00:34:18.146 --> 00:34:19.246
You're here.

569
00:34:19.246 --> 00:34:21.675
I got here as soon as I got a call from Mr. Kim.

570
00:34:21.675 --> 00:34:22.976
What happened?

571
00:34:23.246 --> 00:34:24.816
Is everything okay?

572
00:34:25.186 --> 00:34:27.385
Yes, he'll be fine.

573
00:34:27.555 --> 00:34:28.816
You can go see him.

574
00:34:29.316 --> 00:34:30.325
Bye.

575
00:34:32.925 --> 00:34:33.956
I wasn't...

576
00:34:34.555 --> 00:34:36.026
asking about your father.

577
00:34:36.226 --> 00:34:37.325
I was asking about you.

578
00:34:42.865 --> 00:34:46.066
I came here because I was worried about you.

579
00:34:48.575 --> 00:34:49.905
Are you okay?

580
00:35:00.686 --> 00:35:02.715
I guess he has two mothers.

581
00:35:04.485 --> 00:35:05.885
But he said he didn't have any.

582
00:35:09.055 --> 00:35:12.526
(Natural Sciences)

583
00:35:12.526 --> 00:35:15.296
647...

584
00:35:16.336 --> 00:35:19.235
647 is...

585
00:35:20.606 --> 00:35:21.606
not here.

586
00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:24.376
Is it on loan?

587
00:35:39.825 --> 00:35:41.055
("Is Everything Determined?" by Stephen Hawking)

588
00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:43.195
Are you looking for this? Time slip?

589
00:35:44.365 --> 00:35:45.796
I was just curious.

590
00:35:48.796 --> 00:35:50.235
I don't think you need to read it.

591
00:35:51.135 --> 00:35:52.765
I read it, and it wasn't useful.

592
00:35:53.376 --> 00:35:54.376
I see.

593
00:35:55.175 --> 00:35:56.976
I was just a bit curious,

594
00:35:56.976 --> 00:35:58.405
but I guess I don't have to read it.

595
00:36:02.075 --> 00:36:03.246
I'll get going then.

596
00:36:03.845 --> 00:36:04.845
Okay.

597
00:36:14.956 --> 00:36:16.695
What? What is it?

598
00:36:20.735 --> 00:36:22.965
Those punks.

599
00:36:24.206 --> 00:36:26.776
Let's just go. Why are we hiding?

600
00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:30.246
It'd be weird to go out now.

601
00:36:30.376 --> 00:36:32.246
Well, I think it's sweet.

602
00:36:33.416 --> 00:36:35.615
Just wait. They'll leave soon.

603
00:36:37.115 --> 00:36:38.115
Goodness.

604
00:37:35.876 --> 00:37:37.106
Hey.

605
00:37:37.106 --> 00:37:39.106
Why aren't you mentioning my dear Jae Woo?

606
00:37:39.305 --> 00:37:41.646
He can't even get the basic moves right.

607
00:37:41.646 --> 00:37:42.816
She's right.

608
00:37:42.816 --> 00:37:44.445
He won't even pass the preliminaries.

609
00:37:45.186 --> 00:37:46.715
Work is work.

610
00:37:55.356 --> 00:37:57.626
Please listen.

611
00:37:57.626 --> 00:38:01.666
(Asura)

612
00:38:04.706 --> 00:38:07.235
I'm not going to do this.

613
00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:10.706
I won't do it. I give up!

614
00:38:15.515 --> 00:38:17.646
I give up. I give up!

615
00:38:22.356 --> 00:38:24.256
Discipline is the most important to a soldier.

616
00:38:24.256 --> 00:38:28.195
As long as you're disciplined, you'll have it easy.

617
00:38:28.456 --> 00:38:30.496
Discipline! I'll keep that in mind.

618
00:38:30.595 --> 00:38:34.695
Dok Jae. Each religion offers different snacks.

619
00:38:34.695 --> 00:38:37.706
Some give you 2 chocolate pies, and some give you 1.

620
00:38:37.706 --> 00:38:39.436
You should keep that in check.

621
00:38:39.436 --> 00:38:42.175
- Yes, sir. - Hey. Just hang in there.

622
00:38:42.336 --> 00:38:45.345
You'll be discharged one day.

623
00:38:46.305 --> 00:38:49.476
Of course. You can't be called a real Korean man...

624
00:38:49.476 --> 00:38:52.215
until you have served in the military.

625
00:38:52.215 --> 00:38:55.456
Gosh, Dok Jae. You're the man.

626
00:38:56.055 --> 00:38:57.425
- Drink up. - Let's drink.

627
00:39:05.325 --> 00:39:08.635
They'll find out soon if I don't join the army.

628
00:39:09.905 --> 00:39:11.506
Should I cut my hair?

629
00:39:12.206 --> 00:39:14.006
No, not my hair.

630
00:39:15.376 --> 00:39:17.006
Well, they didn't kill me today.

631
00:39:17.276 --> 00:39:18.546
I'll worry about it tomorrow.

632
00:39:18.746 --> 00:39:20.845
All right.

633
00:39:21.646 --> 00:39:22.675
Hello?

634
00:39:23.115 --> 00:39:24.746
- Hi, Mom. - Dok Jae.

635
00:39:24.746 --> 00:39:25.885
Your draft notice came in the mail.

636
00:39:25.885 --> 00:39:28.215
What are you talking about? Why so early?

637
00:39:28.215 --> 00:39:29.385
I just turned 20.

638
00:39:29.385 --> 00:39:31.256
It's because you were born in the beginning of the year.

639
00:39:34.695 --> 00:39:35.796
Are you serious?

640
00:39:44.566 --> 00:39:46.265
Dok Jae. Come here.

641
00:39:46.265 --> 00:39:47.675
- Quickly. - Come.

642
00:39:47.976 --> 00:39:49.905
Okay.

643
00:39:49.905 --> 00:39:50.905
There.

644
00:39:55.146 --> 00:39:57.646
I've never seen a guy stay so normal after getting drafted.

645
00:39:57.646 --> 00:39:59.686
- You aren't even crying. - You're right.

646
00:39:59.686 --> 00:40:01.416
Drink up.

647
00:40:18.936 --> 00:40:22.135
It's okay.

648
00:40:39.325 --> 00:40:40.456
I'm going.

649
00:40:40.695 --> 00:40:41.756
Ma Jin Joo.

650
00:40:43.396 --> 00:40:44.425
What?

651
00:40:44.595 --> 00:40:45.996
The ring mark...

652
00:40:46.666 --> 00:40:47.695
Yes?

653
00:40:47.965 --> 00:40:49.265
Since when did you have it?

654
00:40:51.265 --> 00:40:52.506
Since I came here.

655
00:41:04.215 --> 00:41:05.345
Hello.

656
00:41:05.646 --> 00:41:07.055
I'm looking for a ring.

657
00:41:07.055 --> 00:41:08.715
There has to be a line inside.

658
00:41:08.956 --> 00:41:10.026
Is this all you have?

659
00:41:16.256 --> 00:41:18.095
There has to be a line inside.

660
00:41:18.095 --> 00:41:19.526
It's not this one.

661
00:41:21.896 --> 00:41:24.006
Is this all you have?

662
00:41:24.265 --> 00:41:25.405
Hello.

663
00:41:27.706 --> 00:41:28.836
This one?

664
00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:30.046
It's a simple one.

665
00:41:30.046 --> 00:41:31.276
A simple one?

666
00:41:32.445 --> 00:41:33.916
Is this all you have?

667
00:41:36.015 --> 00:41:37.086
Thank you.

668
00:41:39.485 --> 00:41:40.686
This must be it.

669
00:41:41.615 --> 00:41:42.785
Please.

670
00:41:45.086 --> 00:41:47.595
I'm looking for a ring.

671
00:41:48.126 --> 00:41:49.256
The ring...

672
00:41:57.265 --> 00:41:58.336
This looks pretty.

673
00:41:58.506 --> 00:41:59.566
Let's choose this one.

674
00:41:59.566 --> 00:42:00.675
- This one? - Yes.

675
00:42:00.675 --> 00:42:02.135
- Do you want to see this one? - Yes.

676
00:42:10.015 --> 00:42:11.186
Seo Jin.

677
00:42:13.285 --> 00:42:14.385
Seo Jin.

678
00:42:16.555 --> 00:42:17.655
Seo Jin.

679
00:42:20.155 --> 00:42:21.256
Seo Jin.

680
00:42:22.996 --> 00:42:24.166
Were you sleeping?

681
00:42:26.026 --> 00:42:28.666
I'm going out for a walk. I was going to ask you to join me.

682
00:42:28.765 --> 00:42:29.836
You should go back to sleep.

683
00:42:30.066 --> 00:42:32.635
It's fine, Mom. Let's go.

684
00:42:33.305 --> 00:42:34.376
Wait.

685
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.632

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

686
00:42:58.126 --> 00:43:00.465
I like being in your arms the most.

687
00:43:00.566 --> 00:43:01.666
Goodness.

688
00:43:02.566 --> 00:43:04.905
Why are you so adorable these days?

689
00:43:05.706 --> 00:43:06.976
- Let's go. - All right.

690
00:43:14.146 --> 00:43:15.845
Why aren't you eating?

691
00:43:16.146 --> 00:43:18.845
Eat slowly, and don't get an upset stomach again.

692
00:43:19.046 --> 00:43:20.555
Eat this too.

693
00:43:21.285 --> 00:43:22.686
No, you should eat it.

694
00:43:22.686 --> 00:43:24.256
Eat this.

695
00:43:24.256 --> 00:43:25.756
I'll eat on my own.

696
00:43:25.756 --> 00:43:27.626
Eat up.

697
00:43:27.726 --> 00:43:29.496
I can eat on my own.

698
00:43:30.265 --> 00:43:31.365
Eat.

699
00:43:32.965 --> 00:43:34.095
It's delicious.

700
00:43:36.635 --> 00:43:37.765
Where to?

701
00:43:39.106 --> 00:43:41.006
- Let's go to the park. - Shall we?

702
00:43:41.006 --> 00:43:42.075
- Yes. - All right.

703
00:43:58.526 --> 00:44:01.626
Nam Gil's stepmother must be nice...

704
00:44:01.626 --> 00:44:02.896
to him.

705
00:44:03.325 --> 00:44:04.865
I guess so.

706
00:44:04.865 --> 00:44:07.135
But he's too young to realize that.

707
00:44:08.135 --> 00:44:09.695
Maybe it's because of his real mom.

708
00:44:10.535 --> 00:44:12.436
Isn't he older than you?

709
00:44:12.436 --> 00:44:13.476
Yes.

710
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:16.006
Yes, he is.

711
00:44:16.276 --> 00:44:19.206
He's too focused on his real mother...

712
00:44:19.445 --> 00:44:22.715
that he doesn't see the person who really cares for him.

713
00:44:24.146 --> 00:44:26.785
But he's still young. He must have been hurt...

714
00:44:26.785 --> 00:44:28.715
after his parents got divorced.

715
00:44:29.155 --> 00:44:30.155
What?

716
00:44:34.126 --> 00:44:35.195
Mom.

717
00:44:36.226 --> 00:44:40.296
If I got married, but then got divorced,

718
00:44:40.865 --> 00:44:42.936
what would you say?

719
00:44:43.206 --> 00:44:46.305
I won't let you get married to someone you'd get divorced with.

720
00:44:50.405 --> 00:44:51.476
Do you think...

721
00:44:52.046 --> 00:44:53.876
I always like your father?

722
00:44:54.916 --> 00:44:57.686
He wouldn't always like me.

723
00:44:58.646 --> 00:45:00.155
If I think that way,

724
00:45:00.385 --> 00:45:02.485
I feel like that's how things usually are.

725
00:45:03.526 --> 00:45:05.285
You can't make everything right.

726
00:45:07.226 --> 00:45:08.296
You're right.

727
00:45:09.695 --> 00:45:12.166
The other person would have things they don't like about me too.

728
00:45:13.135 --> 00:45:14.195
You?

729
00:45:15.066 --> 00:45:17.765
You have a weird personality.

730
00:45:19.535 --> 00:45:21.876
Nowadays, you are much better.

731
00:45:29.175 --> 00:45:30.646
If you were there,

732
00:45:31.945 --> 00:45:34.356
would my life have gotten better?

733
00:45:36.215 --> 00:45:38.155
Why are you saying that next to me?

734
00:45:39.796 --> 00:45:41.896
Nothing in life is easy.

735
00:45:42.195 --> 00:45:44.765
You have to go through trials and errors in life.

736
00:45:51.865 --> 00:45:53.006
What are you looking at?

737
00:45:53.006 --> 00:45:54.075
What?

738
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:58.606
Are you looking down on me too?

739
00:45:58.606 --> 00:46:00.046
Are you? Are you?

740
00:46:00.416 --> 00:46:02.476
Are you looking down on me?

741
00:46:02.476 --> 00:46:03.885
Go away.

742
00:46:05.845 --> 00:46:07.816
Don't do that.

743
00:46:07.816 --> 00:46:09.885
I'm a person too!

744
00:46:09.956 --> 00:46:12.186
- Hey! - Gosh.

745
00:46:12.325 --> 00:46:14.026
Let me go.

746
00:46:14.496 --> 00:46:17.666
Just because I'm struggling to live my life,

747
00:46:18.026 --> 00:46:20.566
do I look worthless to you?

748
00:46:20.566 --> 00:46:22.296
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

749
00:46:24.635 --> 00:46:25.765
I'm...

750
00:46:26.436 --> 00:46:27.506
a...

751
00:46:27.706 --> 00:46:29.845
person too!

752
00:46:30.206 --> 00:46:32.445
I'm not a dog!

753
00:46:34.316 --> 00:46:35.376
What...

754
00:46:36.686 --> 00:46:39.316
more can I do!

755
00:46:43.015 --> 00:46:44.785
It's really hard for me.

756
00:46:48.095 --> 00:46:50.796
Don't look down on me.

757
00:46:51.526 --> 00:46:55.265
Gosh, I'm trying!

758
00:46:55.635 --> 00:46:58.436
- Gosh, what am I supposed to do? - He must really be hurt.

759
00:46:58.436 --> 00:46:59.606
Gosh.

760
00:47:00.535 --> 00:47:02.936
I'm trying!

761
00:47:03.376 --> 00:47:06.376
I'm trying!

762
00:47:08.816 --> 00:47:12.345
What more can I do?

763
00:47:13.956 --> 00:47:15.316
What more...

764
00:47:15.316 --> 00:47:16.456
Do you...

765
00:47:17.856 --> 00:47:20.626
know what I have to deal with?

766
00:47:21.425 --> 00:47:22.496
It's like I'm less than a dog.

767
00:47:23.496 --> 00:47:25.496
I'm treated like I'm worthless.

768
00:47:25.726 --> 00:47:27.235
Do you know...

769
00:47:28.865 --> 00:47:30.305
how I live?

770
00:47:31.805 --> 00:47:34.836
Why am I like this?

771
00:47:36.135 --> 00:47:37.376
I...

772
00:47:37.945 --> 00:47:40.376
have always been sincere.

773
00:47:40.876 --> 00:47:42.746
I always tried my best.

774
00:47:43.885 --> 00:47:47.285
I've tried so hard.

775
00:47:47.816 --> 00:47:49.515
Why do I always have to be sorry?

776
00:47:50.526 --> 00:47:51.825
Why am I always apologizing?

777
00:47:54.756 --> 00:47:57.396
Don't look down on me!

778
00:47:58.765 --> 00:48:01.365
I'm trying my best!

779
00:48:02.035 --> 00:48:03.235
I'm...

780
00:48:04.836 --> 00:48:07.735
I'm trying too.

781
00:48:08.575 --> 00:48:09.845
I am.

782
00:48:22.885 --> 00:48:24.055
Why aren't you coming inside?

783
00:48:25.256 --> 00:48:26.256
Mom.

784
00:48:28.026 --> 00:48:30.166
You won't let me get married to someone weird, right?

785
00:48:30.825 --> 00:48:32.526
Even if I beg you,

786
00:48:33.195 --> 00:48:34.535
you'll choose my husband, right?

787
00:48:35.066 --> 00:48:37.206
Of course.

788
00:48:37.206 --> 00:48:39.336
I can't let you get married to someone weird because you begged.

789
00:48:39.606 --> 00:48:42.376
I'm going to choose someone nice for you to get married.

790
00:48:42.706 --> 00:48:44.146
Someone who won't make you cry.

791
00:48:46.006 --> 00:48:48.615
Mom, you should go inside.

792
00:48:48.646 --> 00:48:50.015
I need to go and see someone.

793
00:48:52.345 --> 00:48:53.956
Hey, Jin Joo!

794
00:48:58.485 --> 00:48:59.726
Goodness.

795
00:49:30.325 --> 00:49:32.285
I didn't want to make you cry.

796
00:49:33.396 --> 00:49:34.996
I wanted to make you laugh.

797
00:49:37.166 --> 00:49:38.425
I just wanted you to laugh.

798
00:49:42.195 --> 00:49:45.166
He's too focused on his real mother...

799
00:49:45.265 --> 00:49:48.535
that he doesn't see the person who really cares for him.

800
00:50:12.595 --> 00:50:13.666
Hello?

801
00:50:14.535 --> 00:50:15.735
Where are you?

802
00:50:16.965 --> 00:50:18.066
What?

803
00:50:19.235 --> 00:50:20.675
I'm crying.

804
00:50:22.976 --> 00:50:24.305
Should I cry by myself again?

805
00:50:27.416 --> 00:50:28.515
Don't cry.

806
00:50:29.015 --> 00:50:30.086
I'll be there.

807
00:50:30.945 --> 00:50:32.316
I'll be there. Stay right there.

808
00:50:55.405 --> 00:50:56.405
What is it?

809
00:50:58.146 --> 00:50:59.146
Thank you.

810
00:51:01.445 --> 00:51:02.776
Thank you for saving Jin Joo.

811
00:51:04.186 --> 00:51:05.546
I sincerely thank you.

812
00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:18.925
What's he saying?

813
00:51:23.936 --> 00:51:24.936
What was that?

814
00:51:25.706 --> 00:51:26.976
Why is he grateful?

815
00:52:10.546 --> 00:52:12.186
- He's running out. - No.

816
00:52:12.246 --> 00:52:13.256
Wait.

817
00:52:17.825 --> 00:52:19.325
Jun Su! Jun Su!

818
00:52:19.325 --> 00:52:20.425
Ma Jin Joo!

819
00:53:02.765 --> 00:53:03.765
Oh, no...

820
00:53:05.206 --> 00:53:07.175
Ban Do. No...

821
00:53:10.675 --> 00:53:12.445
Stay with me, Ban Do.

822
00:53:13.316 --> 00:53:14.646
Honey!

823
00:53:18.086 --> 00:53:21.785
No. No...

824
00:53:24.226 --> 00:53:27.496
No. Get up. Get up!

825
00:53:27.655 --> 00:53:28.856
No.

826
00:53:33.235 --> 00:53:35.535
No, no...

827
00:54:02.655 --> 00:54:06.095
Seo Jin, I'm your daddy.

828
00:54:06.396 --> 00:54:08.836
I'll protect you for life.

829
00:54:08.836 --> 00:54:09.836
(Ma Jin Joo)

830
00:54:11.436 --> 00:54:12.436
I mean it.

831
00:54:33.195 --> 00:54:34.456
Honey.

832
00:54:36.256 --> 00:54:37.566
Honey.

833
00:54:39.865 --> 00:54:41.035
Get up.

834
00:54:41.735 --> 00:54:43.735
Get up!

835
00:54:49.606 --> 00:54:51.506
Get up, honey.

836
00:54:53.316 --> 00:54:54.615
Honey.

837
00:54:59.046 --> 00:55:00.655
Back then, if I knew...

838
00:55:01.155 --> 00:55:02.715
everything I know now,

839
00:55:03.856 --> 00:55:04.925
maybe...

840
00:55:05.425 --> 00:55:08.195
we wouldn't have to be here now.

841
00:55:17.535 --> 00:55:19.405
(Epilogue)

842
00:55:24.575 --> 00:55:26.546
You don't have to get out. You should go home.

843
00:55:27.945 --> 00:55:30.046
Okay. Good night.

844
00:55:30.586 --> 00:55:32.845
Bye. Thanks.

845
00:55:56.945 --> 00:55:57.945
Hey, it's you.

846
00:55:59.046 --> 00:56:00.146
What are you doing here?

847
00:56:00.416 --> 00:56:02.075
Why are you home so late?

848
00:56:02.075 --> 00:56:03.945
You left before us.

849
00:56:06.715 --> 00:56:09.155
We didn't make a stop anywhere. That's odd.

850
00:56:09.155 --> 00:56:12.626
And why do you get into a strange man's car like that?

851
00:56:13.425 --> 00:56:16.526
He just got his driving license. What if he gets into an accident?

852
00:56:16.526 --> 00:56:17.626
It's too dangerous.

853
00:56:17.626 --> 00:56:19.325
You're worried over nothing.

854
00:56:19.726 --> 00:56:20.936
Goodness.

855
00:56:24.465 --> 00:56:27.635
So do you feel less frustrated...

856
00:56:27.876 --> 00:56:29.175
after you've seen the ocean?

857
00:56:30.106 --> 00:56:31.106
Yes.

858
00:56:32.876 --> 00:56:34.976
It's been forever since I've been on a trip.

859
00:56:35.916 --> 00:56:38.715
I don't even remember when the last time was.

860
00:56:39.785 --> 00:56:41.555
Maybe that's the case with us.

861
00:56:42.856 --> 00:56:43.856
What is?

862
00:56:44.856 --> 00:56:47.595
We might be here...

863
00:56:48.296 --> 00:56:49.796
for a short trip.

864
00:56:50.595 --> 00:56:51.666
Like a vacation.

865
00:56:53.566 --> 00:56:54.635
That makes sense.

866
00:56:55.535 --> 00:56:57.865
Those up there may have taken pity on us...

867
00:56:58.106 --> 00:57:00.106
and have sent us here on a vacation.

868
00:57:01.836 --> 00:57:03.746
What a spectacle journey.

869
00:57:03.746 --> 00:57:05.206
But you know what?

870
00:57:06.476 --> 00:57:08.316
- What? - A trip...

871
00:57:08.776 --> 00:57:10.546
can only be a trip if you can return.

872
00:57:26.765 --> 00:57:30.265
I mean, if you don't go back, that means you moved there.

873
00:57:30.265 --> 00:57:31.265
Settling down.

874
00:57:58.226 --> 00:58:01.265
(Go Back Couple)

875
00:58:04.135 --> 00:58:05.305
(Court)
