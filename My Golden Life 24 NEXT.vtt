00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:10.166
(Episode 24)

4
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.267
You can go, sir.

5
00:00:47.707 --> 00:00:49.106
What are you doing?

6
00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:50.847
What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:53.816
Were you really trying to run away again?

8
00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:55.816
Because you bothered me.

9
00:01:00.017 --> 00:01:02.616
I told you. Everything bothers me.

10
00:01:05.156 --> 00:01:06.156
Fine.

11
00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:08.356
I knew you'd find me annoying.

12
00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:11.897
Just because I used to be your friend,

13
00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:14.436
I kept interfering with your life since we met...

14
00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:16.537
after 10 years of staying apart.

15
00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:17.736
Even I would find it annoying.

16
00:01:20.777 --> 00:01:21.807
If you know,

17
00:01:22.677 --> 00:01:23.846
just leave.

18
00:01:23.977 --> 00:01:25.206
I can't just leave.

19
00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:28.317
I promised him...

20
00:01:29.076 --> 00:01:30.516
to tell him when you call me.

21
00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:33.087
What?

22
00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:34.557
At first,

23
00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:36.686
I planned to persuade you to go home.

24
00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:39.156
When I found you here,

25
00:01:39.856 --> 00:01:41.296
I thought I shouldn't...

26
00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:45.096
say anything for your pride.

27
00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:47.466
But if you keep doing this,

28
00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.637
I have no choice but to tell him you're here.

29
00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:53.106
What are you...

30
00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:55.837
Who are you talking about?

31
00:01:55.837 --> 00:02:00.346
Hey, you ungrateful girl!

32
00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:02.516
You think you can leave before paying me back?

33
00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:04.346
How dare you try run away at night?

34
00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:08.217
I was going to transfer you the money.

35
00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:09.926
If you had money all along,

36
00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:11.657
why did you stay here?

37
00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:15.627
I see it now. Were you running away together?

38
00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.227
You said that...

39
00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:18.967
if Ms. Seo ran away, you'd pay back my money.

40
00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:20.637
I did.

41
00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:22.366
That's why I gave you my business card.

42
00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:23.467
Please go inside.

43
00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:26.206
I'll send her back in after we talk.

44
00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:28.977
Do you know what that money means to me?

45
00:02:28.977 --> 00:02:30.407
It's 1,000 dollars. With that money,

46
00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:32.106
I can buy my wife's medicine for a month.

47
00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:34.116
You begged me not to report you to the police.

48
00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:35.776
I let you stay with me without knowing neither...

49
00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:37.116
your name nor address.

50
00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:38.586
I deserve more from you!

51
00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:41.116
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:43.387
Please get inside, sir.

53
00:02:44.287 --> 00:02:45.486
Come with me.

54
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:01.836
Ji An's safe.

55
00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:03.447
I'll tell you no more...

56
00:03:03.447 --> 00:03:04.747
because she doesn't want me to.

57
00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:06.977
I hope he took her home safely.

58
00:03:11.146 --> 00:03:12.247
(Did you get home safely?)

59
00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:13.356
(Call me when you see this.)

60
00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:15.856
She didn't even send me a message.

61
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.880
<font face="Papyrus" color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

62
00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:21.657
Forget it.

63
00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:23.967
I'm glad she went back home.

64
00:03:26.097 --> 00:03:27.137
Choi Do Kyung?

65
00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:31.507
Did you say, "Choi Do Kyung"?

66
00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:33.507
Yes, that's the name.

67
00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:36.947
You ran away because of him.

68
00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:39.847
No, I didn't run away because of him.

69
00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:41.576
Whatever you tell me,

70
00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:44.847
I cannot let you run away like this.

71
00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:47.387
But since you find me annoying,

72
00:03:47.387 --> 00:03:49.116
- I can tell him... - No.

73
00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:51.187
Never.

74
00:03:52.157 --> 00:03:53.997
Then at least give me your parents' number.

75
00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:55.896
I went to your house before,

76
00:03:55.896 --> 00:03:57.997
but a new tenant said you moved.

77
00:03:58.967 --> 00:03:59.997
I moved?

78
00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:02.396
Who told you that?

79
00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:04.366
A lady who moved into your house.

80
00:04:09.907 --> 00:04:11.776
Why are you the only one running away?

81
00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:13.347
- What about him? - No.

82
00:04:14.447 --> 00:04:16.177
We are not like that.

83
00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:22.117
He just used to be my brother.

84
00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:24.387
What?

85
00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:26.797
What do you mean?

86
00:04:30.497 --> 00:04:32.766
The moment I saw the vice president punching Dad...

87
00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:34.737
and Dad kneeling in front of him,

88
00:04:35.396 --> 00:04:36.497
I knew.

89
00:04:38.137 --> 00:04:39.437
"I'm done for."

90
00:04:40.476 --> 00:04:42.036
"I won't survive this."

91
00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:45.406
Ji An.

92
00:04:46.346 --> 00:04:48.146
I wanted to kill myself.

93
00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:52.887
My parents raised me with love for 28 years,

94
00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:56.216
but I gave them up...

95
00:04:56.216 --> 00:04:57.857
in a matter of days to choose rich parents.

96
00:04:59.487 --> 00:05:01.026
I wanted to kill myself for that.

97
00:05:02.697 --> 00:05:04.197
However, I failed.

98
00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:08.237
You thought they were your real parents.

99
00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:09.336
But they are not.

100
00:05:13.206 --> 00:05:14.206
They're not.

101
00:05:16.406 --> 00:05:18.007
But what if...

102
00:05:18.747 --> 00:05:21.016
it turns out you're a son of a rich family?

103
00:05:21.346 --> 00:05:22.646
What would you do then?

104
00:05:22.646 --> 00:05:23.817
I won't go.

105
00:05:23.817 --> 00:05:25.687
If your real parents aren't rich...

106
00:05:25.687 --> 00:05:28.557
and much poorer than your current parents,

107
00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:29.887
would you still go?

108
00:05:31.257 --> 00:05:32.387
I won't.

109
00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:34.726
In the end, you're going because of their wealth.

110
00:05:34.797 --> 00:05:36.867
Can there be real connections...

111
00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:38.596
between them based on money?

112
00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.997
So that's why you asked that.

113
00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.507
It was about me.

114
00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:48.107
The fool who went for their wealth.

115
00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:51.307
That's me.

116
00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:56.047
Ji An.

117
00:05:56.586 --> 00:05:58.646
So please just leave me alone.

118
00:05:59.846 --> 00:06:00.956
Take care.

119
00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:53.836
Yang Mi Jung came to say she's going to confess?

120
00:06:54.406 --> 00:06:56.007
I told her not to.

121
00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:58.476
I said we'll forgive her for Ji Soo's sake.

122
00:06:59.447 --> 00:07:01.776
I also told her to keep running the restaurant.

123
00:07:04.216 --> 00:07:05.916
I did what you wanted.

124
00:07:06.547 --> 00:07:07.656
Are you happy?

125
00:07:08.716 --> 00:07:11.127
That was the best we could do for our family.

126
00:07:11.557 --> 00:07:13.757
What about Ji Soo... No.

127
00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:16.396
What should I do with Eun Seok's part-time job?

128
00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:18.127
Let her work for the time being.

129
00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:19.567
Okay.

130
00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:24.007
Ji Soo and I...

131
00:07:25.036 --> 00:07:26.807
aren't ready to accept each other yet,

132
00:07:26.807 --> 00:07:28.276
so let's take our time.

133
00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:35.976
Ji An!

134
00:07:40.016 --> 00:07:41.187
Tae Soo.

135
00:07:42.887 --> 00:07:44.456
Did you dream about Ji An?

136
00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:47.456
Yes.

137
00:07:52.197 --> 00:07:53.867
You're not going out at this hour, are you?

138
00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:55.997
You didn't get any sleep.

139
00:08:18.226 --> 00:08:19.997
That guy left.

140
00:08:20.956 --> 00:08:22.627
Don't you try to run away again.

141
00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:24.266
I won't.

142
00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:30.536
By the way, can Hyuk share that room with you?

143
00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:32.607
What? With me?

144
00:08:32.607 --> 00:08:34.607
Well, you...

145
00:08:34.607 --> 00:08:37.007
stay both at your parents' and your house.

146
00:08:37.007 --> 00:08:38.676
You sometimes drink with your neighbors...

147
00:08:38.676 --> 00:08:40.377
and sleep in that room too.

148
00:08:40.377 --> 00:08:41.816
We aren't picky either.

149
00:08:42.516 --> 00:08:44.316
Will you be okay with that?

150
00:08:45.046 --> 00:08:46.656
Your sister gave me a list of reasons...

151
00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:48.516
why I should be okay with the arrangement.

152
00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:50.286
Thank you.

153
00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:52.526
And I can't work for a few days.

154
00:08:52.526 --> 00:08:53.556
Please take care of our business.

155
00:08:53.556 --> 00:08:54.556
Okay.

156
00:08:54.556 --> 00:08:56.097
If only I hired a part-timer sooner,

157
00:08:56.097 --> 00:08:57.896
I could've cleaned the room for him.

158
00:08:57.896 --> 00:08:58.997
I'm holding interviews today.

159
00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.337
Really?

160
00:09:00.967 --> 00:09:03.737
I should hold interviews with you.

161
00:09:03.737 --> 00:09:05.036
Don't even think about it.

162
00:09:05.036 --> 00:09:06.776
Why would you have a say in it? It's my part-timer.

163
00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:09.436
Hee, you've gotten your energy back.

164
00:09:10.077 --> 00:09:12.077
I've never seen you scold Hyuk.

165
00:09:12.406 --> 00:09:13.416
That's true.

166
00:09:13.416 --> 00:09:15.416
Hee, you changed recently.

167
00:09:16.046 --> 00:09:17.087
Did something happen?

168
00:09:17.087 --> 00:09:18.516
Nothing happened.

169
00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:20.587
I can't continue to work with your help.

170
00:09:20.587 --> 00:09:22.686
I need to start taking charge now.

171
00:09:23.016 --> 00:09:24.926
Get going.

172
00:09:24.926 --> 00:09:26.087
Okay.

173
00:09:26.186 --> 00:09:28.827
Yong Gook and Hee. Take care of yourselves.

174
00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:35.166
You didn't get bread?

175
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:39.737
I'm thinking of switching to another bakery.

176
00:09:40.176 --> 00:09:42.377
Nonsense. Many customers love that bread.

177
00:09:42.577 --> 00:09:44.247
Or you can simply order other breads from there.

178
00:09:44.347 --> 00:09:46.717
Okay. I'll get more bread.

179
00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:48.046
You should get going.

180
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.646
All right. I'm off now.

181
00:09:50.217 --> 00:09:51.487
- Bye. - Bye.

182
00:10:11.237 --> 00:10:12.637
You're here.

183
00:10:12.806 --> 00:10:13.877
What happened?

184
00:10:13.877 --> 00:10:15.107
Did you just get here?

185
00:10:15.237 --> 00:10:16.776
I'm really sorry about the other day.

186
00:10:16.776 --> 00:10:18.107
Something happened with my friend.

187
00:10:18.107 --> 00:10:19.347
I was so distracted.

188
00:10:20.416 --> 00:10:22.217
I didn't even ask if you got here safely.

189
00:10:22.276 --> 00:10:23.387
That's all right.

190
00:10:23.387 --> 00:10:25.816
I understand if you had to go.

191
00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:28.156
I didn't know you met your friend.

192
00:10:29.617 --> 00:10:31.056
I will treat you...

193
00:10:31.556 --> 00:10:33.227
to a meal to make up for it.

194
00:10:34.026 --> 00:10:35.426
A meal?

195
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.127
A delicious meal.

196
00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:46.306
I guess you were making the salt from scratch...

197
00:10:46.306 --> 00:10:47.477
from the salt field.

198
00:10:48.477 --> 00:10:49.477
I'm sorry.

199
00:10:49.477 --> 00:10:51.377
You're sorry? Is that it?

200
00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:53.176
If you were sorry, you should've called.

201
00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:54.847
You made this weak girl...

202
00:10:54.847 --> 00:10:56.617
carry a bag of salt by herself.

203
00:10:56.617 --> 00:10:59.046
- Sorry? - Well, about that.

204
00:10:59.046 --> 00:11:00.717
We needed salt right away on that day.

205
00:11:00.717 --> 00:11:03.286
I went to the truck and brought a bag with me.

206
00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:04.286
You did?

207
00:11:05.426 --> 00:11:07.457
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

208
00:11:08.857 --> 00:11:10.827
Mr. Kang, I'm sorry.

209
00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:13.997
Exactly. How are you going to make up for it?

210
00:11:14.467 --> 00:11:16.367
I told Ji Soo I'm going to treat her to a meal.

211
00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:18.007
For you...

212
00:11:19.707 --> 00:11:20.776
Oh, right.

213
00:11:21.137 --> 00:11:23.207
The owner of the cafe must've upset you.

214
00:11:23.207 --> 00:11:24.847
I found out she stopped ordering from you.

215
00:11:24.847 --> 00:11:27.477
Maybe she doesn't like my bread.

216
00:11:28.016 --> 00:11:29.176
No.

217
00:11:29.577 --> 00:11:31.946
It's just that she doesn't have good social skills.

218
00:11:32.416 --> 00:11:33.587
Send her the bread again.

219
00:11:34.487 --> 00:11:35.587
Really?

220
00:11:36.156 --> 00:11:37.587
Are you sure? Okay.

221
00:11:37.587 --> 00:11:40.196
I'll bake some right now and bring them to her.

222
00:11:40.196 --> 00:11:41.796
Isn't today your day off?

223
00:11:42.497 --> 00:11:44.727
And you're here too, Ji Soo.

224
00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:46.026
It is our day off,

225
00:11:46.026 --> 00:11:48.337
but I was going to teach her how to bake.

226
00:11:48.337 --> 00:11:49.597
Thank you. Thank you.

227
00:11:49.597 --> 00:11:50.936
I should be thanking you.

228
00:11:51.337 --> 00:11:52.566
I'm slammed today, so...

229
00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:54.276
You are? Leave them.

230
00:11:54.276 --> 00:11:55.477
I'll carry them inside.

231
00:11:56.207 --> 00:11:57.247
My goodness.

232
00:12:00.446 --> 00:12:01.747
- Thank you. - Go on.

233
00:12:01.747 --> 00:12:03.176
- I'll go now. - Okay.

234
00:12:06.087 --> 00:12:07.117
Bye.

235
00:12:07.117 --> 00:12:09.117
Bye.

236
00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:12.286
She wants the bread again.

237
00:12:12.327 --> 00:12:13.556
He asked me to have a meal with him.

238
00:12:14.327 --> 00:12:15.857
What should we eat?

239
00:12:27.036 --> 00:12:28.477
Excuse me for 10 minutes.

240
00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:39.957
Why can't you be more considerate?

241
00:12:40.457 --> 00:12:41.816
Why did you come without giving me a call?

242
00:12:43.156 --> 00:12:45.426
I am sorry.

243
00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:48.997
I left home early and had some free time.

244
00:12:49.696 --> 00:12:50.997
You left home early?

245
00:12:53.737 --> 00:12:55.396
Have you been well?

246
00:12:56.936 --> 00:13:00.406
I guess they treat you well?

247
00:13:00.577 --> 00:13:02.176
Of course they treat me well.

248
00:13:02.707 --> 00:13:03.946
I'm their real daughter.

249
00:13:05.676 --> 00:13:07.446
Right. Right.

250
00:13:08.077 --> 00:13:10.016
I'm sure they treat you well.

251
00:13:10.646 --> 00:13:12.487
I'm sure they do.

252
00:13:15.617 --> 00:13:17.487
Why did you leave home early?

253
00:13:18.327 --> 00:13:20.196
- To meet me? - I'm looking for Ji An.

254
00:13:22.526 --> 00:13:25.396
You're looking for Ji An.

255
00:13:27.036 --> 00:13:29.396
So I wanted to ask you.

256
00:13:29.906 --> 00:13:32.436
When you met Ji An,

257
00:13:32.766 --> 00:13:34.776
what did you two talk about?

258
00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:37.146
Did you come here to ask me that?

259
00:13:38.146 --> 00:13:39.607
Ji An...

260
00:13:40.117 --> 00:13:43.516
still hasn't called. It's been over a week.

261
00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:47.686
So tell me...

262
00:13:48.357 --> 00:13:49.887
what you talked about with her.

263
00:13:50.727 --> 00:13:51.957
I don't want to tell you.

264
00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.696
- What? - I don't want to say it.

265
00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:59.266
Why do you want to know what we talked about?

266
00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:01.997
Why do I have to tell you what we talked about?

267
00:14:01.997 --> 00:14:03.467
Just tell me.

268
00:14:09.477 --> 00:14:13.617
Don't you know why Ji An went to you?

269
00:14:13.617 --> 00:14:14.916
Don't you really know?

270
00:14:15.347 --> 00:14:17.516
You are the only one she met.

271
00:14:17.946 --> 00:14:20.117
So I need to know what you talked about...

272
00:14:20.487 --> 00:14:24.127
to understand how she must've felt.

273
00:14:24.357 --> 00:14:25.587
I hit her.

274
00:14:28.357 --> 00:14:29.426
What?

275
00:14:29.497 --> 00:14:32.327
I got mad at her for not telling me, so I hit her.

276
00:14:33.066 --> 00:14:35.296
She's just like you and Mom.

277
00:14:35.896 --> 00:14:37.507
Hey.

278
00:14:38.107 --> 00:14:41.237
How can you do that?

279
00:14:41.906 --> 00:14:44.306
You knew it wasn't her fault.

280
00:14:45.347 --> 00:14:48.776
How can you treat her like that when she went to you?

281
00:14:49.446 --> 00:14:51.946
How would she endure it?

282
00:14:52.487 --> 00:14:54.516
Don't you know her?

283
00:14:55.487 --> 00:14:57.526
Have you seen her giving up anything?

284
00:14:58.227 --> 00:15:01.827
After you bankrupted, she only gave up art school.

285
00:15:01.896 --> 00:15:04.327
She studied like crazy as soon as she gave it up.

286
00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:06.327
How can you...

287
00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:10.666
not know anything about your sister?

288
00:15:11.166 --> 00:15:13.137
When she was preparing to get a job...

289
00:15:13.607 --> 00:15:15.607
and even when she didn't get the job,

290
00:15:16.306 --> 00:15:19.406
she didn't give up because of her ego.

291
00:15:20.046 --> 00:15:23.516
That's why she will never come home now.

292
00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:26.217
She doesn't want to see you and Mom.

293
00:15:27.016 --> 00:15:30.257
She revealed the truth even without telling me.

294
00:15:31.827 --> 00:15:34.696
It would've been easier if she blamed you two.

295
00:15:36.497 --> 00:15:37.666
That's her.

296
00:15:38.066 --> 00:15:40.367
That's how tough she is.

297
00:15:41.666 --> 00:15:43.536
I'm sure she will come after a month.

298
00:15:44.867 --> 00:15:46.266
No.

299
00:15:46.906 --> 00:15:48.207
No.

300
00:15:50.607 --> 00:15:52.676
You could've understood her.

301
00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:54.347
You could've.

302
00:15:55.077 --> 00:15:56.617
How could I?

303
00:15:57.816 --> 00:16:00.617
She met me many times even after finding out.

304
00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:03.056
Every time, she pretended nothing was wrong.

305
00:16:03.526 --> 00:16:06.526
I wouldn't have been able to do that if I were her.

306
00:16:07.627 --> 00:16:08.957
That's why...

307
00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:11.696
I can never forgive her.

308
00:16:42.257 --> 00:16:44.766
(DNA test result)

309
00:16:44.766 --> 00:16:48.036
99.9 percent probability.

310
00:16:49.796 --> 00:16:51.936
Seo Ji Soo is my daughter.

311
00:16:52.566 --> 00:16:53.707
Yes.

312
00:16:57.107 --> 00:16:59.347
I will go now.

313
00:17:00.877 --> 00:17:03.717
Get another instructor.

314
00:17:03.986 --> 00:17:05.216
Get a house...

315
00:17:07.087 --> 00:17:09.186
to teach Eun Seok too.

316
00:17:09.517 --> 00:17:10.627
Yes, Ma'am.

317
00:17:18.797 --> 00:17:20.736
(Father)

318
00:17:24.537 --> 00:17:25.906
Myung Hee.

319
00:17:27.307 --> 00:17:29.736
Why are you answering the phone?

320
00:17:30.047 --> 00:17:32.077
Your father just got admitted in the clinic...

321
00:17:32.077 --> 00:17:33.476
for swollen tonsils.

322
00:17:33.976 --> 00:17:36.246
- He's getting tested now. - Again?

323
00:17:36.817 --> 00:17:38.216
Is it really serious?

324
00:17:38.547 --> 00:17:40.216
He can't talk.

325
00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:42.716
I'll deliver the message for you.

326
00:17:43.986 --> 00:17:46.057
I was going to say I'm coming to Hawaii...

327
00:17:46.057 --> 00:17:47.327
to visit him.

328
00:17:47.827 --> 00:17:51.027
You should cancel. Come when he's well.

329
00:17:52.496 --> 00:17:54.466
Okay. I will do that.

330
00:17:55.137 --> 00:17:57.267
Tell me when you get the results.

331
00:17:59.267 --> 00:18:00.476
Okay.

332
00:18:08.517 --> 00:18:09.676
What do I do?

333
00:18:23.426 --> 00:18:25.127
Cancel the lunch appointment.

334
00:18:25.426 --> 00:18:26.867
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:18:32.137 --> 00:18:33.537
You were in such a hurry that I thought...

336
00:18:33.537 --> 00:18:34.936
you'd come right away.

337
00:18:34.936 --> 00:18:36.307
You're late.

338
00:18:36.877 --> 00:18:38.077
I've been busy.

339
00:18:46.887 --> 00:18:48.916
It should arrive before December.

340
00:18:49.486 --> 00:18:51.156
I'm going to wear matching jewelries...

341
00:18:51.156 --> 00:18:53.226
with my daughter on the foundation anniversary.

342
00:18:53.226 --> 00:18:56.156
The designers said it was going to be tough...

343
00:18:56.156 --> 00:18:59.297
getting these made on time, but I begged them.

344
00:19:00.696 --> 00:19:02.936
Well done. I won't forget it.

345
00:19:03.196 --> 00:19:04.736
I'm jealous that you and your daughter...

346
00:19:04.736 --> 00:19:06.267
will be wearing matching jewelries.

347
00:20:16.377 --> 00:20:19.976
What are you doing? Do you think I'm joking?

348
00:20:19.976 --> 00:20:21.117
What?

349
00:20:21.176 --> 00:20:22.976
I've just come to deliver the bread.

350
00:20:23.317 --> 00:20:25.047
Mr. Sunwoo placed the order.

351
00:20:28.756 --> 00:20:32.456
Which coffee should I drink today?

352
00:20:32.756 --> 00:20:37.027
You know that he is my brother, right?

353
00:20:37.327 --> 00:20:38.466
I know.

354
00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:40.736
He used to be really cute.

355
00:20:41.137 --> 00:20:43.906
If you tell him, I will close this down.

356
00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:48.006
I'll get cappuccino.

357
00:20:55.176 --> 00:20:57.287
You have a lot of working experiences.

358
00:20:57.347 --> 00:21:00.617
Yes. I am never late, and I greet customers well.

359
00:21:00.617 --> 00:21:02.656
I clean well and wash the dishes well too.

360
00:21:02.656 --> 00:21:05.827
I recycle well, and I open and close the shop well.

361
00:21:07.327 --> 00:21:08.926
She talks too much.

362
00:21:09.127 --> 00:21:11.696
No. No.

363
00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:14.297
I can't figure it out.

364
00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:17.867
Excuse me, ma'am?

365
00:21:20.206 --> 00:21:23.006
Can you work full-time?

366
00:21:23.006 --> 00:21:24.547
I said no.

367
00:21:25.406 --> 00:21:29.377
If you can work full-time, until when can you do it?

368
00:21:29.377 --> 00:21:32.146
Until I join the army. I am thinking six months.

369
00:21:36.387 --> 00:21:39.186
Okay. I will think about it and call you.

370
00:21:39.827 --> 00:21:41.426
- Thank you. - Thank you.

371
00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:03.847
All right.

372
00:22:04.646 --> 00:22:05.817
Let me join.

373
00:22:05.817 --> 00:22:07.517
Why are you back again?

374
00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:09.087
I went to get my things.

375
00:22:09.087 --> 00:22:11.087
I'm going to stay here until you decide to go.

376
00:22:15.196 --> 00:22:17.067
Why are you doing this?

377
00:22:19.067 --> 00:22:20.797
You heard everything.

378
00:22:21.837 --> 00:22:23.637
So don't bother me. Just go.

379
00:22:23.637 --> 00:22:24.966
I'm here to work.

380
00:22:25.537 --> 00:22:27.736
Mr. Gong said he needed more hands.

381
00:22:27.906 --> 00:22:29.577
Don't talk nonsense.

382
00:22:30.146 --> 00:22:31.906
What do you know about this work?

383
00:22:31.906 --> 00:22:33.746
This work is really tough.

384
00:22:34.246 --> 00:22:36.017
Did you know when you first began?

385
00:22:39.246 --> 00:22:40.456
Hyuk.

386
00:22:41.087 --> 00:22:42.357
When I was doing a part-time job...

387
00:22:42.357 --> 00:22:43.887
after the college entrance exam,

388
00:22:43.887 --> 00:22:45.557
all the fish in the fish farm died,

389
00:22:45.557 --> 00:22:47.956
and I had to scoop out dead fish for 4 days.

390
00:22:49.027 --> 00:22:51.297
This is going to bring back memories.

391
00:22:53.396 --> 00:22:55.537
Even if you do this, I won't change my mind.

392
00:22:56.767 --> 00:22:58.166
Let's just work.

393
00:22:58.906 --> 00:23:01.406
Having watched it for one day actually helps.

394
00:23:04.246 --> 00:23:05.377
Do what you like.

395
00:23:05.877 --> 00:23:08.277
I told you. I don't care about anyone.

396
00:23:19.686 --> 00:23:22.127
To bring in other customers as well,

397
00:23:22.256 --> 00:23:23.367
you should come up with a marketing strategy...

398
00:23:23.367 --> 00:23:25.896
that tells a story.

399
00:23:25.896 --> 00:23:27.166
Okay, sir.

400
00:23:27.496 --> 00:23:28.936
Let's end there.

401
00:23:28.936 --> 00:23:30.267
Wait, sir.

402
00:23:30.807 --> 00:23:32.567
The design team sent the result of...

403
00:23:32.567 --> 00:23:34.337
the storytelling patch design contest.

404
00:23:34.936 --> 00:23:37.807
Ji An must've joined the contest too.

405
00:23:39.607 --> 00:23:40.817
(Winner, Seo Ji An)

406
00:23:40.817 --> 00:23:43.017
(Duck Logo)

407
00:23:43.916 --> 00:23:44.946
Winner?

408
00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:48.057
Yes. But she's out of reach.

409
00:23:48.486 --> 00:23:50.327
There's a prize too.

410
00:23:50.627 --> 00:23:52.027
I don't know what to do.

411
00:24:04.666 --> 00:24:05.837
Did you call me?

412
00:24:05.867 --> 00:24:08.006
Check if Ji An went home yesterday.

413
00:24:08.107 --> 00:24:09.307
Okay, sir.

414
00:24:09.607 --> 00:24:11.377
Do it here.

415
00:24:12.206 --> 00:24:13.317
Okay.

416
00:24:16.847 --> 00:24:18.146
Are you sure?

417
00:24:20.317 --> 00:24:22.857
What did he say? What is he saying?

418
00:24:23.287 --> 00:24:24.327
Okay.

419
00:24:27.956 --> 00:24:29.896
She didn't come home.

420
00:24:29.896 --> 00:24:31.297
What do you mean she didn't come home?

421
00:24:31.527 --> 00:24:33.966
Are they guarding the house properly?

422
00:24:34.137 --> 00:24:35.666
Perhaps they are slacking off somewhere?

423
00:24:35.837 --> 00:24:37.206
How can she not come home?

424
00:24:37.206 --> 00:24:39.307
Why wouldn't she come home when she's with that guy?

425
00:24:39.307 --> 00:24:41.476
If she came home...

426
00:24:41.476 --> 00:24:42.736
and they failed to spot her,

427
00:24:42.736 --> 00:24:45.077
I won't be paying them.

428
00:24:46.107 --> 00:24:47.117
What?

429
00:24:47.976 --> 00:24:49.547
Then what happened?

430
00:24:57.656 --> 00:24:59.527
Yes, this is Mamdaero.

431
00:25:00.127 --> 00:25:01.726
Please put on Mr. Sunwoo Hyuk.

432
00:25:01.726 --> 00:25:03.726
He's on a business trip.

433
00:25:03.726 --> 00:25:05.027
Business trip?

434
00:25:05.527 --> 00:25:06.736
To where?

435
00:25:06.767 --> 00:25:08.496
I'm sorry, but who am I speaking to?

436
00:25:08.867 --> 00:25:10.767
Never mind. I will call back.

437
00:25:11.607 --> 00:25:14.637
When is he coming back from the trip?

438
00:25:14.736 --> 00:25:17.277
I don't know. I think it's going to take a few days.

439
00:25:17.706 --> 00:25:19.706
The exact date isn't set yet.

440
00:25:19.706 --> 00:25:20.877
If you give me your name, I will...

441
00:25:20.877 --> 00:25:22.047
Okay.

442
00:25:26.686 --> 00:25:28.087
That's strange.

443
00:25:28.686 --> 00:25:30.127
He's on a business trip?

444
00:25:31.726 --> 00:25:34.156
And he doesn't know the returning date.

445
00:25:37.496 --> 00:25:39.226
I don't know what to say.

446
00:25:39.226 --> 00:25:41.637
You think it's strange too, don't you?

447
00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:44.337
Perhaps she's ill?

448
00:25:44.506 --> 00:25:45.637
Maybe she's hurt?

449
00:25:47.176 --> 00:25:49.037
Maybe that's why she can't move at all.

450
00:25:49.037 --> 00:25:50.476
If she's either sick or hurt,

451
00:25:50.476 --> 00:25:52.146
he would've taken her to a hospital.

452
00:25:52.146 --> 00:25:53.317
Then why would he go there...

453
00:25:53.317 --> 00:25:54.476
instead of bringing her home?

454
00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:57.246
Anyway, it's certain that her friend is with her.

455
00:25:57.587 --> 00:25:58.746
Aren't you relieved?

456
00:25:58.746 --> 00:26:00.317
I am. I am very relieved.

457
00:26:10.027 --> 00:26:11.496
Goodness.

458
00:26:11.496 --> 00:26:14.267
How can you work so well?

459
00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:17.906
I am good at anything that's fun to do.

460
00:26:18.936 --> 00:26:20.236
Is this fun?

461
00:26:20.236 --> 00:26:21.476
It's really fun.

462
00:26:21.807 --> 00:26:24.807
I just need to evenly flatten it.

463
00:26:25.377 --> 00:26:27.416
- Time flies when I do it. - My goodness.

464
00:26:27.416 --> 00:26:29.716
He might end up staying here for good.

465
00:26:29.716 --> 00:26:31.587
You should just stay here for good.

466
00:26:31.587 --> 00:26:33.517
- Yes. - Stay here for good.

467
00:26:33.517 --> 00:26:34.756
Should I?

468
00:26:35.857 --> 00:26:36.926
Should I just live here?

469
00:26:36.926 --> 00:26:38.587
I will treat you to makgeolli today.

470
00:26:38.587 --> 00:26:40.456
Yes!

471
00:26:41.226 --> 00:26:43.327
Please.

472
00:26:43.327 --> 00:26:44.666
Stop.

473
00:27:08.617 --> 00:27:11.387
(Mother)

474
00:27:18.627 --> 00:27:21.337
(Do Kyung)

475
00:27:25.767 --> 00:27:27.037
Hello?

476
00:27:27.337 --> 00:27:28.406
It's me.

477
00:27:29.377 --> 00:27:30.547
I know.

478
00:27:30.547 --> 00:27:31.906
You're off today, aren't you?

479
00:27:31.906 --> 00:27:33.077
You weren't at home.

480
00:27:33.746 --> 00:27:35.277
What's up?

481
00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:37.847
I think Mom's gotten over the shock.

482
00:27:38.246 --> 00:27:40.416
She wants to hold a welcoming party for you.

483
00:27:40.857 --> 00:27:42.817
I don't need that.

484
00:27:44.256 --> 00:27:45.756
You don't need it.

485
00:27:46.357 --> 00:27:48.097
But why don't you cut her some slack?

486
00:28:00.206 --> 00:28:01.307
Get in, miss.

487
00:28:02.837 --> 00:28:05.077
I hope you will do whatever Ms. Min asks.

488
00:28:05.877 --> 00:28:07.017
Please.

489
00:28:16.787 --> 00:28:19.057
Please lie down here.

490
00:28:19.387 --> 00:28:20.426
Okay.

491
00:28:33.206 --> 00:28:34.736
That's it.

492
00:28:35.906 --> 00:28:36.906
My goodness.

493
00:28:38.646 --> 00:28:40.017
It feels really good.

494
00:29:30.867 --> 00:29:31.896
Is that it?

495
00:29:33.297 --> 00:29:34.297
What?

496
00:29:34.297 --> 00:29:35.936
That thing inside your case.

497
00:29:35.936 --> 00:29:37.307
Is that 700,000 dollars?

498
00:29:37.637 --> 00:29:40.506
Do you want to check if it's 700,000 dollars?

499
00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:43.646
Never mind.

500
00:29:43.646 --> 00:29:46.146
- Give me the case first. - If I give you this,

501
00:29:46.847 --> 00:29:48.446
will you delete the photos...

502
00:29:48.446 --> 00:29:50.087
and cancel the divorce?

503
00:29:50.587 --> 00:29:52.117
What can I do?

504
00:29:52.887 --> 00:29:55.156
I can't forgive you,

505
00:29:55.156 --> 00:29:56.186
but I will forgive you...

506
00:29:56.186 --> 00:29:57.557
for the sake of the child.

507
00:29:59.486 --> 00:30:00.726
Not yet.

508
00:30:02.456 --> 00:30:04.767
Are you really going to...

509
00:30:04.996 --> 00:30:06.127
act like it never happened?

510
00:30:06.637 --> 00:30:09.436
I can't let my child grow up without a dad.

511
00:30:09.436 --> 00:30:11.706
So I will be generous and forgive you.

512
00:30:11.706 --> 00:30:14.637
That's it. Good job, my darling.

513
00:30:16.107 --> 00:30:18.976
Thank you. Thank you so much.

514
00:30:18.976 --> 00:30:20.916
You should be thankful.

515
00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:23.787
Did you think I was going to say that?

516
00:30:25.617 --> 00:30:26.617
(Wife)

517
00:30:26.617 --> 00:30:27.617
What?

518
00:30:36.027 --> 00:30:37.696
What are you doing?

519
00:30:37.696 --> 00:30:40.067
Are you okay with the photos being leaked?

520
00:30:42.436 --> 00:30:43.767
Do it if you can dare.

521
00:30:44.607 --> 00:30:45.736
What?

522
00:30:46.107 --> 00:30:48.537
Do it if you want to go to jail for fraud.

523
00:30:51.446 --> 00:30:52.506
Honey.

524
00:31:02.456 --> 00:31:04.857
Those who commit fraud shall pay...

525
00:31:04.986 --> 00:31:07.726
the equivalent amount of money...

526
00:31:07.726 --> 00:31:10.597
or benefits you gained...

527
00:31:10.597 --> 00:31:12.926
through the criminal act...

528
00:31:12.926 --> 00:31:14.367
or from a third party.

529
00:31:14.736 --> 00:31:15.736
You know that, right?

530
00:31:15.966 --> 00:31:17.367
When the amount you gained is...

531
00:31:17.367 --> 00:31:19.236
more than 500,000 dollars,

532
00:31:19.236 --> 00:31:20.877
there are additional punishments.

533
00:31:21.976 --> 00:31:23.646
You'll receive more than three years of jail time.

534
00:31:24.077 --> 00:31:26.976
This law passed...

535
00:31:29.047 --> 00:31:31.246
in 2016.

536
00:31:34.517 --> 00:31:36.387
Stop talking nonsense.

537
00:31:38.027 --> 00:31:39.387
You are the ones...

538
00:31:40.827 --> 00:31:41.956
who are talking nonsense.

539
00:31:43.926 --> 00:31:45.797
I have proof that...

540
00:31:45.797 --> 00:31:46.936
she had an affair with my husband.

541
00:31:47.396 --> 00:31:49.496
You two are...

542
00:31:49.496 --> 00:31:51.607
such a sweet couple.

543
00:31:52.506 --> 00:31:53.577
All right.

544
00:31:55.206 --> 00:31:56.676
Let's listen to this first.

545
00:31:57.547 --> 00:31:58.877
Honey.

546
00:31:58.877 --> 00:32:01.716
Change of plans. No drive-in theaters.

547
00:32:01.976 --> 00:32:03.946
She's suddenly into clubs,

548
00:32:03.946 --> 00:32:05.916
so we're heading to a club in Hongdae now.

549
00:32:06.756 --> 00:32:09.216
You should go to the club we first met...

550
00:32:09.216 --> 00:32:11.656
and secure a spot in the VIP parking lot.

551
00:32:12.357 --> 00:32:13.357
Hurry.

552
00:32:13.597 --> 00:32:14.996
Surprise.

553
00:32:14.996 --> 00:32:16.567
All right. Next.

554
00:32:26.906 --> 00:32:28.337
How did you get this?

555
00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:29.906
Well...

556
00:32:30.246 --> 00:32:33.047
Your car was parked in the VIP parking lot that day.

557
00:32:33.646 --> 00:32:35.047
But it was your first time to go to the club.

558
00:32:35.476 --> 00:32:38.587
The parking lot for VIPs on your first day?

559
00:32:39.287 --> 00:32:40.686
That doesn't make sense.

560
00:32:41.117 --> 00:32:42.456
And I saw her...

561
00:32:44.256 --> 00:32:45.656
that day.

562
00:32:47.496 --> 00:32:49.896
Everything was so strange.

563
00:32:54.137 --> 00:32:56.297
I checked the surveillance camera...

564
00:32:56.906 --> 00:32:59.436
and found her rehearsing the scene.

565
00:33:01.607 --> 00:33:02.676
You're here.

566
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:03.847
- Hey. - Yes.

567
00:33:03.847 --> 00:33:05.906
- Is this place for VIPs? - Yes.

568
00:33:06.746 --> 00:33:09.476
I think I saw a new car here a few days ago.

569
00:33:09.877 --> 00:33:14.557
Well... Some woman bribed me with some money, so...

570
00:33:15.817 --> 00:33:16.827
Just move on.

571
00:33:17.527 --> 00:33:18.827
Is this the woman?

572
00:33:20.027 --> 00:33:21.226
Yes.

573
00:33:21.756 --> 00:33:23.156
Okay.

574
00:33:24.627 --> 00:33:26.297
Excuse me.

575
00:33:27.097 --> 00:33:28.267
All right.

576
00:33:28.767 --> 00:33:30.236
Okay.

577
00:33:31.206 --> 00:33:33.706
She changed her plan...

578
00:33:33.706 --> 00:33:36.037
and went to a club instead of a drive-in theater,

579
00:33:36.777 --> 00:33:40.916
but how did his wife know that and chased them?

580
00:33:41.946 --> 00:33:43.047
The answer is...

581
00:33:43.347 --> 00:33:46.246
the audio record from the black box in the car.

582
00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:51.156
That's why you told me not to let him drive...

583
00:33:51.387 --> 00:33:53.057
and took the car key from me.

584
00:33:53.456 --> 00:33:54.557
Bingo.

585
00:33:55.196 --> 00:33:56.256
Plus,

586
00:33:56.867 --> 00:33:58.027
there's one more.

587
00:34:00.496 --> 00:34:01.637
Bonus.

588
00:34:09.736 --> 00:34:13.747
The game is over, you frauds.

589
00:34:14.017 --> 00:34:17.017
How dare you toy with the daughter of Haesung?

590
00:34:20.287 --> 00:34:23.656
So what? It can't even be evidence of fraud.

591
00:34:30.796 --> 00:34:32.026
Is the money ready?

592
00:34:32.626 --> 00:34:34.796
I only got 600,000 dollars.

593
00:34:34.836 --> 00:34:36.807
Can't you just take that?

594
00:34:37.137 --> 00:34:40.736
If you don't make 700,000, I'll leak the photos.

595
00:34:41.276 --> 00:34:43.847
I can't get any more money.

596
00:34:43.847 --> 00:34:46.347
I am going to leak the photos then.

597
00:34:47.876 --> 00:34:50.316
You don't need to hear more. It's waste of time.

598
00:34:51.687 --> 00:34:55.017
In fact, the whole thing started because of her.

599
00:34:56.387 --> 00:34:58.086
This lady.

600
00:34:58.187 --> 00:34:59.227
What?

601
00:34:59.256 --> 00:35:03.327
It was so obvious you were into me.

602
00:35:03.327 --> 00:35:05.097
He's my husband.

603
00:35:06.227 --> 00:35:08.796
Just shut your mouth.

604
00:35:09.497 --> 00:35:11.707
You didn't learn your lessons yet.

605
00:35:12.006 --> 00:35:14.537
How could the frauds blame the victim?

606
00:35:15.406 --> 00:35:17.906
She was just too innocent.

607
00:35:17.906 --> 00:35:21.147
Unlike you, she's not cunning.

608
00:35:21.147 --> 00:35:22.776
Okay. I get it.

609
00:35:23.986 --> 00:35:25.847
If you turn me over to the police,

610
00:35:26.187 --> 00:35:29.086
I'll leak the news about Haesung's new daughter.

611
00:35:34.126 --> 00:35:35.126
Hey.

612
00:35:35.526 --> 00:35:39.327
Just go leak the news, you idiot.

613
00:35:40.296 --> 00:35:43.707
You signed the note of confidentiality.

614
00:35:43.707 --> 00:35:46.466
Can you even afford the penalty? Can you?

615
00:35:47.977 --> 00:35:50.207
We don't have any money.

616
00:35:52.046 --> 00:35:53.247
It's not just about money.

617
00:35:53.477 --> 00:35:55.477
People from Haesung Group won't let it slide.

618
00:35:55.477 --> 00:35:57.517
It won't be just three years in jail.

619
00:35:58.946 --> 00:36:01.287
You'd end up being buried in the ground.

620
00:36:03.557 --> 00:36:05.057
I take that back.

621
00:36:05.656 --> 00:36:08.057
Gosh, this punk.

622
00:36:10.667 --> 00:36:13.836
So what will happen to us now?

623
00:36:38.727 --> 00:36:39.856
Mister.

624
00:36:40.497 --> 00:36:41.957
Are you all right?

625
00:36:42.057 --> 00:36:43.867
Yes, I'm okay.

626
00:36:43.867 --> 00:36:45.426
You look sick.

627
00:36:46.167 --> 00:36:47.566
You have a fever.

628
00:36:48.236 --> 00:36:50.367
You've been wandering around night and day.

629
00:36:50.767 --> 00:36:52.267
You'd be very sick.

630
00:36:52.267 --> 00:36:54.477
Go home and get some rest. Go take some medicine.

631
00:36:55.477 --> 00:36:57.707
Is there a pharmacy near here?

632
00:36:59.446 --> 00:37:00.477
Here.

633
00:37:05.986 --> 00:37:07.316
I'm home.

634
00:37:08.457 --> 00:37:12.227
I knew you were pretty, but you look much better.

635
00:37:13.827 --> 00:37:14.926
You look good.

636
00:37:17.426 --> 00:37:19.296
You got a complete makeover.

637
00:37:22.196 --> 00:37:23.307
So how was it?

638
00:37:23.566 --> 00:37:25.667
- What? - How did you feel?

639
00:37:26.466 --> 00:37:30.106
The massage was good, and I liked my new hair.

640
00:37:30.347 --> 00:37:32.747
I don't like this dress though. It's not my thing.

641
00:37:35.247 --> 00:37:38.046
Why? You don't like it?

642
00:37:38.046 --> 00:37:39.486
No, that's not it.

643
00:37:40.156 --> 00:37:43.756
I was just coming home, so I thought all this...

644
00:37:43.756 --> 00:37:46.457
makeup and new clothes were a bit too much.

645
00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:48.426
You're our family now,

646
00:37:48.926 --> 00:37:52.126
so I wanted everything to be perfect.

647
00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:55.566
I didn't have time to prepare things before.

648
00:38:04.077 --> 00:38:07.446
First, I want to celebrate that Eun Seok is back.

649
00:38:07.776 --> 00:38:09.077
Hold on.

650
00:38:10.387 --> 00:38:14.387
I'm sorry, but I'm not back as Eun Seok.

651
00:38:14.656 --> 00:38:16.356
Why are you doing this?

652
00:38:16.986 --> 00:38:18.227
You're Eun Seok.

653
00:38:18.486 --> 00:38:20.557
Who else do you think would be Eun Seok then?

654
00:38:21.057 --> 00:38:23.367
No, I'm not Eun Seok.

655
00:38:23.626 --> 00:38:24.867
I'm Seo Ji Soo.

656
00:38:25.097 --> 00:38:27.767
I don't want you to call me Eun Seok.

657
00:38:29.296 --> 00:38:30.336
Hey.

658
00:38:30.437 --> 00:38:32.066
Let's skip the toast.

659
00:38:32.767 --> 00:38:34.207
We were overhasty.

660
00:38:34.776 --> 00:38:36.037
Let's just have dinner together.

661
00:38:38.147 --> 00:38:39.307
Okay.

662
00:38:40.347 --> 00:38:41.347
Let's eat.

663
00:38:49.316 --> 00:38:52.126
Ji Soo, that fork is for salad.

664
00:38:52.586 --> 00:38:53.756
So what?

665
00:38:54.026 --> 00:38:56.097
You should use the fork for meat instead.

666
00:38:56.497 --> 00:38:58.897
What's wrong with this? I don't care about it.

667
00:39:00.497 --> 00:39:02.667
It's called table manners.

668
00:39:02.667 --> 00:39:04.207
There are rules about cutlery.

669
00:39:04.767 --> 00:39:06.336
I know that.

670
00:39:06.606 --> 00:39:10.446
But I'm home. Why would I care about that at home?

671
00:39:10.446 --> 00:39:11.647
No one's watching me.

672
00:39:17.787 --> 00:39:18.917
Ji Soo.

673
00:39:20.517 --> 00:39:21.887
I'm sorry.

674
00:39:21.887 --> 00:39:23.526
It was just so funny.

675
00:39:23.756 --> 00:39:26.356
I'm home, but people are standing around us.

676
00:39:26.557 --> 00:39:29.356
And I'm all dressed up just to have dinner.

677
00:39:30.267 --> 00:39:32.296
It's just so funny. It's strange.

678
00:39:33.767 --> 00:39:35.296
Did you just say it's funny?

679
00:39:35.296 --> 00:39:36.566
Yes.

680
00:39:37.307 --> 00:39:39.336
Each family has their own culture.

681
00:39:40.137 --> 00:39:42.707
It's rude of you to laugh loudly at the table.

682
00:39:42.977 --> 00:39:46.046
Oh, I see. That's how things are here.

683
00:39:54.887 --> 00:39:56.316
Excuse me.

684
00:39:56.316 --> 00:39:59.156
Can I get some ketchup and steak sauce?

685
00:39:59.287 --> 00:40:01.097
You have the special sauce in your plate.

686
00:40:01.626 --> 00:40:05.267
It's too bland. I prefer bulgogi over steak.

687
00:40:05.466 --> 00:40:07.637
Bulgogi and stir-fried spicy pork.

688
00:40:07.736 --> 00:40:09.397
I don't like bland dishes.

689
00:40:12.937 --> 00:40:14.077
Honey.

690
00:40:15.137 --> 00:40:16.406
She's so cute.

691
00:40:21.147 --> 00:40:22.417
Thank you.

692
00:41:19.137 --> 00:41:21.477
(Welcome to Canada!)

693
00:41:24.276 --> 00:41:25.477
Canada?

694
00:41:26.347 --> 00:41:27.517
Emigration?

695
00:41:36.017 --> 00:41:37.156
I'm home.

696
00:41:39.856 --> 00:41:41.256
Where's Soo A?

697
00:41:41.926 --> 00:41:44.327
She's working late, so I came home first.

698
00:41:44.466 --> 00:41:45.526
Did you eat dinner?

699
00:41:45.926 --> 00:41:47.736
- Yes. - Ji Tae.

700
00:41:49.196 --> 00:41:50.307
Yes?

701
00:41:50.606 --> 00:41:53.336
Are you interested in emigration?

702
00:41:56.406 --> 00:41:58.247
Did you search my room?

703
00:41:58.946 --> 00:42:00.046
What?

704
00:42:00.247 --> 00:42:02.446
I didn't search your room. I found...

705
00:42:02.446 --> 00:42:04.486
Why did you even come upstairs?

706
00:42:07.557 --> 00:42:09.517
Yes, I looked into it.

707
00:42:11.156 --> 00:42:13.856
How could you, without discussing with me?

708
00:42:13.856 --> 00:42:15.597
Did you discuss with us?

709
00:42:15.926 --> 00:42:17.566
Did you ask us...

710
00:42:17.566 --> 00:42:19.227
before swapping my sisters?

711
00:42:19.466 --> 00:42:21.537
That was...

712
00:42:22.097 --> 00:42:24.466
Yes, I want to emigrate.

713
00:42:24.836 --> 00:42:25.966
I plan to.

714
00:42:25.966 --> 00:42:27.276
Why should I...

715
00:42:27.276 --> 00:42:28.736
discuss that with you?

716
00:42:29.037 --> 00:42:31.077
I'm an adult. I'm married.

717
00:42:31.077 --> 00:42:33.617
Who was the one that forced me to marry?

718
00:42:34.446 --> 00:42:35.617
Now we're married,

719
00:42:35.617 --> 00:42:37.887
I'm too embarrassed to face my own wife.

720
00:42:38.216 --> 00:42:41.486
That's why I want to leave this house.

721
00:42:42.057 --> 00:42:45.126
I want to be able to breathe for once.

722
00:42:48.426 --> 00:42:49.597
Ji Tae.

723
00:43:06.747 --> 00:43:08.376
What was that about?

724
00:43:09.316 --> 00:43:10.417
What?

725
00:43:10.486 --> 00:43:11.546
"What?"

726
00:43:12.147 --> 00:43:14.017
Did you decide to emigrate?

727
00:43:14.017 --> 00:43:15.917
Without a word to me?

728
00:43:16.586 --> 00:43:17.986
I said that because I was upset.

729
00:43:19.156 --> 00:43:21.296
Are you allowed to be rash if you're upset?

730
00:43:21.856 --> 00:43:23.626
What are you so upset about?

731
00:43:24.296 --> 00:43:25.696
Isn't that obvious?

732
00:43:26.026 --> 00:43:27.466
I'm frustrated, that's all.

733
00:43:27.736 --> 00:43:29.537
What did you say when we were in Canada?

734
00:43:29.966 --> 00:43:32.236
Marriage is about living apart from your family.

735
00:43:32.236 --> 00:43:33.637
That's what you wanted.

736
00:43:34.707 --> 00:43:37.247
Marriage is about forming our own family.

737
00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:38.747
I know that, but...

738
00:43:39.847 --> 00:43:41.147
I lose control...

739
00:43:41.647 --> 00:43:43.147
when I see my parents.

740
00:43:44.986 --> 00:43:46.117
Let's move out.

741
00:43:47.787 --> 00:43:50.426
If living here is giving you such a hard time,

742
00:43:50.827 --> 00:43:52.287
we should move out.

743
00:43:53.227 --> 00:43:54.557
Out of sight,

744
00:43:54.557 --> 00:43:55.957
out of mind.

745
00:43:57.296 --> 00:43:59.526
Okay. Let's do that.

746
00:44:29.457 --> 00:44:31.026
Hello?

747
00:44:31.267 --> 00:44:32.426
Tae Soo.

748
00:44:36.466 --> 00:44:37.506
Seok...

749
00:44:38.906 --> 00:44:40.176
Seok Doo.

750
00:44:40.906 --> 00:44:42.876
What's wrong with your voice?

751
00:44:47.216 --> 00:44:49.316
It's just so hard.

752
00:44:51.517 --> 00:44:53.147
I feel miserable.

753
00:44:54.787 --> 00:44:56.586
I'm so afraid.

754
00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:03.926
How could this happen?

755
00:45:04.727 --> 00:45:05.966
How...

756
00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:10.307
How could she not text or call me?

757
00:45:11.707 --> 00:45:13.577
My wife told me.

758
00:45:14.376 --> 00:45:16.537
You still haven't heard from her?

759
00:45:24.046 --> 00:45:25.216
No.

760
00:45:26.316 --> 00:45:27.756
I don't even know if...

761
00:45:28.287 --> 00:45:30.687
she's dead or alive.

762
00:46:13.867 --> 00:46:15.066
In fact,

763
00:46:15.336 --> 00:46:17.867
the whole thing started because of her.

764
00:46:18.006 --> 00:46:20.376
It was so obvious you were into me.

765
00:46:23.776 --> 00:46:25.077
Was that a reason...

766
00:46:26.577 --> 00:46:27.946
to defraud me?

767
00:46:32.017 --> 00:46:33.656
- Hey. - Did Ms. Min...

768
00:46:35.017 --> 00:46:36.086
Hey.

769
00:46:38.187 --> 00:46:39.387
What are you doing?

770
00:46:39.387 --> 00:46:41.796
You can't barge in without my permission.

771
00:46:42.426 --> 00:46:43.997
I knocked.

772
00:46:43.997 --> 00:46:45.327
You knock to ask for...

773
00:46:45.327 --> 00:46:46.796
permission to enter.

774
00:46:47.466 --> 00:46:48.796
You're really weird.

775
00:46:48.796 --> 00:46:50.966
Why do sisters need permission?

776
00:46:50.966 --> 00:46:53.307
Not even my parents enter without it.

777
00:46:53.406 --> 00:46:55.537
I even shared a room with my sister.

778
00:46:55.537 --> 00:46:57.006
We changed in front of each other...

779
00:46:57.006 --> 00:46:58.477
and slept together.

780
00:47:01.477 --> 00:47:04.247
And you're so very different.

781
00:47:05.046 --> 00:47:06.046
What?

782
00:47:06.046 --> 00:47:08.617
You're very different from the other Eun Seok.

783
00:47:09.486 --> 00:47:11.287
The old one's always better.

784
00:47:11.856 --> 00:47:13.696
What does that mean?

785
00:47:13.696 --> 00:47:15.397
The other Eun Seok...

786
00:47:15.397 --> 00:47:16.497
learned manners...

787
00:47:16.497 --> 00:47:17.696
that suited our family.

788
00:47:17.696 --> 00:47:19.327
She understood what she learned,

789
00:47:19.327 --> 00:47:21.236
and my parents adored her.

790
00:47:22.796 --> 00:47:24.336
She even captivated my grandpa,

791
00:47:24.336 --> 00:47:26.006
and he called her his bloodline.

792
00:47:26.006 --> 00:47:28.807
Are you praising your fake sister?

793
00:47:28.807 --> 00:47:30.347
Because she deserves it.

794
00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:31.577
She was so nice,

795
00:47:32.707 --> 00:47:34.477
and I'd grown to like her.

796
00:47:46.696 --> 00:47:48.026
Ms. Min.

797
00:47:49.526 --> 00:47:50.696
Did you call for me?

798
00:47:50.696 --> 00:47:52.867
Why did you swap my toothbrush without asking?

799
00:47:53.236 --> 00:47:54.267
Do educated people...

800
00:47:54.267 --> 00:47:56.196
touch others' belongings like that?

801
00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:59.937
I changed it because I thought it was worn.

802
00:48:00.106 --> 00:48:01.836
I brought it from home...

803
00:48:01.836 --> 00:48:03.876
because I'd only used it for two days.

804
00:48:04.106 --> 00:48:06.676
I apologize. I guess I was mistaken.

805
00:48:06.816 --> 00:48:08.946
Was it because it was cheap?

806
00:48:08.946 --> 00:48:11.347
I don't like these kind of toothbrushes.

807
00:48:11.986 --> 00:48:13.457
I apologize, miss.

808
00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:16.316
You don't have to apologize so much.

809
00:48:17.457 --> 00:48:19.187
From now on, can you...

810
00:48:19.187 --> 00:48:21.057
not call me "miss"?

811
00:48:32.466 --> 00:48:33.606
Mr. Choi.

812
00:48:35.106 --> 00:48:36.906
I'm glad my wife left early...

813
00:48:36.906 --> 00:48:38.647
for a breakfast meeting.

814
00:48:48.387 --> 00:48:50.856
Why did you swap my toothbrush without asking?

815
00:48:51.957 --> 00:48:53.696
I brought it from home...

816
00:48:53.696 --> 00:48:55.656
because I'd only used it for two days.

817
00:49:02.897 --> 00:49:04.137
Who are you?

818
00:49:16.716 --> 00:49:20.486
We're used to seeing your wife.

819
00:49:20.486 --> 00:49:21.917
Why are you here?

820
00:49:22.986 --> 00:49:24.626
Let's cut to the chase.

821
00:49:25.187 --> 00:49:27.457
Tell me exactly what you told my wife.

822
00:49:28.126 --> 00:49:30.597
From when you took Eun Seok 25 years ago.

823
00:49:33.026 --> 00:49:35.767
She told us not to tell anyone else.

824
00:49:35.997 --> 00:49:38.367
I'm the father of the child you kidnapped.

825
00:49:38.707 --> 00:49:42.537
We really were going to put the girl back...

826
00:49:42.537 --> 00:49:45.807
in the car after taking the diamonds.

827
00:49:52.086 --> 00:49:53.417
I thought she knew.

828
00:49:54.187 --> 00:49:57.227
I froze on the spot with fear,

829
00:49:59.787 --> 00:50:03.466
but Ms. No just zoomed straight past me.

830
00:50:04.097 --> 00:50:06.637
I was standing there holding the girl.

831
00:50:06.667 --> 00:50:09.466
Yes. I saw it from inside our car.

832
00:50:10.066 --> 00:50:12.707
I thought we'd been found out.

833
00:50:13.137 --> 00:50:14.137
Right?

834
00:50:14.736 --> 00:50:16.236
What else should I do...

835
00:50:16.236 --> 00:50:18.446
when we're about to become kidnappers?

836
00:50:19.176 --> 00:50:21.577
We only planned on stealing.

837
00:50:21.577 --> 00:50:24.747
Kidnapping was not our intent, sir.

838
00:50:28.187 --> 00:50:29.517
What is it?

839
00:50:29.656 --> 00:50:31.926
Did you test Ji Soo's DNA...

840
00:50:31.926 --> 00:50:33.227
with her toothbrush?

841
00:50:35.227 --> 00:50:36.356
I did.

842
00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.227
I wanted to be sure.

843
00:50:38.227 --> 00:50:40.167
I didn't want to make another mistake.

844
00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:41.466
You tested it?

845
00:50:42.466 --> 00:50:44.466
I took the toothbrushes Jo Soon Ok gave me,

846
00:50:44.466 --> 00:50:46.037
and I believed Yang Mi Jung.

847
00:50:46.037 --> 00:50:48.477
That got us into a world of trouble.

848
00:50:48.807 --> 00:50:50.176
I thought that maybe...

849
00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:52.946
Jo Soon Ok had tampered with them.

850
00:50:55.647 --> 00:50:58.187
Now we confirmed Ji Soo is Eun Seok...

851
00:50:58.187 --> 00:50:59.816
She must be trained.

852
00:51:01.887 --> 00:51:02.957
Yes.

853
00:51:08.796 --> 00:51:09.997
You're leaving?

854
00:51:11.167 --> 00:51:12.167
Yes.

855
00:51:12.397 --> 00:51:14.037
You've been acting...

856
00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:16.497
strangely for quite a while.

857
00:51:16.836 --> 00:51:18.207
May I ask why?

858
00:51:20.876 --> 00:51:22.707
The girl that you...

859
00:51:23.006 --> 00:51:25.946
accepted wholeheartedly turned out...

860
00:51:26.577 --> 00:51:28.517
not to be our daughter.

861
00:51:29.517 --> 00:51:32.147
Did you hope Ji Soo wasn't either?

862
00:51:35.517 --> 00:51:36.787
Do you think...

863
00:51:36.787 --> 00:51:38.827
your daughter was born noble?

864
00:51:40.227 --> 00:51:42.156
How can you say that?

865
00:51:42.156 --> 00:51:43.466
I'm glad it's a no.

866
00:51:55.336 --> 00:51:58.247
You're handsome and a great worker.

867
00:51:58.247 --> 00:51:59.477
- Right. - Thank you.

868
00:51:59.477 --> 00:52:02.816
We all just love you, you know.

869
00:52:02.816 --> 00:52:04.546
- Don't we? - We do.

870
00:52:04.546 --> 00:52:05.946
- A drink later? - Soju?

871
00:52:05.946 --> 00:52:07.356
- Sure. - Sounds great.

872
00:52:07.957 --> 00:52:10.086
Young man.

873
00:52:10.457 --> 00:52:11.626
Yes?

874
00:52:11.926 --> 00:52:14.457
Can you help us strip the dry seaweed?

875
00:52:14.597 --> 00:52:16.296
- Oh dear. - Yes, sir.

876
00:52:16.727 --> 00:52:18.066
He's so popular.

877
00:52:18.066 --> 00:52:19.767
- I won't be long. - Okay.

878
00:52:19.767 --> 00:52:22.696
Come back. You're supposed to help us.

879
00:52:22.867 --> 00:52:27.336
Oh dear. Poor Hyuk might throw out his back.

880
00:52:28.336 --> 00:52:30.347
That's nothing for me.

881
00:52:30.906 --> 00:52:33.477
- I'm really okay. - Sorry.

882
00:52:34.617 --> 00:52:35.647
Are you okay?

883
00:52:42.856 --> 00:52:45.057
- Give me five minutes. - Okay.

884
00:52:45.057 --> 00:52:46.287
Hurry back.

885
00:52:59.537 --> 00:53:00.876
Will you really not go home?

886
00:53:01.506 --> 00:53:02.707
I brought a suitcase.

887
00:53:02.977 --> 00:53:04.046
What for?

888
00:53:04.577 --> 00:53:07.376
What are you doing here? Why should you be here?

889
00:53:08.716 --> 00:53:10.387
Stop it and go home.

890
00:53:10.747 --> 00:53:12.347
This isn't your job.

891
00:53:12.647 --> 00:53:14.816
What about you? Is it yours?

892
00:53:15.687 --> 00:53:16.687
Hyuk.

893
00:53:17.626 --> 00:53:18.957
I like the work.

894
00:53:19.187 --> 00:53:22.397
It's simple, but I focus and it distracts me.

895
00:53:23.397 --> 00:53:24.397
Ji An.

896
00:53:25.267 --> 00:53:27.867
Say you were in my shoes...

897
00:53:28.437 --> 00:53:30.506
and you saw me in your situation.

898
00:53:30.906 --> 00:53:33.637
If I told you to go home, would you?

899
00:53:33.807 --> 00:53:34.906
Of course.

900
00:53:36.176 --> 00:53:37.247
Liar.

901
00:53:39.676 --> 00:53:41.276
You're a great liar.

902
00:53:42.216 --> 00:53:43.687
Even in high school.

903
00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:47.216
You lied when you taught me how to saw.

904
00:53:48.356 --> 00:53:49.517
"Not bad."

905
00:53:49.957 --> 00:53:52.256
"You're good. You're useful, Hyuk."

906
00:53:54.457 --> 00:53:56.597
When I made my first box,

907
00:53:57.066 --> 00:53:58.267
you lied then too.

908
00:53:59.227 --> 00:54:00.336
"Yours is better than mine."

909
00:54:00.696 --> 00:54:02.267
Yours was much better.

910
00:54:03.066 --> 00:54:04.566
Why are you mentioning that?

911
00:54:04.937 --> 00:54:07.037
Your lies gave me confidence.

912
00:54:09.137 --> 00:54:10.446
You were awesome then.

913
00:54:11.546 --> 00:54:14.816
You could saw, hammer nails, draw things,

914
00:54:15.816 --> 00:54:17.517
and you got good grades.

915
00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:19.446
You fought well, smiled...

916
00:54:19.446 --> 00:54:21.457
Stop it, I don't want to listen.

917
00:54:22.017 --> 00:54:23.787
When you complimented me,

918
00:54:24.287 --> 00:54:27.457
I wondered if I could do better at something.

919
00:54:28.397 --> 00:54:30.667
So I tried harder to earn more compliments.

920
00:54:31.196 --> 00:54:32.566
Then carpentry became fun.

921
00:54:32.897 --> 00:54:36.066
When I realized that, you said something.

922
00:54:37.006 --> 00:54:39.606
If I take woodwork classes or study interior design,

923
00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:41.637
I can do all sorts of things with wood.

924
00:54:42.077 --> 00:54:43.477
Why are you saying that?

925
00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:45.977
Let's say I said all that then.

926
00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:49.216
Is that reason for you to act like a stalker?

927
00:54:49.347 --> 00:54:50.687
It's more than enough.

928
00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:53.457
Will you please let me explain why?

929
00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:57.656
You know...

930
00:54:58.926 --> 00:54:59.926
my mom...

931
00:55:01.397 --> 00:55:03.126
was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer...

932
00:55:03.126 --> 00:55:04.426
when I was in elementary school.

933
00:55:06.327 --> 00:55:08.696
She begged my sister to get married...

934
00:55:10.667 --> 00:55:11.667
and died soon afterwards.

935
00:55:13.137 --> 00:55:14.736
My dad became an alcoholic.

936
00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:20.117
What kind of a life do you think I had?

937
00:55:21.676 --> 00:55:22.747
I was so lonely.

938
00:55:25.316 --> 00:55:28.316
I was the school bully and a huge troublemaker.

939
00:55:28.756 --> 00:55:30.287
You know I was forced to...

940
00:55:30.287 --> 00:55:31.827
take carpentry in high school.

941
00:55:32.656 --> 00:55:35.397
But I enjoyed it and found my dream.

942
00:55:36.097 --> 00:55:37.126
Don't you remember...

943
00:55:37.296 --> 00:55:39.867
how we spent a whole year in the woodwork room?

944
00:55:40.196 --> 00:55:43.196
We made all sorts of things for an exhibition.

945
00:55:44.437 --> 00:55:46.106
I don't care about your past.

946
00:55:46.807 --> 00:55:47.977
It's your past too.

947
00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:50.747
I hate my past! It means nothing.

948
00:55:51.406 --> 00:55:53.446
"Go back to when you were cool."

949
00:55:53.776 --> 00:55:55.216
That's what you want to say.

950
00:55:55.216 --> 00:55:56.417
It's not that.

951
00:55:56.946 --> 00:55:57.946
I'm explaining...

952
00:55:58.417 --> 00:56:01.187
why I just can't leave you here on your own.

953
00:56:02.086 --> 00:56:03.327
Would you leave...

954
00:56:03.887 --> 00:56:05.426
a friend like that behind?

955
00:56:05.756 --> 00:56:06.957
Could you?

956
00:56:09.856 --> 00:56:11.066
I could.

957
00:56:11.767 --> 00:56:13.397
Yes, I can.

958
00:56:13.566 --> 00:56:14.597
I can't.

959
00:56:15.997 --> 00:56:18.307
That's why even if you yell and beg,

960
00:56:19.267 --> 00:56:20.776
I can't leave you here.

961
00:56:22.437 --> 00:56:24.046
If I knew your family's number...

962
00:56:24.446 --> 00:56:26.446
But you won't give it to me.

963
00:56:27.077 --> 00:56:28.577
You won't let me call Choi Do Kyung...

964
00:56:28.577 --> 00:56:30.117
who does know their number.

965
00:56:30.986 --> 00:56:33.117
That's why I must become your guardian.

966
00:56:33.187 --> 00:56:34.316
Hyuk.

967
00:56:35.486 --> 00:56:37.457
I don't need a guardian.

968
00:56:37.457 --> 00:56:39.256
Then live like you don't need one.

969
00:56:39.887 --> 00:56:41.926
You aren't dead. You're alive.

970
00:56:42.126 --> 00:56:43.727
Why live like you're dead?

971
00:56:44.497 --> 00:56:46.997
What's your plan? Do you have one?

972
00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:48.937
I don't.

973
00:56:49.597 --> 00:56:51.937
I didn't think. I don't want to think.

974
00:56:52.006 --> 00:56:53.437
That's a dead person.

975
00:56:54.276 --> 00:56:56.106
Someone pretending to be dead to survive.

976
00:56:57.606 --> 00:56:58.647
What?

977
00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:02.876
You're right by the sea.

978
00:57:03.347 --> 00:57:04.617
You won't go in.

979
00:57:05.247 --> 00:57:08.356
You could've died many times, but you didn't.

980
00:57:08.557 --> 00:57:09.756
You want to live.

981
00:57:13.397 --> 00:57:15.457
Call your parents, come with me,

982
00:57:16.296 --> 00:57:19.296
or let me stay with you, choose one.

983
00:57:20.897 --> 00:57:22.167
Do you like simple work?

984
00:57:23.236 --> 00:57:24.537
I'll let you work.

985
00:57:49.827 --> 00:57:51.597
Ji An is safe and well.

986
00:58:00.037 --> 00:58:01.577
If she's well,

987
00:58:03.946 --> 00:58:05.577
why isn't she back?

988
00:58:16.957 --> 00:58:19.057
- Mr. Choi. - What?

989
00:58:19.526 --> 00:58:23.597
I'll report back because you told me to...

990
00:58:24.796 --> 00:58:25.897
What is it?

991
00:58:25.897 --> 00:58:27.867
The location of Seo Ji An's phone.

992
00:58:29.437 --> 00:58:31.506
It went dead a week ago,

993
00:58:31.566 --> 00:58:34.207
but it was last located in Incheon.

994
00:58:35.336 --> 00:58:37.676
- Where in Incheon? - Will you go?

995
00:58:38.446 --> 00:58:41.077
What for when her friend will be there?

996
00:58:42.316 --> 00:58:43.946
I need to see what happened...

997
00:58:44.347 --> 00:58:45.747
and if she's safe.

998
00:58:45.946 --> 00:58:47.187
I just want to check.

999
00:58:48.387 --> 00:58:49.986
Text me the location.

1000
00:58:54.997 --> 00:58:56.997
I have a bad feeling about this.

1001
00:58:59.937 --> 00:59:02.497
This is the first time she took a break.

1002
00:59:03.367 --> 00:59:05.307
Something must be wrong.

1003
00:59:05.867 --> 00:59:07.807
Someone pretending to be dead to survive.

1004
00:59:08.577 --> 00:59:10.676
Call your parents, come with me,

1005
00:59:11.647 --> 00:59:13.077
or let me stay with you.

1006
00:59:13.847 --> 00:59:14.917
Choose one.

1007
01:00:33.957 --> 01:00:35.997
Ma'am, where did she go?

1008
01:00:36.227 --> 01:00:40.097
She took all her belongings and left.

1009
01:00:40.267 --> 01:00:43.736
I wondered how she was, but she looked brighter.

1010
01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:45.267
- Did she? - Yes.

1011
01:00:46.836 --> 01:00:48.707
- Hurry after her. - See you.

1012
01:00:48.707 --> 01:00:50.307
Go on, then.

1013
01:00:50.307 --> 01:00:51.807
Go on.

1014
01:00:51.807 --> 01:00:53.176
Excuse me.

1015
01:00:54.316 --> 01:00:55.347
Did you...

1016
01:00:57.117 --> 01:00:58.446
see this person somewhere?

1017
01:01:01.256 --> 01:01:03.387
- No. - I haven't seen her.

1018
01:01:19.207 --> 01:01:20.437
Excuse me.

1019
01:01:21.307 --> 01:01:24.577
Have you seen her?

1020
01:01:24.906 --> 01:01:28.276
Yes, I saw her over there.

1021
01:01:29.017 --> 01:01:30.046
You saw her?

1022
01:01:30.046 --> 01:01:32.887
Yes, when I dropped off the squid.

1023
01:01:32.887 --> 01:01:35.387
I think she was drying seaweed.

1024
01:01:36.057 --> 01:01:39.057
She looked different from that photo.

1025
01:01:39.057 --> 01:01:40.397
Drying seaweed?

1026
01:01:40.656 --> 01:01:41.827
Where do they do that?

1027
01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:50.867
Ji An.

1028
01:02:01.847 --> 01:02:03.017
Hyuk.

1029
01:02:06.446 --> 01:02:07.517
Let's go.

1030
01:02:08.617 --> 01:02:11.156
Sure. Let's go.

1031
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:26.180
<font face="Papyrus" color="#00ff00">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font>

1032
01:02:33.207 --> 01:02:34.577
Excuse me.

1033
01:02:35.446 --> 01:02:36.546
By any chance,

1034
01:02:37.747 --> 01:02:40.256
does this woman work here?

1035
01:02:40.787 --> 01:02:41.887
Isn't that Ms. Seo?

1036
01:02:42.287 --> 01:02:44.256
That's Ms. Seo.

1037
01:02:44.256 --> 01:02:46.486
She looks different in the picture.

1038
01:02:47.526 --> 01:02:49.026
Where's she now?

1039
01:02:49.026 --> 01:02:50.966
She packed up and left.

1040
01:02:50.997 --> 01:02:53.637
Men keep looking for her. What's going on?

1041
01:02:54.796 --> 01:02:56.137
She must be...

1042
01:02:56.137 --> 01:02:57.437
femme fatale.

1043
01:02:58.066 --> 01:03:00.937
She attracts men like a squid net.

1044
01:03:03.176 --> 01:03:05.147
So who's the boyfriend?

1045
01:03:05.276 --> 01:03:06.577
Ji An...

1046
01:03:08.276 --> 01:03:09.477
worked here?

1047
01:03:15.287 --> 01:03:16.887
It's your pay until now.

1048
01:03:17.256 --> 01:03:18.656
No.

1049
01:03:18.656 --> 01:03:20.457
There's nothing...

1050
01:03:20.457 --> 01:03:22.126
after the hospital and meal cost.

1051
01:03:22.497 --> 01:03:23.966
You even bought me clothes.

1052
01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.827
I took out the hospital cost.

1053
01:03:25.827 --> 01:03:27.966
I provide meal and housing...

1054
01:03:27.966 --> 01:03:29.696
to workers.

1055
01:03:30.037 --> 01:03:31.966
You made some money...

1056
01:03:31.966 --> 01:03:33.477
because you worked...

1057
01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:35.276
harder than anybody else.

1058
01:03:35.276 --> 01:03:37.477
Take it. Here.

1059
01:03:42.316 --> 01:03:43.517
Thank you.

1060
01:03:44.417 --> 01:03:46.917
You thank a corrupt owner like me?

1061
01:03:48.957 --> 01:03:52.387
I know you kept me on purpose.

1062
01:03:52.887 --> 01:03:54.296
You do?

1063
01:03:56.526 --> 01:03:57.727
You cooked...

1064
01:03:59.497 --> 01:04:01.597
good food for me for every meal.

1065
01:04:03.637 --> 01:04:05.637
Why did you do that...

1066
01:04:07.106 --> 01:04:08.977
when you don't even know me?

1067
01:04:09.876 --> 01:04:12.546
I have a long story.

1068
01:04:19.046 --> 01:04:21.716
I attempted suicide for the last time...

1069
01:04:22.316 --> 01:04:24.086
at bed and breakfast,

1070
01:04:24.787 --> 01:04:26.597
but I couldn't die...

1071
01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:28.097
because she saved me.

1072
01:04:29.526 --> 01:04:30.897
I shouldn't have saved him.

1073
01:04:30.897 --> 01:04:33.066
He's suffering from taking care of me.

1074
01:04:34.167 --> 01:04:35.997
I have Evans syndrome.

1075
01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.466
I make him work hard...

1076
01:04:37.466 --> 01:04:39.267
for the hospital cost,

1077
01:04:39.336 --> 01:04:40.807
and people call him cheap.

1078
01:04:42.276 --> 01:04:43.847
People live...

1079
01:04:44.307 --> 01:04:46.207
for various reasons.

1080
01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:49.446
People die for another.

1081
01:04:49.617 --> 01:04:51.387
People live for another.

1082
01:04:53.287 --> 01:04:54.316
Yes.

1083
01:04:54.656 --> 01:04:56.986
I used to wear this.

1084
01:04:57.156 --> 01:04:58.986
It's cold now.

1085
01:04:59.486 --> 01:05:01.897
I bought that for you last year.

1086
01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:03.966
It was a big decision.

1087
01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.066
Go ahead.

1088
01:05:05.066 --> 01:05:06.367
You're lucky.

1089
01:05:07.196 --> 01:05:08.296
Thank you.

1090
01:05:13.937 --> 01:05:15.336
Thank you.

1091
01:05:16.176 --> 01:05:17.347
Thank you very much.

1092
01:05:18.776 --> 01:05:20.216
Take care of yourself.

1093
01:05:20.977 --> 01:05:22.647
Give me a call...

1094
01:05:23.216 --> 01:05:24.887
to say you're good.

1095
01:05:25.287 --> 01:05:26.417
Yes.

1096
01:05:28.316 --> 01:05:29.457
Please...

1097
01:05:30.356 --> 01:05:31.687
stay healthy.

1098
01:05:48.207 --> 01:05:50.147
Many people live there.

1099
01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:51.606
You don't need to worry about it.

1100
01:05:52.347 --> 01:05:53.446
Okay.

1101
01:06:05.756 --> 01:06:07.497
She got here by a truck.

1102
01:06:42.156 --> 01:06:43.267
Seo Ji An.

1103
01:06:43.997 --> 01:06:44.997
Get off.
