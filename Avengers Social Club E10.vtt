<i>Corrections by Uncle Andy</i>

3
00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:10.960
Ajusshi?

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.400
What does that mean?
Who is it?

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.440
Episode 10 What does that mean?
Who is it?

6
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.420
Who is this?
Neighborhood ajusshi

7
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.480
What is that?
What?

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.480
Yah, it's the principal!

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.180
Why is he like that?

10
00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:29.995
They have to see this.
Upload it.

11
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.040
We have to go.
Let's show this. Let's show this.

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:49.480
<i>[Neighborhood leftover ajusshi]</i>

13
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.320
Those kids who took all the pictures,

14
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.000
they'll probably spread it everywhere,
won't they?

15
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.660
It's already been spread everywhere.

16
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.440
Oh!

17
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.360
The children these days are so fast!

18
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.700
But, you know that guy, he must have thought
it was his own living room and slept well.

19
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.020
This seat is still warm.

20
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.840
Then our plan this time,
we've finished it perfectly, haven't we?

21
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.380
There is still one person left.

22
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.500
Go safely and return!

23
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.060
Hyung, where are we going this morning?

24
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.140
We have to go wrap things up.

25
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.000
Yes?

26
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.540
Anyone who knows Kim
Hee Soo in Classroom 3?

27
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.200
What is it?

28
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.080
You know his mother sells fish.

29
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.720
Shall I show you something fun? Huh?

30
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.660
What are you doing? Give it to me.

31
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.000
Yah, yah, yah, yah.

32
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.880
Aren't you going to give it to me?! Yah!

33
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.200
I'll show you something more fun.

34
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.400
Oh, okay,
what can't we talk about between us.

35
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.820
You know my mother.

36
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.340
We lied about it.

37
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.540
This is my uncle's hospital.

38
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.580
Just until the contract teacher
is fired, she told me to lie here.

39
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.880
A dense person caught in his own trap.
<i>("hoisted by his own petard.")</i>

40
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.940
What nonsense are you saying?

41
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.520
Oh.

42
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.480
It means don't mess
around and just lie low.

43
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.720
Anyone interested in the long version,
just ask the main person.

44
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.280
Jung Wook, was that another lie?

45
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.640
Your mother is really amazing.

46
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.480
I feel sorry for the contract teacher.

47
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.600
Hwang Jung Wook, are you so rich?

48
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.200
Yah, what happens if the story of
you being a liar spreads around?

49
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.080
Oh, Hwang Jung Wook.

50
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.280
It looks as if you'll
become an SNS star.

51
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.040
Hey, shhh!

52
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.440
What are you doing?

53
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.960
Are... are you going to upload it?

54
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.060
Why? Are you afr...

55
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.520
What is he doing?

56
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.060
Why is he kneeling?

57
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.120
The reason that I'm kneeling now

58
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.920
is not an acknowledgement that
I did something really wrong.

59
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.060
That is,

60
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.800
I'm not doing this because
I'm afraid or anything.

61
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.680
Pl...

62
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.700
Please just don't upload that anywhere.

63
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.820
Am I you?

64
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.620
You should be saying that to me.

65
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.680
Sunbae-nim.

66
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.660
Please don't upload that anywhere.

67
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.420
That is why, Hoobae-nim,

68
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.540
you would be best served
by not doing anything.

69
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.260
You're really not going to upload that,
right?!

70
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.700
Oh.

71
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.960
I think you are
misunderstanding something.

72
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.240
So I wanted to clear it up for you.

73
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.740
About the building, there's no need
for you to think anything strange.

74
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.320
Just trust me and leave it to me.

75
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.420
Aren't you going out today?

76
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.680
It's just that you seem to be running
around these days doing some fun things.

77
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.780
If you have something to say,
just say it

78
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.000
rather than talking about this and that.

79
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.760
No, it's just that I've been hearing
some funny stories these days.

80
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.740
With Sunbae Baek's wife

81
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.020
and a fishmonger?

82
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.400
We're members of the Avengers Club.

83
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.040
Why?

84
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.720
Oh!

85
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.000
Didn't you show me a strange letter
the other day and said something?

86
00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.920
I asked if you had been playing around.

87
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.840
Who did what...

88
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.920
I heard everything from
Principal Hong Sang Man.

89
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.400
You put glue on his chair,

90
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.260
and you invited the husbands
to eat your strange cooking.

91
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.700
Your imagination is
really beyond anything.

92
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.260
Don't you know what has
happened to that person now?

93
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.720
You have no discernment when it
comes to people, so what will you do?

94
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.600
That... that... the longer I know her...

95
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.920
Wait.

96
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.100
What is she relying on
that she can act that way?

97
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.720
Oh, really.

98
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.020
E-hee. Hong Sang Man.

99
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.780
Pervert.

100
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.600
Mother-in-law, I've co...

101
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.280
How were you able to
come here in the morning?

102
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.420
Speaking of which, what happened to you?

103
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.820
When you had said that you
were going to sleep here.

104
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.080
I had to wash up.

105
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.800
I went to a public bath.

106
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.940
Mother.

107
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.800
Was this person here all night?

108
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.740
Mother.

109
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.880
Don't do it.

110
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.280
Unnie, come here.

111
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.580
Yes.

112
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.280
Yes, I will.

113
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.320
Avengers Club,

114
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.800
were you out doing that again?

115
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.300
Yes?

116
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.280
What in the world are
you running around doing?

117
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.300
I told you already,
it's just a parents group.

118
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.840
Embarrassing the principal,

119
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.940
and slapping the backs of the husbands'
heads,

120
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.360
that is a parents group?

121
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.220
Did the principal say that?

122
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.720
He was right after all.

123
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.960
That's not it.

124
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.560
That person has been going around saying
strange things. That's why I asked.

125
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.420
The incident happened unexpectedly.

126
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.960
And he didn't seem like a
trustworthy person anyway.

127
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.940
Wouldn't it be better for you
to keep your distance as well?

128
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.980
Whatever it is,

129
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.340
can't you not do that strange group?

130
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.500
Yes?

131
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.880
Well, there are the things that you did,
Sunbae.

132
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.640
So being fired was the right thing.

133
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.240
How would I be able to block that?

134
00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.620
Mother-in-law.

135
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.900
Here. Here. This side.

136
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.220
This is the side where the
re-development has been confirmed.

137
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.020
Yes, there, there.

138
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.340
Yes, right, there.

139
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.580
Towards that side, we'll have to pull
the schedule as much as possible,

140
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.740
so the construction will be started
by the beginning of next year.

141
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.900
Now, Brother-in-law.

142
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.900
The only thing left is for
the price of the land to rise.

143
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.320
You're talking as if this was for me.

144
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.100
It's for all of us.

145
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.340
What about Jung Hye?
She doesn't have much to say, does she?

146
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.760
Her? Well, she doesn't have any
interest in things like this.

147
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.020
And even if I told her, she wouldn't
know what I was talking about.

148
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.480
Even if that person hold onto it,
then the General Manager that I am,

149
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.260
if I grow it well,
then she'll just thank me.

150
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.840
Yes?

151
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.680
My wife is with Byung Hoo?

152
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.860
Sister-in-law,
what are you talking about so suddenly?

153
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.540
It's just as I said.

154
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.580
Uh?

155
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.360
What are you doing here, darling?

156
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.340
Secretary Joo is very fast.

157
00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.720
What could you have to say to Byung Hoo
that you came all this way?

158
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.320
I've already signed these, so it's just
left for you to sign, Brother-in-law.

159
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.040
What is it?

160
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.200
My shares of Hae Rang
Construction stock.

161
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.120
I'm giving them to Brother-in-law.

162
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.480
What are you giving?!

163
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.760
Who said you could?!

164
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.060
I said I could.

165
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.620
Do you want me to tell you exactly?

166
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.800
The price paid by Hae Rang
to marry a guy like you,

167
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.940
this is mine!

168
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.800
There is a limit to what a person can do
just because they want to!

169
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.540
Why?

170
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.680
You take whatever of mine that you want.

171
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.220
I'm saying that I'm going to do
what I want with what's mine.

172
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.880
So is there a problem with that?

173
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.040
Sister-in-law, it's completed.

174
00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.500
After I get it registered,
I'll see you again.

175
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:01.880
Yes.

176
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.420
What are you doing?!

177
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.220
Do you want to be embarrassed even
further in front of your little brother?

178
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.240
Yah!

179
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.300
Yah!

180
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.160
Yeobo!

181
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.120
Yeobo!

182
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.700
Whoa... Just a minute.

183
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.420
You're not really going to
give them to him, are you?

184
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.640
Why?

185
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:26.880
You don't like it?

186
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.080
If you give them to him,

187
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.420
then you, me, and even Soo Gyum,
it'll be the end of us all.

188
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.040
It will probably be the end of you.

189
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.140
Anticipate it.

190
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.140
I get it. I understand.

191
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.240
I'll take my hands off.

192
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.240
I will take my hands off your property.

193
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.500
Definitively return all the titles
to how they were before you talk to me.

194
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.520
I understand.

195
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.580
I understand.

196
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.260
I'll return everything to the way
it was, so you have to do well also.

197
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.560
She gave her HaeRang stocks
to Executive Director Lee?

198
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.720
She would be getting back at both Jung
Joon and General Manager Lee in one move.

199
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.980
She's becoming more and more amusing.

200
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.700
We'll talk again.

201
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.120
Yes.

202
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.220
The shares that I have in Geon Ah Group,
I'll turn them over to you.

203
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.980
In order to protect what Lee Byung Soo
wants to steal away from you,

204
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.400
you'll give up something even bigger.

205
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.320
No.

206
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.460
Then the calculation isn't right.

207
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.060
Lee Byung Soo, I'll oppose him.

208
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.340
Then?

209
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.200
If I make a decision,
then I'll tell you.

210
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.760
Oh, such a relief. I feel refreshed!

211
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.220
You did well. You did well.

212
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.580
Our Jung Hye is amazing.

213
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.320
You seem like the rich wife in a drama.

214
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.740
Today it seems to be
even more delicious.

215
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.140
Drink up. Drink up.

216
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.520
Oh right, oppa, we have to buy that.

217
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.620
Uh, okay.

218
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.360
Let's work. Work.

219
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.500
Aigoo, let's work.

220
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.620
Let's work.

221
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.520
Unnie,
you're putting that on the wrong...

222
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.100
Of all things...

223
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.140
Oh!

224
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.660
Here it is.

225
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.300
Oh.

226
00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.920
There is a little flaw in it after all.

227
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.580
Unnie, Unnie, go quickly.

228
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.160
Quickly.

229
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.140
Don't run around too late.

230
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.680
Oppa, you should call Mom
and come home more frequently.

231
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.360
I understand.

232
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.200
Bye!

233
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.820
Oh?

234
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.140
What are you doing here?

235
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.880
Knife.

236
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.980
Knife?

237
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.520
Exactly where does it
need some attention?

238
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.100
Ah.

239
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.800
He...he...here... this side.

240
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.460
It has a notch.

241
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.500
Ah.

242
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.180
I'll grind it down for you on the stone.

243
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:32.980
Will you do that?

244
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.480
Yes.

245
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.300
Just wait a few minutes.
Yes.

246
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.240
This looks as if it had
been used for a long time.

247
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.120
About 4 years? 5 years?

248
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.500
You're not just using only this one,
are you?

249
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.400
I'll take a look at your
other ones sometime.

250
00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.060
Thank you.

251
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.000
Then, I'd better go.

252
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.400
Wait.

253
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.380
It seems as if it's raining outside.

254
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.240
<i>Sometimes</i>

255
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.340
<i>love will bloom</i>

256
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.240
<i>in the springtime</i>

257
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.480
<i>Then like flowers in summer</i>

258
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.300
<i>it will grow</i>

259
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.020
<i>Then...</i>

260
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.920
Thank you.

261
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.300
Use this when you go.

262
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.300
Thank you.

263
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.560
Go in safely!

264
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:17.020
<i>...evergreen, evergreen</i>

265
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.920
<i>It will last through the summer</i>

266
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.660
<i>and winter, too</i>

267
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.400
Mom.

268
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:02.500
Oh, Son, you're here?

269
00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.500
Mom,
did you just get back from somewhere?

270
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.840
Where would I be coming back from?
I was at work.

271
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.520
Ahh...

272
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.040
Mom,
you seem to be in good spirits today.

273
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.040
Of course.

274
00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.920
I have such a lovely son like you,
so of course, mom is always happy.

275
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.140
Hurry and wash up, then rest.

276
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.920
Okay.

277
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.680
Noona.

278
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.620
I'm in the middle of studying.

279
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.580
I think Mom has a boyfriend.

280
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.140
I don't have time to joke around.

281
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.040
I saw him. In front of the house.

282
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.620
Was he good looking?

283
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.740
Is that what's important?

284
00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.540
Of course.

285
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.000
That's the most important thing.

286
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.600
Doesn't Noona care
if Mom meets another man?

287
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:01.860
Little brother.

288
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.900
A woman is a woman until she dies.

289
00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:05.760
Even Mom?

290
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.760
Mom is mom.

291
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:08.640
Exactly.

292
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.860
After Dad passed away, for ten years,
Mom lived just as mom.

293
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.520
Until Mom says something, let's go
ahead and let her keep it a secret.

294
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.680
But is it for real?

295
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.480
Jung Hye did?

296
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.960
In order to protect her inheritance,
she threatened you?

297
00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.620
That she'll hold hands with
Executive Director Lee?

298
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.800
I told you that she did.

299
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.060
So?

300
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.820
What about what we were proposing?

301
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.880
It was all upended.

302
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.360
If I don't revert the title back to her,

303
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.340
it seemed as if she was going
to immediately give them to him.

304
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.040
This is why I really can't
do anything with you.

305
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.660
Can't you control one wife?

306
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.780
I'm telling you that person
has completely changed.

307
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.140
Oh really.

308
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.640
This is no time to be laughing,
Brother-in-law.

309
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.660
If the shares of Hae Rang stock
that she has is given to Byung Hoo,

310
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.700
then it totally comes under the control of
that bastard and President Kim Jung Yoon.

311
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.460
Strangely, it seems as if it
was after that kid came in,

312
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.260
that she started to change.

313
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.520
Who?

314
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.440
Soo Gyummie?

315
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.420
Oh, this is killing me.

316
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.920
I don't know where or how
to figure this one out.

317
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.780
Anyway, they're a son and a wife,
so I can't just do something to them.

318
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.520
They're in the way,
but you still need them.

319
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.100
That's why it's intolerable.

320
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.500
Get rid of them.

321
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.540
Yes?

322
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.070
It's about time for Father to come home.
Should we scatter?

323
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:46.560
It's okay. He'll probably be late.

324
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.910
Did anything happen to Father?

325
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.090
He's probably off drinking somewhere.
Today...

326
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.090
I took care of him a little.

327
00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.480
By any chance,

328
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.900
did you hit him?

329
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:07.500
I protected my inheritance.

330
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.590
Did you know about it?
I heard you met President Kim Jung Yoon

331
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.360
and asked her to protect my inheritance.

332
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:23.100
I will protect myself.
I don't need the help of that person.

333
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.200
I'm sorry if I hurt...

334
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.110
your feelings.

335
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.410
I'm telling you...

336
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.140
not to be used for my sake.

337
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.450
However, aren't you curious how
I took care of Lee Byung Soo?

338
00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.080
Ah,

339
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.560
how did you do it?

340
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.320
Have you come home?

341
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.250
I'll go upstairs first. Good night.

342
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.250
Yes, go rest.

343
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.050
Get rid of them?

344
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.710
Who?
They are some fools.

345
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.710
Really...

346
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.480
Really...

347
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.340
The two of you must
have a lot of free time?

348
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.830
We were passing by...

349
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.890
I heard you are close to my wife.

350
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.650
That's why they aren't
right for each other.

351
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.260
Eh..

352
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.080
You know what happened to
Principal Hong Sang Man?

353
00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.800
I know. He's completely failed.

354
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.770
Then what are you planning to do to us?

355
00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.300
You are the leader of Avengers Club,
right?

356
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.210
So?

357
00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.080
Shall I tell you what we will do?

358
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.900
Ay,
Hey.

359
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.600
that's where it was.
Some ice in the cooler.

360
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.380
Over there. Please pour some
in over there, over there.

361
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.880
Yes. All.

362
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.600
Don't change the conversation!

363
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.710
Please answer.

364
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.180
Aigoo.

365
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.955
Do? What would we do?
It's just a friendship gathering,

366
00:24:39.155 --> 00:24:41.680
drinking tea and talking about children.

367
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.910
We know it's not just a gathering,
so we are here...

368
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.740
It's 15,000 won.

369
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.280
5,000 won.

370
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.700
Yes?
5,000 won. Please give it to me quickly.

371
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.530
Ah yes. Here it is. Bye!

372
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.040
You seem to have nothing to say.
As you see, I'm working.

373
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.690
Please go. Please go, please go. Go.

374
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.560
Don't look back!

375
00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.120
Leader gave them a punch this morning.

376
00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.230
A widow concept. Completed.

377
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.700
What's this?
My reward has been a little late.

378
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.760
Is this the reward?
Why? Not enough?

379
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.400
I selected all of my favorite ones.

380
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.100
You should have chosen all of my
favorites in order for it to be a reward.

381
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.280
Ah, you're right.

382
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.928
Son, I'm on the way to the
Chairman to report to him

383
00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:39.640
about the tabloid article.
Do you want to come, too?

384
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.040
I'm going ahead.

385
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.520
I came to meet the Chairman.

386
00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.393
You didn't make an
appointment beforehand.

387
00:26:57.593 --> 00:26:59.850
You can't just stubbornly insist
on going in like this.

388
00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.160
What appointment is
needed between family!

389
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.300
Uh, uh, where are you touching! Where?

390
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:12.380
Do you know who I am? I am the Chairman's
daughter-in-law! The first daughter-in-law!

391
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.250
Oh really. Move!
Crazy. Crazy.

392
00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.650
Ah!

393
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.880
Oh, Son, why did you come so late?

394
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.760
Let's go see Grandfather.
Oh, oh. No. Wait.

395
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:30.940
Oh, jagiya! Dad, dad. Dad, dad.

396
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.190
Jagi...

397
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.540
Jagiyah...ah, ah, ah...

398
00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.830
Jagiyah, just wait right
there for a second! Ah, ah.

399
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.080
I'm going crazy. Really.

400
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:46.760
Father.

401
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:48.560
Father,

402
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.460
I don't know how much you saw,
but this is not a situation that I made.

403
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.120
I was attacked unexpectedly, too. Ah!

404
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.120
Stupid bastard.

405
00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.320
Father, I really don't know anything.

406
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.320
Remove her immediately!

407
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.160
I understand, Father. I will.
I'll remove her immediately.

408
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.670
If that woman appears
before my eyes once more,

409
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.080
you will be removed from this company.

410
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.220
Your call is not connected...
Ah, why is she not answering her phone?!

411
00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.810
Why are there no normal women around me!

412
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.396
Ah, Ah. Why are you doing this?
Oh really.

413
00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:42.560
The stairs, the stairs.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

414
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.600
Release me. Release me.
Let me go already! Ah!

415
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.550
I told you if you do it again,
you'll be dead.

416
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.628
You took away all my
money, so it looks as if

417
00:28:49.828 --> 00:28:51.640
I'm going to die anyway.
That's why I came here.

418
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.360
To ask the highest person to save me.

419
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.690
You did? Okay. Let's go. To die.

420
00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:00.280
I won't die. Uh? I won't die.
Uh? Yah, I will not die!

421
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.670
Die? Why would I die?

422
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.670
Taxi! Taxi!

423
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.060
Who are you?! Omo! Omo! Call the police!

424
00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.312
This. Release it,
release, release, release.

425
00:29:24.512 --> 00:29:26.590
Omo, why these? Release it!
You won't release them?

426
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.390
No, no! Why on earth are you doing this?
In someone else's house? Who are you?

427
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.600
Don't touch. Don't touch.

428
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.160
I told them to do it. Why?!

429
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.520
Why are you doing this, huh? Do you know
how much this is? You're really crazy!

430
00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.112
How can I not go crazy because of you?!

431
00:29:43.312 --> 00:29:45.530
Even if you're crazy, you
should be moderately crazy!

432
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.120
Is that all?
There's a car owned by her.

433
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.250
That, you definitely can't have. Because
I was saving that car, I hardly rode it...

434
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.720
Get rid of it and clean here.

435
00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.120
Yes.

436
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.470
No, yeobo! I...

437
00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.290
Whatever you have to do, don't let her
appear in front of my eyes, ok?

438
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.000
Yes.
No. Wait. Let go. Let go. No. You can't.

439
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.790
Stop. Lee Byung Soo!
Hey, you evil bastard!

440
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.910
Let me go. Let me go! Let me go!

441
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:13.230
By 10 o'clock, you'll arrive at Incheon
Port. Take her onboard immediately.

442
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:17.240
I have to take a ship? No. Wait wait!

443
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:23.000
No. Wait wait! Okay! Okay!

444
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.640
Okay, okay, okay!
Hurry and come back.

445
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.400
Ah, I'll go. Ah I see. I'm going.

446
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.460
Aish..

447
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:38.810
Save me! Oh! Save me! Oh!

448
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.530
What? Ran away?

449
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.240
You can't even deal with that
simple thing. Find her right now!

450
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.410
Aish...

451
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.040
You don't need to worry.
I'm getting rid of that woman.

452
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.860
Aish, that woman even came to
the office and made a fuss!

453
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.270
You've suffered too.

454
00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:08.270
But what's this?

455
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.850
Ah, this! Yeobo, it's for you.

456
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.480
Why are you doing this?

457
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.040
I myself went to the flower shop
and chose them to give to you.

458
00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:22.220
Ah, and this too, I myself chose
one which would suit you well.

459
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.650
A scarf.

460
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.160
It's a scarf, right?
I told you I chose it myself.

461
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.500
By chance, is it Mother's birthday today?
No.

462
00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.530
I did something wrong to you,

463
00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.500
and we are people who have to live
together for the rest of our lives.

464
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.165
If there is something to resolve,
then let's resolve it.

465
00:31:47.365 --> 00:31:48.540
And let's receive anything
we should receive. Hmm?

466
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.610
Oh, also you! I said that you should tell me
everything that you want for your birthday!

467
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.250
Whatever you want, just tell me!
Yes.

468
00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.900
I will think about it.
Yes. Don't feel burdened.

469
00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:05.740
Sh..

470
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:13.310
Yes.

471
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.430
Find one where they can
leave within this month.

472
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.430
The faster, the better.

473
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.840
There are three members.
Do you think you're safe?

474
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.800
Avengers Club members are...

475
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.840
Soon, I will take care of them.

476
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.890
What's that?
Mother's knit scarf.

477
00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.770
Mother will like it.

478
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.520
By the way,
please prepare dinner tonight.

479
00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.450
At home? Are guests coming?
Yes. Camp people.

480
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.160
To commemorate the conference,
we wanted to have dinner together.

481
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.570
Yes. I will.

482
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.350
Conference? Camp?

483
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.700
I call for a meeting
of the Avengers Club.

484
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:41.230
So we're going to start the campaign
for rejecting Candidate Baek Young Pyo?

485
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.630
There is only one week
left until the election.

486
00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.590
Yes. Today, they will have a conference
at home, so I will try to find anything.

487
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.710
Yes. Try to listen what they're
talking about, and get any paperwork.

488
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.680
Surely, you'll be able to
find something, right?

489
00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.150
Shall we go together,
saying we will help?

490
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.581
Aigoo. No, you can't.
Other than Soo Gyum,

491
00:34:01.781 --> 00:34:04.570
Avengers Club members
have already been found out.

492
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:10.940
Well, but it's nothing
to be disappointed about.

493
00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:12.700
Oh. Aigoo!

494
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.100
Mother! This.

495
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.000
Knit it again.
You can just knit it again.

496
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.360
You did well! Unknit, unknit.

497
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:26.250
I will hold it for you.
You're doing so well.

498
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.980
It seems the other party was trying
to bring up the election funds issue.

499
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.980
They were? Aish.

500
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.800
By any chance, if they contact Hae Rang,
and things get complicated...

501
00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:48.520
That's nothing to worry about there.
I'm managing Director Lee personally.

502
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:53.080
But since one never knows,
clean up the papers in the office.

503
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.010
Yes, I understand.

504
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.520
Please have some fruit.
Yes.

505
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.440
Yes.

506
00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.010
Thank you.
Yes.

507
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.150
If you want anything more,
please tell me.

508
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.190
I'll eat well, Madam.

509
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.490
Yes.
I'll eat well. I'll eat well.

510
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.844
We're in the middle of
discussing something important.

511
00:35:12.044 --> 00:35:12.410
Yes.

512
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.780
Please talk comfortably.

513
00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:17.840
Have some fruit.

514
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.620
This..

515
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.210
Did everyone leave?

516
00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:58.010
Yes. You've worked hard today.

517
00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:59.520
Yes.

518
00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:12.590
That is... I saw the papers and I was
just about to take a photo with the phone.

519
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:16.200
At that moment, my husband came in,
so I couldn't...

520
00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.340
Ah... ah...

521
00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.780
Then, how about digging into the
other side who gave them the money?

522
00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.229
He was suspicious about
us and even visited you, Unnie.

523
00:36:27.429 --> 00:36:29.560
Why would he answer
that just because I asked?

524
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.930
Right. Right.

525
00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:37.080
Isn't there any evidence?
Didn't you hear anything yesterday?

526
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:41.680
I tried to listen,
but my husband told me to go away.

527
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:46.110
He just told them to clean
up the papers in the office.

528
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.610
Ah!

529
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:50.280
That's it!

530
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:52.970
What?

531
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:54.970
That?

532
00:36:57.784 --> 00:36:58.688
Hello.

533
00:36:59.696 --> 00:37:00.232
Omo!

534
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.192
Omo... Madam.

535
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:02.656
Ah, but,

536
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.176
Candidate Baek and everyone
had scheduled events,

537
00:37:04.184 --> 00:37:05.536
so they have already left.

538
00:37:05.616 --> 00:37:06.664
No, that's okay.

539
00:37:06.864 --> 00:37:09.120
I just came by for a
second to drop this off.

540
00:37:09.136 --> 00:37:10.484
Omo... Thank you.

541
00:37:10.684 --> 00:37:11.832
Please enjoy it.

542
00:37:12.032 --> 00:37:13.416
We'll eat it well.
Yes.

543
00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:32.712
Yes.

544
00:37:34.176 --> 00:37:36.350
The documents you mentioned
have already been taken care of.

545
00:37:39.648 --> 00:37:40.152
Yes.

546
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.152
I understand.

547
00:38:27.792 --> 00:38:28.440
Unnie...

548
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.144
It's in here.

549
00:38:31.344 --> 00:38:33.832
I saw it clearly,
that they were all in here.

550
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.384
So, you're saying...

551
00:38:36.512 --> 00:38:38.405
T-that we just have to put
all these together then, right?

552
00:38:38.605 --> 00:38:38.904
Yes.

553
00:38:40.416 --> 00:38:41.432
We just have to put them together,
right?

554
00:38:41.616 --> 00:38:42.760
Ah, yes. Then...

555
00:38:43.128 --> 00:38:43.960
Let's try it.

556
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.608
This... is for Jung Hye. Here.

557
00:38:46.752 --> 00:38:47.352
Ah...

558
00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:50.072
So this was not the only one...

559
00:38:50.104 --> 00:38:51.088
This here is for Unnie.

560
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.136
Do you think you can do it?

561
00:38:56.976 --> 00:38:59.424
Of course, this much?

562
00:38:59.552 --> 00:39:00.984
It can be done in one night.

563
00:39:01.608 --> 00:39:02.720
Then, Unnie, here.

564
00:39:04.768 --> 00:39:05.424
Ah!

565
00:39:11.408 --> 00:39:12.672
I'll do it at home and bring it back.

566
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.208
Jung Hye...
Jung Hye...

567
00:39:15.408 --> 00:39:16.336
Don't you want to do it together?

568
00:39:17.016 --> 00:39:19.304
If we do it as a group,
it should be faster...

569
00:39:19.888 --> 00:39:20.696
Shall we do that?

570
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.216
Such a son, that I couldn't stop him...

571
00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.252
Because of Madam's interview,

572
00:39:25.452 --> 00:39:26.464
the support has been falling.

573
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:27.784
So, today's speech

574
00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:29.592
must become a definite turning point.

575
00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.392
Yes, it must.

576
00:39:33.992 --> 00:39:35.192
I hope that there will be...

577
00:39:36.024 --> 00:39:38.416
No troubled death like
my son's in this land.

578
00:39:43.072 --> 00:39:44.440
No troubled death...

579
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.744
Like my son's...

580
00:39:57.008 --> 00:39:58.928
Mom, what did you say this is?

581
00:39:59.816 --> 00:40:00.528
It's done.

582
00:40:01.608 --> 00:40:02.896
Mom,
how much did you say it was per sheet?

583
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.096
Let's look at how many you do,

584
00:40:05.656 --> 00:40:06.640
and then I'll calculate
it altogether in full.

585
00:40:07.288 --> 00:40:09.024
There are nothing but numbers here.

586
00:40:09.608 --> 00:40:10.848
What document is this?

587
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.976
To find that out is why
we're here doing this.

588
00:40:13.152 --> 00:40:13.640
Oh.

589
00:40:13.984 --> 00:40:15.080
Mom said she needs it.

590
00:40:16.184 --> 00:40:17.096
Oh, Mom.

591
00:40:17.664 --> 00:40:18.616
Is he handsome?

592
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:21.560
Noona,

593
00:40:22.176 --> 00:40:23.520
you haven't even finished one sheet.

594
00:40:26.592 --> 00:40:27.040
Hm?

595
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.312
Who?

596
00:40:32.168 --> 00:40:33.336
Among the male celebrities,

597
00:40:34.192 --> 00:40:35.248
who do you think is handsome?

598
00:40:37.064 --> 00:40:37.536
Uhm...

599
00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:39.776
Hmm...

600
00:40:42.136 --> 00:40:43.184
No matter how much I think about it,

601
00:40:43.208 --> 00:40:44.928
I don't think there is anyone
as handsome as Hee Soo.

602
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.624
Oh...

603
00:41:03.632 --> 00:41:04.424
Mother-in-Law!

604
00:41:05.864 --> 00:41:06.800
Don't do it anymore.

605
00:41:07.928 --> 00:41:08.864
This isn't fun.

606
00:41:11.592 --> 00:41:12.568
Mother-in-law...

607
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.440
Have you found anything out?

608
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:30.728
How about you, Madam?

609
00:41:31.648 --> 00:41:33.128
My eyes are so sore.

610
00:41:34.504 --> 00:41:35.848
My shoulder feels as if
it's going to fall out.

611
00:41:36.776 --> 00:41:38.560
Do you think the Unnies found something?

612
00:41:38.888 --> 00:41:40.640
If they had,
they would have contacted us by now.

613
00:41:52.112 --> 00:41:54.064
If I could have done this as a job,

614
00:41:54.264 --> 00:41:55.928
I would have earned a lot of money.

615
00:41:57.128 --> 00:41:59.368
Now whenever I even see paper,
I'm dizzy.

616
00:42:00.144 --> 00:42:02.024
If I could have focused
this hard when I'm studying,

617
00:42:02.824 --> 00:42:04.112
I would have gotten into Harvard.

618
00:42:08.728 --> 00:42:10.568
Mi Sook,
but isn't this something you're good at?

619
00:42:10.768 --> 00:42:11.976
Arranging,
and then putting things together?

620
00:42:12.384 --> 00:42:14.528
Ah, I could have finished more,

621
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.544
But Mother-in-law

622
00:42:15.848 --> 00:42:17.256
messed some of them up.

623
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.320
<i>[...Foreign Acc...Contributions...]</i>

624
00:42:49.336 --> 00:42:50.112
These are

625
00:42:50.336 --> 00:42:51.968
really like my babies.

626
00:42:55.296 --> 00:42:56.408
Would it be okay...

627
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.640
If I just put this one
on for the last time?

628
00:43:02.776 --> 00:43:04.304
How much is it for all of these?

629
00:43:04.664 --> 00:43:05.504
Please wait a moment.

630
00:43:16.856 --> 00:43:17.584
Customer...?

631
00:43:24.952 --> 00:43:25.672
Lee Byung Soo

632
00:43:26.864 --> 00:43:28.232
I won't let you get away with this.

633
00:43:34.096 --> 00:43:34.936
Oh...

634
00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.280
Both of you came in
together just in time.

635
00:43:36.696 --> 00:43:37.520
Come have a seat.

636
00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:41.368
I have a big announcement.

637
00:43:41.832 --> 00:43:42.472
What is it?

638
00:43:42.696 --> 00:43:43.752
Let's talk about it sitting down.

639
00:43:51.976 --> 00:43:52.720
Well, here.

640
00:44:02.544 --> 00:44:03.456
What is this?

641
00:44:04.784 --> 00:44:06.020
They say that now is the
best time to go there.

642
00:44:06.296 --> 00:44:07.984
You have to study
management courses anyway.

643
00:44:08.368 --> 00:44:09.528
It's good to begin your
studies at a university.

644
00:44:10.712 --> 00:44:11.352
What are you doing?

645
00:44:11.544 --> 00:44:12.304
Ah, you.

646
00:44:13.712 --> 00:44:15.200
Pick one that you like.

647
00:44:15.952 --> 00:44:16.304
Here.

648
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.760
What are you trying to do?

649
00:44:19.984 --> 00:44:21.728
How could we let a child
go over there alone,

650
00:44:22.024 --> 00:44:24.312
when he has a good mother
like you to support him?

651
00:44:24.896 --> 00:44:26.952
Besides, you are restless living here.

652
00:44:27.176 --> 00:44:27.872
Father!

653
00:44:27.984 --> 00:44:29.096
Ah, no need to hurry things.

654
00:44:29.784 --> 00:44:31.288
You can choose a university
once you're there.

655
00:44:31.856 --> 00:44:33.752
They've all been selected
after much consideration.

656
00:44:33.872 --> 00:44:35.168
So take your time looking at them.

657
00:44:36.544 --> 00:44:39.200
How can Father make decisions by
yourself about a matter like this?

658
00:44:40.376 --> 00:44:41.776
Since you have entered this family,

659
00:44:41.976 --> 00:44:43.816
this is a stage that
you must go through.

660
00:44:45.184 --> 00:44:46.544
I have no thought of doing that.

661
00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.336
I won't go.

662
00:44:49.936 --> 00:44:51.160
I haven't asked for your opinion.

663
00:44:52.304 --> 00:44:52.848
Right now,

664
00:44:53.096 --> 00:44:55.656
you only have to choose which
university you want to attend.

665
00:44:56.032 --> 00:44:56.664
Stop doing this.

666
00:44:57.408 --> 00:44:58.944
You know you're being unreasonable,
don't you?

667
00:45:01.624 --> 00:45:03.440
Do you think I doing
this because I'm bored?

668
00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:05.352
This matter has already been settled.

669
00:45:06.576 --> 00:45:07.624
What are you saying?

670
00:45:09.152 --> 00:45:10.968
I have already gotten
permission from Father-in-Law

671
00:45:11.248 --> 00:45:12.576
to send the two of you abroad.

672
00:45:13.512 --> 00:45:14.744
Why are you deciding

673
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.912
where I should live?

674
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.808
Since it's already been decided,

675
00:45:18.424 --> 00:45:19.528
go in good spirits.

676
00:45:31.976 --> 00:45:33.200
"Father-in-law's permission,"

677
00:45:33.352 --> 00:45:34.144
what does that mean?

678
00:45:34.208 --> 00:45:35.040
Ay.. I...

679
00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:37.208
I wasn't going to say this.

680
00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:39.200
I am...

681
00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.896
making a lot of effort to
protect you and Soo Gyum.

682
00:45:44.216 --> 00:45:44.848
Protect?

683
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:45.944
You and him, don't you know

684
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.184
there are strange rumors going around?

685
00:45:48.616 --> 00:45:51.056
Those have reached Father-in-law's ear,

686
00:45:51.744 --> 00:45:53.176
and he's very worried

687
00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.020
about the impact on the company.

688
00:45:55.536 --> 00:45:57.160
He has told me several times

689
00:45:57.968 --> 00:45:59.512
to make sure that it doesn't
affect Geon Ah Group.

690
00:46:00.728 --> 00:46:02.360
I will talk to Father
about this by myself.

691
00:46:04.984 --> 00:46:06.744
Don't make several people feel tired,

692
00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.544
and just do as you're told.

693
00:46:09.648 --> 00:46:10.848
Since there is no one

694
00:46:11.024 --> 00:46:13.184
who welcomes you and that kid.

695
00:46:16.488 --> 00:46:17.144
You.

696
00:46:18.296 --> 00:46:19.176
I won't let you get away with this.

697
00:46:57.528 --> 00:46:59.552
I've already finished the school
transfer procedure in advance,

698
00:46:59.656 --> 00:47:00.416
so just know that.

699
00:47:00.536 --> 00:47:02.496
I've definitely told
you that I'm not going.

700
00:47:02.568 --> 00:47:04.880
Although his enrollment has already been
arranged, you'd better double check it.

701
00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:06.088
I will get people to help you.

702
00:47:07.544 --> 00:47:08.960
Why don't you moderate
your fake helpfulness?

703
00:47:10.312 --> 00:47:11.176
Ah... Also,

704
00:47:11.848 --> 00:47:12.896
before you two leave,

705
00:47:13.648 --> 00:47:14.592
get some tutoring in English.

706
00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.656
Don't worry.

707
00:47:44.272 --> 00:47:45.584
If you don't want to,
then you're not going.

708
00:47:47.776 --> 00:47:48.456
Same with Madam.

709
00:47:49.808 --> 00:47:50.840
If Madam don't want to,

710
00:47:51.056 --> 00:47:51.680
then it won't happen.

711
00:47:53.392 --> 00:47:55.360
I'm not going to let those
people make decisions for me.

712
00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.160
Did you make a decision yet?

713
00:48:04.192 --> 00:48:05.200
I've said this before,

714
00:48:06.184 --> 00:48:07.280
that Madam should just
think of yourself.

715
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.536
No matter what kind
of decision you make,

716
00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:12.088
it's okay with me.

717
00:48:26.752 --> 00:48:28.680
Why are you living with Father?

718
00:48:30.512 --> 00:48:32.256
Is it a case of the ideal
being separate from reality?

719
00:48:35.384 --> 00:48:36.544
The only thing I can do

720
00:48:36.928 --> 00:48:38.568
is live as that person's wife.

721
00:48:38.808 --> 00:48:39.664
Who said so?

722
00:48:41.512 --> 00:48:42.696
Who told you to live like this?

723
00:48:43.272 --> 00:48:45.392
Put aside your family,
relations, others' opinions.

724
00:48:45.784 --> 00:48:46.392
How about you?

725
00:48:48.504 --> 00:48:50.416
What do you want to do?

726
00:49:26.088 --> 00:49:27.856
You're going to have to
find a person for me.

727
00:49:34.576 --> 00:49:35.400
I have decided.

728
00:49:36.208 --> 00:49:37.472
Going forward,

729
00:49:38.064 --> 00:49:38.936
I will decide on how I should live.

730
00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:40.552
You've made a good decision.

731
00:49:59.096 --> 00:49:59.896
This is unusual.

732
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.032
This is the first time that
you wanted to see me first.

733
00:50:03.704 --> 00:50:04.264
Grandfather.

734
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.200
My "ankle."

735
00:50:07.176 --> 00:50:08.080
I will let you "grab" it.

736
00:50:09.608 --> 00:50:10.048
What?

737
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.760
It looks as if you have a request.

738
00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:13.384
Yes.

739
00:50:15.104 --> 00:50:16.520
Let me hear it anyway.

740
00:50:16.632 --> 00:50:17.312
Please let go

741
00:50:18.056 --> 00:50:18.728
of Madam.

742
00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:22.344
I will let you "grab my ankle."

743
00:50:22.928 --> 00:50:23.312
But instead,

744
00:50:25.016 --> 00:50:26.024
please let Madam go.

745
00:50:28.584 --> 00:50:30.336
What is the reason you want to do this?

746
00:50:30.536 --> 00:50:31.784
Father is planning on sending

747
00:50:33.184 --> 00:50:34.632
Madam and me out of country by force.

748
00:50:35.296 --> 00:50:35.760
What?!

749
00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.112
I don't want Father

750
00:50:37.736 --> 00:50:39.752
to order me and Madam around anymore.

751
00:50:40.328 --> 00:50:41.136
I would like Grandfather

752
00:50:42.104 --> 00:50:43.456
to take care of this situation.

753
00:50:44.024 --> 00:50:44.576
You said...

754
00:50:46.416 --> 00:50:47.984
That a family member is a person
who becomes someone you need.

755
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.224
Right now,

756
00:50:49.904 --> 00:50:50.888
I need you, Grandfather.

757
00:51:07.656 --> 00:51:08.728
Oh...

758
00:51:09.576 --> 00:51:11.256
How did you know I'm not in a good mood?

759
00:51:13.504 --> 00:51:14.656
Just cook some ramen for me then.

760
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.208
If you maintain a good
relationship with Senator Choi,

761
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.800
it will help your term
of service go smoothly.

762
00:51:21.192 --> 00:51:23.064
And reappointment will
also come naturally.

763
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:24.960
Thanks for your hard work.

764
00:51:29.752 --> 00:51:30.224
Hello. What is it?

765
00:51:31.224 --> 00:51:34.336
Yeobo, Mother-in-law's
illness suddenly relapsed,

766
00:51:34.696 --> 00:51:36.096
so you should also go
to the hospital quickly.

767
00:51:39.656 --> 00:51:40.696
This also happened a little while ago.

768
00:51:41.688 --> 00:51:43.464
It's not the first time,
so why are you overreacting so much?

769
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.624
I have an important schedule to
attend to now, so I can't go.

770
00:51:47.792 --> 00:51:48.112
Hang up.

771
00:51:58.808 --> 00:52:00.088
Why do you keep calling me?

772
00:52:00.576 --> 00:52:02.416
Mother has just entered
the Intensive Care Unit!

773
00:52:02.616 --> 00:52:03.888
Come to the hospital immediately!

774
00:52:04.728 --> 00:52:05.584
Is she in a critical condition?

775
00:52:05.904 --> 00:52:07.060
She's regained her consciousness,

776
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.416
but her breathing is not stable.

777
00:52:08.712 --> 00:52:09.856
Aigoo, Senator Choi!

778
00:52:34.232 --> 00:52:35.008
Mother-in-law!

779
00:52:36.824 --> 00:52:37.880
She's alright, isn't she?

780
00:52:37.944 --> 00:52:39.448
This is already the third time.

781
00:52:39.464 --> 00:52:41.712
One more time of septic shock
could be very dangerous.

782
00:52:43.688 --> 00:52:44.848
Is there any other method?

783
00:52:44.928 --> 00:52:47.184
The medicine she's using now is
not effective anymore either.

784
00:52:47.424 --> 00:52:48.728
And she is elderly.

785
00:52:48.976 --> 00:52:51.096
Trying to prevent her illness from
getting worse is the best method now.

786
00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:54.944
What should I do?

787
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.780
Ma'am, I'm going home quickly
for a change of clothes.

788
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.660
Can you please take care of
my mother in the meantime?

789
00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:02.460
Yes.

790
00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.630
They say the crisis has passed,
so go ahead, run home and be back.

791
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:07.630
Yes. Then.

792
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.930
Do you have something worrying you, too?

793
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.060
Hyung, too?

794
00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.400
You go first.

795
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:14.230
The thing is it's not certain yet.

796
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.600
I don't have anything
that's certain either.

797
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.030
I saw my mother getting
out of some guy's car.

798
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.200
Not a taxi?

799
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.030
No. It was a really awesome car.

800
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.960
The driver was pretty cool-looking, too.

801
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:40.000
So did you dislike seeing them together?

802
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:44.900
Since I felt bad that my
mom was living only for us,

803
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.800
I thought it would be nice
if my mom met someone nice.

804
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:51.530
But I guess, that wasn't really true.

805
00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:58.660
I worry what I would say if my mom
told us she had really met someone.

806
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.560
I don't know what to say

807
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.860
so I can't even ask her about it.

808
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.960
But you know,

809
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:11.700
your mom could just have gotten a ride.

810
00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:14.960
Hyung, it's because you didn't see
the expression on my mom's face.

811
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:20.030
That was the first time I ever
saw my mom laughing like that.

812
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.000
So what?

813
00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.560
Your mom always laughs.

814
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.630
It's different.

815
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.760
That's hard.

816
00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.030
What about hyung? What's worrying you?

817
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.930
Mine is a little bit harder.

818
00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.300
Save me! I'll repay you! One more time!

819
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.300
Han Soo Ji?

820
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.587
I'm not in a position to
just hang out with you

821
00:57:26.787 --> 00:57:29.400
like this as if we have
all the time in the world.

822
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.430
I know.

823
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.900
I know that Lee Byung
Soo is forcing you out.

824
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.430
Did you order him to do that?

825
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.430
I have a favor to ask.

826
00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:43.960
Do I look like I'm in a position
to listen to your requests?

827
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.030
What favor did you want from me?

828
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:56.930
Do an interview.

829
00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.030
Interview?

830
00:57:58.230 --> 00:58:01.930
An interview about Hae Rang Construction's
Lee Byung Soo's mistress, Han Soo Ji.

831
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.860
Will you do it or not?

832
00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:08.360
Yes. I'll do it. Let's do it.

833
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.460
When should I do it?

834
00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:11.500
One more thing.

835
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.430
Come on,
why do you have so many conditions?

836
00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:18.560
Don't appear in front
of Soo Gyum ever again.

837
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.560
Uh, okay.

838
00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.830
Okay. Okay.

839
00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:40.860
Since I have an
interview to prepare for,

840
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:44.500
I need to do my hair so
I'm going to leave first.

841
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.530
Right now I'm on my
way to see Han Soo Ji.

842
00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.700
Yes.

843
00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:01.060
If you give her that, she will
definitely say that she will do it.

844
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.430
Even now, if you don't want me to...

845
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:03.430
No.

846
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:06.330
Please make sure you do it for me.

847
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:08.965
But they are your birth parents.

848
00:59:09.165 --> 00:59:11.600
You know the situation well.

849
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.630
That those people

850
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.060
are worse to me than strangers.

851
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:39.900
Seo Yeon?

852
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.760
Ahh...

853
00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.760
Just...

854
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.339
Your grandmother suddenly
took a turn for the worse,

855
00:59:46.539 --> 00:59:48.060
so I have to go
back to the hospital.

856
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:52.500
Her condition is stable, so tomorrow you
and I will visit your grandmother together.

857
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:53.930
Okay.

858
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.162
Lastly from here,
regarding the death of my son,

859
01:00:18.362 --> 01:00:21.760
that I wasn't honest about the situation.

860
01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:25.260
I would like to get forgiveness
from everyone in the country.

861
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:26.560
My son

862
01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.763
insisted that the school
system here in Korea

863
01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:32.830
wouldn't allow him
to realize his dreams,

864
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.630
and chose to go abroad for school.

865
01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.860
That I wasn't able to stop
my son from that decision

866
01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.400
was because

867
01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:45.660
I acknowledged that this country's
education system had issues.

868
01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.700
That's all lies.

869
01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.100
So that in this land of ours,

870
01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:58.200
that more miserable deaths like
my son's won't occur again,

871
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.065
I am in this position
despite being embarrassed.

872
01:01:01.265 --> 01:01:03.962
For over 20 years having
served as a professor,

873
01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:06.860
now as the Superintendent
of Schools for Seoul,

874
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.960
I want to finally realize
the long developed plans.

875
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:25.860
You said Oppa wanted to go abroad.

876
01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.460
Seo Yeon, go to your room.

877
01:01:32.330 --> 01:01:36.730
He failed science, so you told him you
were ashamed and he had to go abroad.

878
01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.980
Oppa said so much that
he didn't want to go!

879
01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.230
He said he was afraid,
but you forced him to go!

880
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:42.860
Yah, Baek Seo Yeon!

881
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:46.400
What do you think you know that you
can speak so rudely to me like this?!

882
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.560
Why?!

883
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.200
You're going to hit me, too?!

884
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.330
I wish I were dead, too!

885
01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:52.230
Brat.

886
01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:59.230
How dare you raise your hand to her?

887
01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:01.830
You.

888
01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.900
You,

889
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.760
you're finished!

890
01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:19.100
Here it is.

891
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:22.560
Knife.

892
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I will take my hands off your property.

893
01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:40.960
We're members of the Avengers Club. Why?

894
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.660
Slapping the backs of the husbands'
heads, that is a parents group?

895
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.860
You're the leader of the Avengers Club,
right?

896
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.960
The first daughter-in-law!
Crazy. Crazy.

897
01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:54.360
Ahhh!

898
01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.630
This is yours.

899
01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:05.400
Do an interview.
Okay.

900
01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.330
Don't appear in front
of Soo Gyum ever again.

901
01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.160
How dare you raise your hand to her?

902
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.530
For everyone's sake,

903
01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:19.360
don't be bothersome,
just do as you're told.

904
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.560
I'm not going to leave you be.

905
01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.800
