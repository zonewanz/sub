<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:19.635
It's my daughter...

4
00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:27.279
<i>If I believe in fate...</i>

5
00:00:29.317 --> 00:00:32.751
<i>If we meet again, as if it were fate...</i>

6
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:34.724
<i>then I will really...</i>

7
00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:46.979
<i>[I love you.]</i>

8
00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.754
This was the place that I hated
the most in the package itinerary.

9
00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:55.230
But I think I'll feel more
comfortable about it now.

10
00:00:56.063 --> 00:00:58.673
Thank you for driving all this way.

11
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.598
What are you going to do tomorrow?

12
00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:06.522
I'll do some laundry, and get
ready to welcome the next group.

13
00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:10.001
Have you ever traveled in France?

14
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:13.359
I'm a guide. Traveling is my job.

15
00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.171
Not like that. A real vacation.

16
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:20.800
As a drifter.
A vacation as a true traveler.

17
00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:24.288
Go on a vacation.

18
00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:27.591
Put down the flag, and travel freely.

19
00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:30.933
I don't have time for that.

20
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:33.626
There's a lineup of package
vacation travelers

21
00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.410
and I have to study in my free time.

22
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.668
I don't need to travel.
I just want to do nothing.

23
00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:44.340
I want to read, take naps,
and dream all day long.

24
00:01:44.912 --> 00:01:47.177
That's a vacation too.

25
00:01:47.177 --> 00:01:49.481
I can't afford to do that.

26
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.318
You're going straight to work, right?

27
00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:54.138
Will you be okay?

28
00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.752
I don't think so.

29
00:01:57.752 --> 00:01:59.501
I'm back!

30
00:02:03.537 --> 00:02:06.511
<i>It's a question of
who will pull the trigger first.</i>

31
00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:12.361
<i>Are you going to get fired?</i>

32
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:17.389
They can't do that. The company
made a huge mistake.

33
00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:22.333
Isn't it more about who has more
power rather than who made the mistake?

34
00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:26.756
That's true, but there are loyal
people who have a conscience

35
00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:31.077
so it's okay. I can live
as long as that exists.

36
00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:51.154
I asked to come here just to tell you
I wanted to break up and sever contact.

37
00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:53.137
You must feel sad.

38
00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:57.018
No, there's nothing to be sad about.

39
00:02:57.018 --> 00:02:58.601
I'm not sad at all.

40
00:03:00.017 --> 00:03:01.776
<i>Jerk.</i>

41
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.697
We're going to meet again anyway.

42
00:03:06.697 --> 00:03:10.362
You said that's our fate.

43
00:03:10.362 --> 00:03:12.293
<i>He's a good person.</i>

44
00:03:45.306 --> 00:03:49.001
<i>[Mi Jung]</i>

45
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.659
Fine! I won't get married! I won't
make you suffer so I can be happy!

46
00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.947
I won't get married, okay?

47
00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:10.287
<i>The number can't be reached...</i>

48
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.604
<i>I'm sorry. I don't think
we can get married.</i>

49
00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:36.341
<i>You wouldn't pick up all day.</i>

50
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:39.307
<i>You turned out well in the video.</i>

51
00:04:39.307 --> 00:04:42.712
<i>I think we can let our daughter
become a movie director.</i>

52
00:04:50.197 --> 00:04:52.236
<i>Cut! Again!</i>

53
00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.178
<i>Thank you for accepting my dad.</i>

54
00:05:21.892 --> 00:05:23.930
<i>A man who can't do anything right.</i>

55
00:05:24.678 --> 00:05:26.625
<i>However...</i>

56
00:05:28.517 --> 00:05:29.878
<i>I love you.</i>

57
00:05:33.005 --> 00:05:36.829
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

58
00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:38.618
<i>I love you.</i>

59
00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:40.920
<i>I love you.</i>

60
00:05:45.663 --> 00:05:48.026
<i>I'll call you "Mom" one day.</i>

61
00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:52.317
<i>Please wait, even if it takes a while.</i>

62
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.310
I resent you so much.

63
00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:10.971
Really.

64
00:06:32.194 --> 00:06:35.019
You were well behaved
for the last few days.

65
00:06:41.212 --> 00:06:42.944
It's my daughter.

66
00:06:45.387 --> 00:06:47.694
You have to pay a fine
of 50,000 won if you get drunk.

67
00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:53.310
Wasn't it 30,000 won?

68
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.411
I guess your mind is clear. Get in here!

69
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:57.610
Hurry.

70
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.399
Geez, my neck almost broke.

71
00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.550
Use the pillow.

72
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.194
Na Hyun.

73
00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:11.385
Back in my day,
if you didn't go to college

74
00:07:11.385 --> 00:07:16.360
and didn't have a proper job,
people treated you like crap.

75
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.724
Aren't you going to brush your teeth?

76
00:07:18.724 --> 00:07:22.041
But that's how it is these days too.

77
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:25.551
- Do you want your toothbrush?
- I'm sorry.

78
00:07:26.894 --> 00:07:30.315
I should have made
this world into a place

79
00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:35.255
where people don't discriminate
based on expulsion or occupation.

80
00:07:35.798 --> 00:07:38.286
I'm sorry, Na Hyun.

81
00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.894
It's not like you have
that kind of power.

82
00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:43.404
I want you to do that.

83
00:07:44.094 --> 00:07:49.582
Live a fun and cool life,
without going to college.

84
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.466
And don't get looked down on
because you didn't go to college.

85
00:07:55.182 --> 00:07:57.507
Prove them wrong.

86
00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:08.017
I told you to brush your teeth first.

87
00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:26.906
What are you doing here?

88
00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:32.674
What is this?
How did you know I was here?

89
00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:36.156
I didn't know.
This is the way to our hotel.

90
00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:38.422
Were you looking for me?

91
00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:40.780
No.

92
00:08:45.363 --> 00:08:47.224
What's wrong?

93
00:08:48.358 --> 00:08:50.563
Do you want to hear something funny?

94
00:08:53.814 --> 00:08:55.643
I came to hang this up.

95
00:08:56.421 --> 00:08:58.749
But we're not allowed anymore.

96
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:05.042
All those locks broke the fence,
so they tore it down.

97
00:09:05.042 --> 00:09:08.916
That's okay. That lock
doesn't have any meaning.

98
00:09:08.916 --> 00:09:11.420
Why doesn't anything work out for me?

99
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.513
Aren't I allowed to have some hope?

100
00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:21.619
I was going to ride that ship.

101
00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:26.177
If you keep standing
and feel the wind on your face

102
00:09:26.177 --> 00:09:29.638
you feel like a model or a female lead.

103
00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:33.551
But apparently, it's really cold.

104
00:09:35.195 --> 00:09:40.224
Maybe hope... is something like that.

105
00:09:40.868 --> 00:09:44.554
You wait for it without
knowing what it really is

106
00:09:44.554 --> 00:09:47.358
while you're miserable in the present.

107
00:09:49.295 --> 00:09:51.265
Just like us.

108
00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:53.613
I know, right?

109
00:09:54.374 --> 00:09:57.302
Today is an important day for us.

110
00:09:58.041 --> 00:09:59.842
It's been seven years since we met.

111
00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:02.208
We couldn't blow out the candles either.

112
00:10:03.638 --> 00:10:05.954
I was going to propose to you today.

113
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:10.946
I was going to tell you that we can get
married because I got the investment.

114
00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:13.438
That I'd make you happy forever.

115
00:10:14.148 --> 00:10:18.313
I was going to hang up the lock,
give you the ring

116
00:10:18.313 --> 00:10:20.152
and sing you a song.

117
00:10:25.613 --> 00:10:28.244
But I can't do anything for you anymore.

118
00:10:28.244 --> 00:10:30.392
That's not important in our relationship.

119
00:10:30.392 --> 00:10:33.396
It wasn't important to us,
but it was important to me.

120
00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:38.218
I didn't want you to feel inferior
when you introduced me as your husband.

121
00:10:38.218 --> 00:10:40.570
I wanted to feel that.

122
00:10:42.169 --> 00:10:48.042
I... just want to love.
I don't want to brag about it.

123
00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:50.633
I thought about it all wrong.

124
00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:54.440
There's no connection between
marriage and the investment.

125
00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:57.009
Damn it.

126
00:10:57.945 --> 00:10:59.873
I won't think that way anymore.

127
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:05.973
Marriage isn't our goal, and the baby
we'll have isn't our goal either.

128
00:11:05.973 --> 00:11:09.651
I won't live just for the baby
if we have one.

129
00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:11.276
I'm just going to love you.

130
00:11:13.978 --> 00:11:16.166
Forever, without a reason.

131
00:11:34.323 --> 00:11:36.993
- It's cold, isn't it?
- Yeah.

132
00:11:36.993 --> 00:11:40.232
You bought a ring, huh? Let me see it.

133
00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:41.661
I'll put it on for you.

134
00:11:41.661 --> 00:11:44.075
Are you crazy? This looks expensive!

135
00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:46.283
I thought my investment
would come through.

136
00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:48.182
Get a hold of yourself.

137
00:11:48.182 --> 00:11:51.300
- I'll return it.
- Forget it.

138
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.400
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. I need to poop.

139
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.478
Hey!

140
00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:04.276
Did you sleep well last night?

141
00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:05.849
- Yes!
- Yes!

142
00:12:05.849 --> 00:12:08.959
How could you do that? You're smiling
just before you have to leave.

143
00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:10.824
We always answered you, didn't we?

144
00:12:10.824 --> 00:12:12.733
You didn't.

145
00:12:13.472 --> 00:12:16.895
But this group was
my favorite group thus far.

146
00:12:16.895 --> 00:12:21.283
You caused the fewest accidents and
listened to my instructions very well.

147
00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:23.542
Although there were some exceptions.

148
00:12:24.336 --> 00:12:26.897
There's one more activity
before we head to the airport.

149
00:12:26.897 --> 00:12:30.193
What's the one thing we haven't
done since we came to France?

150
00:12:30.193 --> 00:12:32.522
- Shopping!
- You did that.

151
00:12:32.522 --> 00:12:34.805
Shopping! That's correct!

152
00:12:34.805 --> 00:12:38.785
You can't leave out group shopping
on a package vacation.

153
00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:41.910
I thought long and hard
before I chose one place.

154
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.844
Just remember these two things.

155
00:12:43.844 --> 00:12:46.113
First, tax refund.

156
00:12:46.113 --> 00:12:51.329
There are employees who can speak
Korean, so they'll explain it to you.

157
00:12:51.329 --> 00:12:53.844
And second, free samples.

158
00:12:53.844 --> 00:12:57.463
Just take all the free samples
they give you.

159
00:12:57.463 --> 00:13:02.263
They're perfect travel size products for
your next vacation. You have two hours!

160
00:13:02.263 --> 00:13:03.983
Where is it?

161
00:13:16.482 --> 00:13:18.227
- Pick one.
- Huh?

162
00:13:18.227 --> 00:13:20.954
- Pick one.
- How?

163
00:13:22.458 --> 00:13:24.108
Just pick one.

164
00:13:24.108 --> 00:13:25.811
I can't.

165
00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:29.945
- Did you buy anything?
- Just a hand cream for my mom.

166
00:13:29.945 --> 00:13:33.228
- Would you like help checking out?
- That's okay.

167
00:13:33.797 --> 00:13:35.578
This is all I need.

168
00:13:38.323 --> 00:13:40.871
Wow, this is France.

169
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:43.762
It's raining all of a sudden.

170
00:13:43.762 --> 00:13:46.868
What will we do for two hours?
It's only been 15 minutes.

171
00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:50.353
- I know, right?
- Do you think we'll use the time?

172
00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:54.237
I don't know about anyone else,
but my girlfriend will.

173
00:13:54.237 --> 00:13:57.759
I like people like you, Head Chief Jung.
You only took five minutes.

174
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:01.223
- What's your secret?
- "Avatar" shopping.

175
00:14:01.223 --> 00:14:03.296
I never exceed the three steps.

176
00:14:03.296 --> 00:14:05.448
<i>First, I receive the order.</i>

177
00:14:05.448 --> 00:14:07.676
<i>Second, I show it to the employee.</i>

178
00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:10.446
<i>Third, I buy it.</i>

179
00:14:10.446 --> 00:14:12.974
- Done.
- Wow.

180
00:14:12.974 --> 00:14:15.528
- Wow.
- Wow.

181
00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:18.761
- Are you done?
- Are you done shopping?

182
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:21.184
I didn't have anything to buy.

183
00:14:21.184 --> 00:14:23.847
I can't even use up what I have already.

184
00:14:23.847 --> 00:14:25.405
What about your husband?

185
00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:27.600
My skin tone... You scared me!

186
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.340
You scared me more.

187
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.224
Big Sis, pick out
a cosmetic product for me.

188
00:14:34.224 --> 00:14:36.776
I don't know much about men's products.

189
00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:39.852
- You think...
- Please help me out.

190
00:14:39.852 --> 00:14:42.734
I don't know what to buy for my wife.

191
00:14:42.734 --> 00:14:46.324
- Why doesn't she pick it out?
- She said it's a waste of money.

192
00:14:46.978 --> 00:14:49.377
What does she normally use?

193
00:14:49.377 --> 00:14:52.508
- Cosmetic products. What else?
- That's not what I mean.

194
00:14:52.508 --> 00:14:55.813
- Is she dry?
- Yeah, she's the casual type.

195
00:14:55.813 --> 00:14:57.632
But she's meticulous
when she needs to be.

196
00:14:57.632 --> 00:15:00.460
I'm not talking about her
personality. Her skin type.

197
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.711
Her skin? What about it?

198
00:15:02.711 --> 00:15:05.677
Gosh, you're too much, Mister.

199
00:15:05.677 --> 00:15:09.961
The thing is... she's never used
good cosmetic products before.

200
00:15:09.961 --> 00:15:11.626
I don't care about the price.

201
00:15:11.626 --> 00:15:14.786
Just pick out the best one for her, okay?

202
00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:18.917
Okay, follow me.

203
00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:20.357
Wait.

204
00:15:20.357 --> 00:15:21.903
Wait.

205
00:15:27.612 --> 00:15:30.647
This is Arc de Triomphe de I'Étoile.

206
00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:37.022
Below the arc, you can find the grave of
an unknown soldier who died in WWI.

207
00:15:37.766 --> 00:15:43.576
Ever since this grave was made,
the fire has never gone out.

208
00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:46.830
And the flowers have never died.

209
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:53.651
In France, I strongly feel that French
people work hard to remember history.

210
00:15:54.738 --> 00:15:58.287
If we forget because it has
nothing to do with us

211
00:15:58.287 --> 00:16:03.214
we'll be victims one day,
and they know that very well.

212
00:16:03.214 --> 00:16:05.762
I want to say one more thing.

213
00:16:05.762 --> 00:16:09.926
People go on vacations to become happy.

214
00:16:09.926 --> 00:16:15.675
Please don't forget that the world
becomes happier the happier you become.

215
00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:24.118
But there are a few types
of people you mustn't travel with.

216
00:16:24.118 --> 00:16:26.011
First, the lazy type.

217
00:16:26.011 --> 00:16:32.065
If you travel with them, you have to
plan out the trip all my yourself.

218
00:16:32.065 --> 00:16:35.597
But these people also complain a lot.

219
00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:40.647
"This hostel sucks. This food
sucks." It's really annoying.

220
00:16:40.647 --> 00:16:43.988
- What should they do?
- They can go on a package vacation.

221
00:16:44.608 --> 00:16:47.454
That's right! You get a prize.

222
00:16:47.454 --> 00:16:49.102
There's a prize?

223
00:16:49.102 --> 00:16:51.850
This is a delicious wine
that's hard to find in Korea.

224
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.156
Wow!

225
00:16:56.916 --> 00:17:01.281
Second, the dictator type.
"Trust me. I'll do everything."

226
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:03.886
They plan out the whole trip
and all the food choices

227
00:17:03.886 --> 00:17:06.280
but it's impossible to like all of it.

228
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.250
If you complain, they'll get mad.
What should they do?

229
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.485
I know! They can go
on a package vacation.

230
00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:15.424
That's right! You get a prize!

231
00:17:15.948 --> 00:17:17.793
This is too hard!

232
00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:23.311
Third, the unprepared type.
They didn't bring any cosmetics

233
00:17:23.311 --> 00:17:24.718
so they ask to borrow yours.

234
00:17:24.718 --> 00:17:27.338
- I know! A package vacation!
- That's right!

235
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:30.747
Don't run!

236
00:17:30.747 --> 00:17:32.592
- Next...
- Thank you.

237
00:17:32.592 --> 00:17:36.732
I'll let San Ma Ru
answer the last question.

238
00:17:36.732 --> 00:17:39.876
You really don't want to
travel with this type.

239
00:17:39.876 --> 00:17:43.921
"You worked hard. Thank you.
I'm sorry. I love you."

240
00:17:43.921 --> 00:17:48.407
There are people who don't express
their feelings. What should they do?

241
00:17:50.613 --> 00:17:53.494
- Go on a package vacation?
- That's right.

242
00:17:53.494 --> 00:17:55.290
How is that right?

243
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.970
The guide will express it for them.

244
00:17:58.555 --> 00:18:01.832
Everyone, you worked hard
on this long vacation.

245
00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:06.071
I'm very thankful, sorry

246
00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:09.460
and... I love you all.

247
00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:25.633
You can get on now.

248
00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:27.430
It'll be crowded
because it's the weekend.

249
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.971
Please hurry.

250
00:18:36.401 --> 00:18:39.680
Remember to eat your meals. Stay healthy.

251
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.428
And thank you.

252
00:18:43.335 --> 00:18:45.591
Visit us in Korea.

253
00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:48.419
I will, Mother. Please stay healthy.

254
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.161
You worked hard, Big Sis Guide.

255
00:18:53.161 --> 00:18:56.054
It must have been hard
eating food you didn't like.

256
00:18:58.322 --> 00:19:01.932
- Buy yourself a nice meal.
- Thank you.

257
00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:04.780
Call me when you come to Korea.
Buy me a delicious meal.

258
00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.066
I will.

259
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:10.241
I'll come back with my friends.

260
00:19:10.241 --> 00:19:11.784
Please do that.

261
00:19:14.061 --> 00:19:15.573
Thank you.

262
00:19:17.087 --> 00:19:19.937
I didn't buy that dress.
Can you help me buy it?

263
00:19:19.937 --> 00:19:22.331
Of course. Just give me a call.

264
00:19:22.331 --> 00:19:23.869
Thank you.

265
00:19:34.113 --> 00:19:37.694
Please give me a guide rating
of 10 out of 10.

266
00:19:38.487 --> 00:19:39.998
I will.

267
00:19:46.578 --> 00:19:48.575
Please go inside!

268
00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:56.294
Goodbye!

269
00:19:57.776 --> 00:19:59.734
- Bye!
- Have a safe trip!

270
00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:02.747
You're the best. Take care of yourself.

271
00:20:02.747 --> 00:20:04.703
Please stay healthy, Mother!

272
00:20:08.546 --> 00:20:11.844
I'll miss you! I'll see you again!

273
00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:18.346
Have a safe trip.

274
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.615
<i>Are you safely on your way?</i>

275
00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:34.005
<i>How far along are you?</i>

276
00:21:38.357 --> 00:21:42.413
<i>[Arrivals]</i>

277
00:21:43.125 --> 00:21:45.238
<i>We arrived safely.</i>

278
00:21:49.257 --> 00:21:51.745
<i>I arrived safely too,
without any problems.</i>

279
00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:59.952
You should have known better.
What is this?

280
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:04.571
I'm not into this stuff.
My friend asked for this.

281
00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:08.526
He's lonely, you see. I'm sorry.

282
00:22:08.526 --> 00:22:12.373
- Hurry up!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

283
00:22:12.373 --> 00:22:16.643
An elite should know better.
You made us wait both ways!

284
00:22:16.643 --> 00:22:20.172
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, stop it!

285
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:23.015
<i>We took a photo together,
and exchanged phone numbers.</i>

286
00:22:23.015 --> 00:22:25.430
One, two, three!

287
00:22:25.988 --> 00:22:29.817
<i>We agreed to meet at Gapyeong Garden
for a drink next week.</i>

288
00:22:41.889 --> 00:22:44.958
<i>But, strangely...</i>

289
00:22:44.958 --> 00:22:47.899
<i>I feel like I came to
a new place for a vacation.</i>

290
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.469
<i>Even though it's my own house.</i>

291
00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:58.065
<i>I'm sure we'll be able to talk about
things like this one day.</i>

292
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:04.151
<i>Because... we'll meet again one day.</i>

293
00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:10.181
<i>It's been a long time since I've
been home, but nothing has changed.</i>

294
00:23:10.181 --> 00:23:12.682
<i>Everything is in its rightful place.</i>

295
00:23:13.294 --> 00:23:16.961
<i>My clothes, my books, my makeup.</i>

296
00:23:16.961 --> 00:23:19.053
<i>And my friend too.</i>

297
00:23:20.874 --> 00:23:23.593
<i>But everything still looks different.</i>

298
00:23:23.593 --> 00:23:28.438
<i>My friend, the landscapes,
and the atmosphere.</i>

299
00:23:28.438 --> 00:23:30.625
<i>My face looks different too.</i>

300
00:23:34.087 --> 00:23:38.382
<i>I'm going to meet a new group
of strangers today.</i>

301
00:23:39.013 --> 00:23:43.908
<i>The only thing that's familiar to me
are the shoes you gave me.</i>

302
00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:49.999
<i>I'll have a nice day.</i>

303
00:23:49.999 --> 00:23:53.285
<i>I hope you have a good day too.</i>

304
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:14.390
Hello! I'm back!

305
00:24:21.325 --> 00:24:25.899
- Did you have fun?
- I bought what you wanted.

306
00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:28.389
I was lonely. Let's go.

307
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.811
You've been put on standby.

308
00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:42.889
I cleaned it off.
I didn't want anyone else to do it.

309
00:25:03.046 --> 00:25:04.844
Don't trust Deputy Oh.

310
00:25:11.432 --> 00:25:13.157
Did you have a good trip?

311
00:25:14.576 --> 00:25:19.094
You look even better.
Didn't you miss me?

312
00:25:19.094 --> 00:25:21.958
Do you want to explain
the 1.4 billion won charge?

313
00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:25.514
- They're just trying to scare you.
- Is that all it takes?

314
00:25:25.514 --> 00:25:27.401
Be honest. You're scared.

315
00:25:32.738 --> 00:25:34.712
Confirm that you don't have the files

316
00:25:34.712 --> 00:25:38.253
and sign an agreement
that you won't harm the company.

317
00:25:39.151 --> 00:25:41.784
Rather than causing trouble by firing you

318
00:25:41.784 --> 00:25:44.394
they'd prefer to keep you
and manage you carefully.

319
00:25:44.394 --> 00:25:46.129
They'll cancel the lawsuit too.

320
00:25:47.109 --> 00:25:51.058
If I sign that, the truth
that I know will become a lie.

321
00:25:51.058 --> 00:25:53.259
That's what they want.

322
00:25:55.843 --> 00:25:57.911
Is that why they sued me?

323
00:25:57.911 --> 00:26:00.526
As long as I agree with them,
it becomes a lie.

324
00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:02.419
It's not that difficult.

325
00:26:03.323 --> 00:26:07.929
It's not over yet.
Your job here, and our relationship.

326
00:26:08.441 --> 00:26:10.556
We can start over from scratch.

327
00:26:12.301 --> 00:26:17.163
Don't feel sad.
I did my best to fight for you.

328
00:26:20.131 --> 00:26:23.179
- You knew, didn't you?
- What?

329
00:26:23.179 --> 00:26:27.575
That the company is testing
their new drugs. You knew, right?

330
00:26:28.302 --> 00:26:32.402
You ordered me to ship those
containers, even though you knew, right?

331
00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:36.131
You should have told me
you were on their side.

332
00:26:36.853 --> 00:26:39.241
Then it wouldn't have hurt so much.

333
00:26:41.825 --> 00:26:43.198
I'm off.

334
00:27:16.518 --> 00:27:19.334
Did you wait long?
We were stuck in traffic.

335
00:27:26.263 --> 00:27:28.244
I missed you, Na Hyun.

336
00:27:57.516 --> 00:27:59.308
I wanted to eat at a nice restaurant.

337
00:27:59.308 --> 00:28:01.306
France influenced me.

338
00:28:01.306 --> 00:28:05.075
After sitting in outdoor cafes
all week, I feel stuffy inside.

339
00:28:05.075 --> 00:28:08.133
- You're a French woman now.
- I am.

340
00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:12.134
And... thank you.

341
00:28:13.325 --> 00:28:18.458
You recommended restaurants
everywhere I went, and took care of me.

342
00:28:18.458 --> 00:28:21.957
I don't like where this is going.
I feel anxious.

343
00:28:21.957 --> 00:28:26.634
I was really happy...
when you proposed to me.

344
00:28:26.634 --> 00:28:28.946
I was really happy.

345
00:28:29.565 --> 00:28:33.948
But it wasn't because I liked you.

346
00:28:33.948 --> 00:28:36.139
I just liked the situation.

347
00:28:37.846 --> 00:28:42.249
"I can't believe such a cool man
likes me. It's not over for me just yet."

348
00:28:42.249 --> 00:28:44.227
You know how it is.

349
00:28:45.584 --> 00:28:47.563
I'm mean, aren't I?

350
00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:52.092
- You're a bad woman.
- You're right.

351
00:28:53.538 --> 00:28:56.816
Because a cool man liked me

352
00:28:56.816 --> 00:29:00.076
I felt like I became a cool woman too.

353
00:29:00.768 --> 00:29:03.014
It's a pitiful thought...

354
00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:06.757
but I felt like I had more worth.

355
00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:13.073
As a result... I started
liking you more and more.

356
00:29:13.988 --> 00:29:17.495
Because you made me
into a pretty cool woman.

357
00:29:19.082 --> 00:29:20.756
That's why...

358
00:29:23.484 --> 00:29:29.036
every time I fight with my
boyfriend, I become a bad person.

359
00:29:31.844 --> 00:29:33.753
Do you have a boyfriend?

360
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.103
Yes, I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you earlier.

361
00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:46.120
I figured. That time...

362
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.895
You're going on a vacation, huh?

363
00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.641
With whom?

364
00:29:59.038 --> 00:30:01.053
With a friend.

365

Your answer was delayed,
so I thought I had a chance.

366

I just didn't want anyone at work
to know I was going with my boyfriend.

367

It doesn't matter.
I still would have proposed

even if I knew you had a boyfriend.

369
00:30:21.211 --> 00:30:24.471
- Is this a rejection?
- Yes.

370
00:30:43.523 --> 00:30:46.650
Don't switch departments.
And don't move companies either.

I won't go anywhere until
someone offers me higher pay.

373

You were absent without leave.

385
00:31:56.705 --> 00:31:59.555
I heard about the approval cancelation
when I was on vacation.

I couldn't come to work

Then you were absent without leave.

You also stole your superior's ID
and uncovered the company's secret...

389
00:32:06.952 --> 00:32:09.448
I used his ID, but I didn't steal it.

390

That's similar to saying
you hit him but didn't beat him up.

Did you... delete the files?

It'll get complicated if you still

you're slandering the company

00:32:59.694 --> 00:33:02.421
so there wouldn't be
any documents either.

405
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:06.151
I've never received that order,
and I never made it either.

406
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:08.125
This is clearly...

an effort to sabotage our company

There are no records

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.796
Yes, Chief. I'm almost done.
I just need to add a period.

472
00:39:21.796 --> 00:39:24.662
It's not a mountain.
It's Tombland Island.

473
00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:27.780
You can go there when the tide is low...

474
00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.276
Just the same old.

475
00:39:59.495 --> 00:40:02.044
We're not finished. Sit down.

476
00:40:02.044 --> 00:40:04.209
It's true that I don't have anything.

477
00:40:06.597 --> 00:40:08.693
This is all I have.

478
00:40:08.693 --> 00:40:13.680
The missing documents and the supply
that was sent to Africa are all here.

479
00:40:16.135 --> 00:40:17.941
Let's take it to the end.

480
00:40:38.044 --> 00:40:40.073
What? Are you done already?

481
00:40:40.073 --> 00:40:43.350
I was planning to yell on my way in.

482
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.997
Can you still call yourselves elite?

483
00:40:46.531 --> 00:40:52.249
If you study hard and get a good job,
does that make you better than everyone?

484
00:40:53.539 --> 00:40:56.392
You don't have the right
to yell at anyone.

485
00:40:56.392 --> 00:40:58.591
I was going to yell the loudest at you.

486
00:41:02.401 --> 00:41:05.564
Listen to this punk.
How loud were you going to yell?

487
00:41:05.564 --> 00:41:08.031
Yell if you can!

488
00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:11.457
What's the use of yelling
at another slave?

489
00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:15.789
Do you think I don't know that?

490
00:41:15.789 --> 00:41:18.446
Everyone in this office knows it!

491
00:41:18.446 --> 00:41:20.488
But why do I live like this?

492
00:41:21.127 --> 00:41:24.162
It's because there are
ranks among slaves, too.

493
00:41:26.443 --> 00:41:30.318
I see. I hope you live that way forever.

494
00:41:48.711 --> 00:41:51.595
Have you used it yet?

495
00:41:51.595 --> 00:41:53.591
I'm not lonely at night anymore.

496
00:41:54.917 --> 00:41:56.943
- I'll call you.
- Sure.

497
00:42:01.468 --> 00:42:03.510
<i>I'm doing well.</i>

498
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.495
<i>Are you doing well too?</i>

499
00:42:06.086 --> 00:42:11.352
<i>I feel like I could chat with you
all night at a French live bar.</i>

500
00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:45.671
<i>Maupassant, who wrote "Une Vie"...</i>

501
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.024
<i>That's the St. Vincent Cathedral.
Take the shuttle bus...</i>

502
00:43:24.024 --> 00:43:27.309
<i>These villas turned
into designer shops...</i>

503
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:29.901
<i>We're going to have lunch here...</i>

504
00:43:29.901 --> 00:43:33.356
<i>It's a shabby grave
for a world-famous painter.</i>

505
00:43:33.356 --> 00:43:35.794
<i>That's a painting by Van Gogh...</i>

506
00:43:35.794 --> 00:43:38.336
<i>At the top of the cathedral...</i>

507
00:43:38.336 --> 00:43:40.417
<i>The aristocrats of Europe gathered...</i>

508
00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:43.220
<i>Are you our guide?</i>

509
00:43:44.285 --> 00:43:45.551
<i>Yes!</i>

510
00:43:50.843 --> 00:43:52.836
<i>Go on a vacation.</i>

511
00:43:52.836 --> 00:43:56.173
Put down the flag, and travel freely.

512
00:44:12.664 --> 00:44:14.441
<i>I'm going on a vacation.</i>

513
00:44:17.368 --> 00:44:19.680
Why aren't you answering me?

514
00:44:22.486 --> 00:44:27.626
A guide is telling me she wants to go
on a vacation. What should I say?

515
00:44:27.626 --> 00:44:31.310
"I see. You wanted
to go on a vacation, huh?"

516
00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:33.345
"Then you must need money."

517
00:44:33.345 --> 00:44:36.281
"How much would you like?" Like this?

518
00:44:36.928 --> 00:44:38.870
So So is a good talker.

519
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:42.943
This is the biggest bullshit
I've heard in the last 10 years.

520
00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:47.301
Tomorrow's group has 22 people.
Did you check the reservations?

521
00:44:47.301 --> 00:44:49.100
I'm going on a vacation.

522
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:53.068
I haven't decided where to go,
so I don't know how long it'll take.

523
00:44:53.068 --> 00:44:56.553
Geez, your little brother lied to me

524
00:44:56.553 --> 00:45:01.187
and you're threatening me.
Am I your family's enemy?

525
00:45:01.682 --> 00:45:02.943
Why are you doing this to me?

526
00:45:02.943 --> 00:45:04.988
Boss, you do know what a vacation is?

527
00:45:04.988 --> 00:45:09.396
Of course I do. It's a business
that leaves less than 15% profit.

528
00:45:09.396 --> 00:45:13.426
It means to leave
for a vacation as a wanderer.

529
00:45:13.426 --> 00:45:15.481
That's a real vacation.

530
00:45:15.481 --> 00:45:18.961
You're a real talker, aren't you?
Are you serious?

531
00:45:18.961 --> 00:45:20.104
Yes.

532
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:25.296
Fine, then take a package vacation.
I'll give you a discount.

533
00:45:25.296 --> 00:45:27.068
Gosh.

534
00:46:18.004 --> 00:46:20.457
Chief, you have a package.

535
00:46:20.457 --> 00:46:22.908
- Who sent it?
- It's...

536
00:46:22.908 --> 00:46:24.845
from Ma Ru.

537
00:46:24.845 --> 00:46:26.138
Ma Ru?

538
00:46:36.035 --> 00:46:40.010
<i>I will express what I couldn't say
with a small gift.</i>

539
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.781
This punk. I guess he
reflected on his actions.

540
00:46:50.794 --> 00:46:52.609
What's this?

541
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:55.640
Is this a dog or a bird?
("Dog" and "bird" sound like "bastard.")

542
00:46:58.089 --> 00:47:00.289
This son of a bitch...

543
00:50:05.758 --> 00:50:09.752
<i>[Honey, don't be sick, so we can
live a long, happy life together...]</i>

544
00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.776
<i>Honey, how have you been?</i>

545
00:50:15.332 --> 00:50:17.591
<i>I'm going to get married.</i>

546
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:23.285
<i>I'll raise Na Hyun well,
and do my best to be happy.</i>

547
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:31.158
<i>Please let me hit it big in one shot!</i>

548
00:50:35.048 --> 00:50:38.160
<i>Please help me so that I won't be
swayed by anyone or anything.</i>

549
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.006
<i>Please help me to be happy.</i>

550
00:50:40.921 --> 00:50:43.562
<i>Go away, pimples! A promotion for Dad!</i>

551
00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:45.287
<i>I want a boyfriend too!</i>

552
00:50:49.229 --> 00:50:56.269
<i>I hope my entire family
will live a happy and healthy life.</i>

553
00:51:06.385 --> 00:51:07.957
What are you going to write?

554
00:51:08.774 --> 00:51:13.486
"I want to go home."
These five syllables.

555
00:51:13.486 --> 00:51:15.687
You just got here.

556
00:51:15.687 --> 00:51:19.118
I caused a commotion at work,
and I have personal matters too.

557
00:51:19.118 --> 00:51:21.022
I don't think I should have come.

558
00:51:21.022 --> 00:51:23.955
I want to just go home.

559
00:51:23.955 --> 00:51:28.403
I understand. That could
actually be everyone's wish.

560
00:51:49.312 --> 00:51:52.323
Yes, Chief. I'm almost done.

561
00:51:52.323 --> 00:51:54.743
I just need to add a period.

562
00:51:54.743 --> 00:51:58.406
I can't finish in a minute.
Maybe in a few hours...

563
00:52:02.656 --> 00:52:05.834
<i>[Go home...]</i>

564
00:52:54.421 --> 00:53:00.059
<i>[I want to go home.]</i>

565
00:53:03.015 --> 00:53:05.993
- Wow!
- That's why...

566
00:53:05.993 --> 00:53:08.142
Did you wait long?

567
00:53:08.142 --> 00:53:09.734
Geez.

568
00:53:13.479 --> 00:53:16.548
- It's bland.
- It's bland?

569
00:53:16.548 --> 00:53:20.031
Why can't a restaurant
get the flavor right?

570
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:23.305
Can you still call this
a premium chicken soup?

571
00:53:23.305 --> 00:53:26.588
- I want to talk to your boss!
- Stop it already.

572
00:53:26.588 --> 00:53:30.117
Why do you always tell me to stop?

573
00:53:30.718 --> 00:53:32.872
Call the boss!

574
00:53:32.872 --> 00:53:36.981
Gosh, stop it already. I was wrong, okay?

575
00:53:36.981 --> 00:53:41.162
If it's bland, you should
ask for salt, not the boss.

576
00:53:41.162 --> 00:53:44.104
Call the salt!

577
00:53:44.104 --> 00:53:46.957
I want to talk to salt!
What's his number?

578
00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:50.066
Geez, seriously. I've had enough of this.

579
00:53:50.066 --> 00:53:53.847
Stop it. They're all having fun.

580
00:53:53.847 --> 00:53:56.301
- I think it's funny too.
- You...

581
00:53:56.301 --> 00:53:59.859
Kyung Jae, I heard you hit it big.

582
00:53:59.859 --> 00:54:02.720
- Geez, it's no big deal.
- That's right.

583
00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.981
I saw it on the internet.

584
00:54:03.981 --> 00:54:07.118
- How much did you make?
- It's not much.

585
00:54:07.118 --> 00:54:08.767
Aren't you supposed to give out gifts?

586
00:54:08.767 --> 00:54:10.941
That's why we brought these.

587
00:54:10.941 --> 00:54:14.646
- Geez, I'm embarrassed.
- Hurry up.

588
00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.950
Wow, you were preparing for a business.
Who knew you'd become a writer?

589
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:20.481
I know, right?

590
00:54:21.434 --> 00:54:26.013
I like the title.
"How to Win at Life as a Dirt Spoon."

591
00:54:26.013 --> 00:54:28.339
Writer Kim Kyung Jae.

592
00:54:28.339 --> 00:54:33.010
Amazing. There's nothing
written inside. This is hilarious.

593
00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.118
- You're right.
- There's no method, is there?

594
00:54:36.118 --> 00:54:38.593
Geez, who would buy these?

595
00:54:38.593 --> 00:54:40.446
This is a best-seller right now.

596
00:54:40.446 --> 00:54:43.051
How did you come up with this idea?

597
00:54:43.051 --> 00:54:46.671
I failed my business
and got betrayed by a senior I trusted.

598
00:54:46.671 --> 00:54:48.818
I really wanted to die.

599
00:55:15.526 --> 00:55:17.606
<i>[The Secret to a Businessman's Success]</i>

600
00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:20.740
I'm sure there's a way
people can succeed.

601
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:24.187
But not for me. That's why I made this.

602
00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:27.917
There's no way for a dirt spoon
to succeed in one shot.

603
00:55:27.917 --> 00:55:29.546
Did you bring this to the publisher?

604
00:55:29.546 --> 00:55:33.633
I wanted to sell it as a notebook,
so I looked into crowdfunding

605
00:55:33.633 --> 00:55:37.606
but a publisher contacted me
and said they'd publish it.

606
00:55:37.606 --> 00:55:41.252
I guess you saved on ink costs.
Aren't you making money too easily?

607
00:55:41.252 --> 00:55:44.214
Gosh, you're too much.

608
00:55:44.214 --> 00:55:45.649
Did you bring one for Ma Ru?

609
00:55:45.649 --> 00:55:48.597
I have one for him,
but I can't contact him.

610
00:55:48.597 --> 00:55:52.783
By the way, is our elite doing well?

611
00:55:52.783 --> 00:55:55.493
Has it been three months now?
Is he still in Africa?

612
00:55:55.493 --> 00:55:58.539
Yes, I talk to him from
time to time. He's doing well.

613
00:55:58.539 --> 00:56:01.810
- Did he really go on vacation?
- Of course.

614
00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:04.010
I saw him the day before he left.

615
00:56:10.097 --> 00:56:12.298
I've always thought this way.

616
00:56:12.298 --> 00:56:15.874
"I did nothing wrong.
The company was wrong."

617
00:56:16.475 --> 00:56:18.896
You can never love a company too much.

618
00:56:18.896 --> 00:56:23.160
But I thought about it, and realized
that I was a part of the company.

619
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:26.292
Therefore, we were both
responsible for this crime.

620
00:56:26.292 --> 00:56:30.470
Just forget about it.
You'll probably lose this battle.

621
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:33.510
Regardless of who will win,
we should apologize first.

622
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:39.055
You can't just go to Africa
and apologize to everyone you see.

623
00:56:47.394 --> 00:56:50.530
- Are you going?
- Yes.

624
00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:51.823
That's something you'd do.

625
00:56:51.823 --> 00:56:55.932
I'll go and check if there were
side effects, offer treatments

626
00:56:55.932 --> 00:56:57.937
and discard any leftover medicine.

627
00:56:57.937 --> 00:57:02.615
Yeah, that's one way to apologize.
And you'll have evidence too.

628
00:57:03.229 --> 00:57:05.198
I can't do much,
but I'll do what I can to help.

629
00:57:05.198 --> 00:57:07.696
Please just keep this a secret.

630
00:57:07.696 --> 00:57:12.671
He's going all over the place,
so his vacation was extended.

631
00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.986
This is why it's great
working in a big corporation!

632
00:57:15.986 --> 00:57:18.714
Did he take a direct flight?
It must have been expensive.

633
00:57:18.714 --> 00:57:21.673
No, he had a layover in England
on his way there

634
00:57:21.673 --> 00:57:25.111
and he'll stop in France on his way back.

635
00:57:29.716 --> 00:57:33.412
But... I wonder if our pretty
Big Sis Guide is doing well.

636
00:57:33.412 --> 00:57:35.856
I'm sure she's doing well.

637
00:57:35.856 --> 00:57:37.872
I'm sure she is.

638
00:57:37.872 --> 00:57:41.763
- I hope so.
- I hope she's doing well.

639
00:57:42.303 --> 00:57:44.381
I miss her.

640
00:58:09.499 --> 00:58:11.240
<i>Buy yourself a traveling bag.</i>

641
00:58:13.999 --> 00:58:16.685
Are you worried a guide
doesn't have a proper bag?

642
00:58:17.486 --> 00:58:21.441
What... does a travel bag mean to you?

643
00:58:23.059 --> 00:58:27.696
<i>If you pack a bag,
you'll learn who you are.</i>

644
00:58:27.696 --> 00:58:30.528
<i>It's not just about packing some clothes.</i>

645
00:58:30.528 --> 00:58:32.272
Cold medicine.

646
00:58:34.417 --> 00:58:38.149
<i>You'll realize what you like the most.</i>

647
00:58:38.149 --> 00:58:41.178
<i>And what you're the most scared of.</i>

648
00:58:41.178 --> 00:58:42.615
Mosquito medicine.

649
00:58:44.026 --> 00:58:47.671
<i>You'll also realize
what you have to give up.</i>

650
00:58:48.847 --> 00:58:52.917
<i>And you'll learn
what you mustn't give up.</i>

651
00:58:54.414 --> 00:58:56.013
<i>What do you think?</i>

652
00:59:01.472 --> 00:59:06.316
<i>Buy a new bag, and pack your things.</i>

653
00:59:06.316 --> 00:59:09.443
<i>If you do, you'll learn who you are</i>

654
00:59:09.443 --> 00:59:15.122
<i>and you'll also realize
where it is that you want to go.</i>

655
00:59:33.568 --> 00:59:35.292
<i>I'm back.</i>

656
00:59:36.338 --> 00:59:37.758
<i>I'll come again.</i>

657
00:59:52.943 --> 00:59:54.510
<i>I'll be back.</i>

658
01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.972
Was it in the first year
of college? In April?

659
01:00:34.972 --> 01:00:38.548
Soo Soo went on a trip
to Gyeongju. Try to remember.

660
01:00:38.548 --> 01:00:41.834
That's right. My daughter also...

661
01:00:41.834 --> 01:00:45.376
went to Gyeongju then.
You went together, didn't you?

662
01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:47.321
- You tricked us.
- See?

663
01:00:47.321 --> 01:00:49.225
If we interrogate them,
we'll get the answers.

664
01:00:49.225 --> 01:00:54.220
At bride and groom meetings, aren't you
supposed to brag about your children

665
01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.709
and ask us to take care of each other?

666
01:00:56.709 --> 01:00:59.508
Are you children we can brag about?

667
01:01:01.274 --> 01:01:04.653
I told you to turn off your phone
during important meetings.

668
01:01:04.653 --> 01:01:05.952
I'm sorry.

669
01:01:10.684 --> 01:01:13.896
- Big Sis?
- Is it So So?

670
01:01:14.479 --> 01:01:17.468
Yeah, it's me. I'm at the airport.

671
01:01:17.468 --> 01:01:19.812
You are? Which one?

672
01:01:19.812 --> 01:01:23.106
Charles de Gaulle Airport.
I'm going home.

673
01:01:23.106 --> 01:01:25.736
You're coming home? Right now?

674
01:01:26.414 --> 01:01:28.868
Not for good.

675
01:01:28.868 --> 01:01:33.522
I still have school and work
to wrap up, so I'm just dropping by.

676
01:01:50.615 --> 01:01:51.914
Mom?

677
01:01:53.522 --> 01:01:54.919
Did you eat?

678
01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:00.673
I ate. What about you, Mom?

679
01:02:02.343 --> 01:02:06.187
Travel safely. And don't go
anywhere dangerous, okay?

680
01:02:06.187 --> 01:02:08.151
Am I a baby?

681
01:02:13.379 --> 01:02:16.251
Mom, when I came to France

682
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:20.751
I bought plates, side dishes,
and everything I needed.

683
01:02:20.751 --> 01:02:24.425
But I realized I didn't have
a blanket when I went to bed.

684
01:02:24.425 --> 01:02:26.881
So I went to buy a blanket the next day

685
01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:30.957
but I realized that that was my
first time buying a blanket on my own.

686
01:02:31.575 --> 01:02:35.986
Even though I've bought clothes
and makeup on my own before.

687
01:02:37.388 --> 01:02:39.298
You're all grown up, my daughter.

688
01:02:40.039 --> 01:02:43.147
A woman is all grown up
once she buys a blanket by herself.

689
01:02:46.678 --> 01:02:48.048
Yeah.

690
01:02:49.082 --> 01:02:51.419
But...

691
01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:56.713
while I bought the blanket...
I really missed you.

692
01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:05.189
Mom, I'm sorry.

693
01:03:07.142 --> 01:03:08.655
I'm sorry.

694
01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:13.633
I'm the one who's sorry.

695
01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:48.906
Should we go to karaoke?

696
01:04:49.642 --> 01:04:52.763
So So is coming home,
so we should celebrate!

697
01:04:53.548 --> 01:04:55.689
<i>Carrying a backpack...</i>

698
01:04:56.455 --> 01:04:59.077
<i>on the green hills!</i>

699
01:04:59.702 --> 01:05:02.388
<i>Toward the field...</i>

700
01:05:02.388 --> 01:05:05.495
<i>where the golden sun festival opens...</i>

701
01:05:05.495 --> 01:05:08.332
<i>Toward the field...</i>

702
01:05:08.332 --> 01:05:11.024
<i>Toward the valley!</i>

703
01:05:11.024 --> 01:05:14.631
<i>As we look for the water
flowing through the valley...</i>

704
01:05:14.631 --> 01:05:17.656
<i>from where we hear the echo sounds!</i>

705
01:05:17.656 --> 01:05:23.035
<i>That's where we'll go for our vacation!</i>

706
01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:12.926
One more time.

707
01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:16.769
You can't just take pictures like that!

708
01:06:17.539 --> 01:06:19.365
Don't erase these pictures, okay?

709
01:06:40.689 --> 01:06:42.238
I'm late.

710
01:08:29.512 --> 01:08:34.984
<i>[Thank you for watching "The Package."]</i>

711
01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:45.355
