00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.960
(Episode 32)

2
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.459
5pm yesterday, in the parking lot of Hangang office, Lee Yu Beom...

3
00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:21.030
who was in a trial for the Mogok-dong's fall case...

4
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.869
killed a man named Mr. Choi who attended the trial as a witness.

5
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.639
Lee Yu Beom who was denying all the charges...

6
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.169
has confessed his crimes after the imprisonment.

7
00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.939
He has been charged for manipulating the IV drip serial murder case,

8
00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.980
murdering Ha Ju Won, the actual murderer of the IV drip murders,

9
00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:12.949
and attempted murder of Reporter Nam Hong Joo.

10
00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.719
The investigations by prosecutors will soon make progress.

11
00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.449
Prosecution added a charge of manslaughter for a hit-and-run.

12
00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.250
In the case of manipulating the IV drip murder case,

13
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.459
he will be facing additional charges of falsifying evidence,

14
00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.560
attempted murder, and manslaughter.

15
00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.490
Yu Beom, that jerk...

16
00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.530
He gets investigated today, right?

17
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.330
The investigation is done, but he said he has something to say.

18
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.000
He should shut his mouth. He has nothing to say.

19
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.240
What about Woo Tak? Is he not coming for breakfast now?

20
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.340
I think so. He's not picking up my calls.

21
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.810
Should we pack some food for him?

22
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.889
(Don't be afraid. I'll be right here for you every day until the end.)

23
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.290
Is your hand still trembling?

24
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.129
Yes, the doctor said nothing's wrong, but I don't know why.

25
00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.959
I know why it shakes. My hands used to tremble a lot.

26
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.600
Did they? What should I do with my hands then?

27
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.230
It takes a bit of time.

28
00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.969
But you can get over it. I'll help you.

29
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.540
You?

30
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.139
Yes.

31
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.279
So don't be afraid. I'll be here for you.

32
00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.850
Every day, until the end.

33
00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:34.060
I think I should be the one saying those words. You...

34
00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.389
This is what you said.

35
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.360
I said that? When?

36
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.170
I don't know when. In about a year, I guess.

37
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.400
- You heard this in your dream. - Yes.

38
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.770
And you said you want to say something to yourself now.

39
00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:49.869
What did I say?

40
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.310
Goodness. This brings back memories.

41
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.650
You're now a prosecutor investigating me.

42
00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.850
And I'm the defendant.

43
00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.319
Right.

44
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.319
Let's not type everything there.

45
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.690
I admitted to all of my crimes.

46
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.299
I know what you're thinking.

47
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.040
I know what everybody is thinking.

48
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.380
Lee Yu Beom, that jerk, is finally paying for what he has done.

49
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.110
Now justice...

50
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.190
is flowing properly like a river.

51
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.690
He gave up everything and is being wicked.

52
00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.089
He should be asking for forgiveness. Goodness.

53
00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:45.960
Don't be silly.

54
00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:51.100
Me being here today could be your future too.

55
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.339
What do you mean?

56
00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:59.040
The tipping point to the whole thing is the IV drip serial murder case.

57
00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.080
I, a prosecutor, let Ha Ju Won go,

58
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.219
and I concluded falsely that Myung Yi Suk is the guilty one.

59
00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.650
- Didn't I? - You did.

60
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.350
Everyone takes care of about 200 cases a month...

61
00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:13.020
and a few thousands a year.

62
00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.000
Do you think you all took care of every case in a proper way?

63
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.529
It's hard to get 100 percent right even on your dictation tests.

64
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.199
Among the cases that can easily ruin a person's life,

65
00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:27.540
among those thousands of cases,

66
00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.179
are you sure you never made a single mistake?

67
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.650
Come on. Be honest with yourselves.

68
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.619
You must have a few cases that went wrong.

69
00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:43.549
Hi there, Prosecutor Lee.

70
00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:46.560
You didn't do an autopsy and made a false claim.

71
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.060
And you, Prosecutor Shin.

72
00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.159
You falsely charged and missed Kang Dae Hee.

73
00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:54.100
There are quite a lot of cases that I know of.

74
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.400
How long will you guys last?

75
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.699
You're all standing there...

76
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.440
is just because you are lucky that your misjudgments weren't found.

77
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.069
The reason why I'm here...

78
00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:05.480
is my misjudgment has been found on a bad luck.

79
00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:07.279
I think...

80
00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:09.949
I was unlucky.

81
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.920
No.

82
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.089
You were bad.

83
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.330
When you investigated the IV drip case...

84
00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:23.630
You set Myung Yi Suk as your target and made the puzzle pieces fit.

85
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.159
You even falsified evidence to finish your puzzle,

86
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.770
but you knew all along that you were wrong.

87
00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:34.310
That's why you were so mad at us.

88
00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:39.839
So why would you investigate after already deciding on the result?

89
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.279
You should have tried to investigate and find out the result.

90
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.250
Maybe when you did that to us, it reminded of the things you did.

91
00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.389
That's why you were mad.

92
00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:54.790
You were not mad at us.

93
00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:01.199
You were mad at yourself.

94
00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:03.569
Am I right?

95
00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:06.199
No.

96
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.409
You hated yourself.

97
00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:16.549
I said no!

98
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.179
You thought your mistakes would be gone if you washed or blamed others.

99
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.589
You were scared.

100
00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:26.290
Shut it.

101
00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:28.060
You continued to hide and mask the facts...

102
00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:30.489
and felt guiltier as the days passed.

103
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.199
You didn't come here because your answer was wrong.

104
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.000
You came here because you insisted that the wrong answer was right.

105
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.009
You even had to kill Ha Ju Won and Mr. Choi to back up your plead.

106
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.279
You kept insisting the wrong answer was right.

107
00:07:50.049 --> 00:07:51.619
That is why you're here.

108
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:01.960
You aren't unlucky.

109
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.060
You are bad.

110
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.739
The defendant, Lee Yu Beom,

111
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.850
who, as a prosecutor, should have sought the truth,

112
00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:22.850
instead sought after fame and money.

113
00:08:23.409 --> 00:08:26.779
As a result, he let the real culprit go and caused the deaths of many.

114
00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:30.860
The defendant used to be a prosecutor who charges people...

115
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.489
and punished those who committed crimes.

116
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.600
However, the defendant continued the path he was on...

117
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.369
despite knowing that what he was doing was wrong.

118
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.699
While on his way, he killed and hurt many people.

119
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.980
I hope...

120
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.880
that in this country,

121
00:08:57.009 --> 00:08:59.080
those who protect the law will be accountable...

122
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.719
when they enforce the law.

123
00:09:04.089 --> 00:09:07.230
To many innocent ones who lost lives because of the defendant,

124
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.730
I, hereby, apologize on behalf of him as a prosecutor.

125
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.029
I demand his charges.

126
00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:24.339
Please sentence...

127
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.409
Lee Yu Beom to a life sentence.

128
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.179
Mr. Choi should have seen this.

129
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.630
Do you still read these books?

130
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.170
Hong Joo?

131
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.000
It's 11am. Get up now.

132
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:29.170
It's so dusty!

133
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.810
You haven't read them for years.

134
00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:34.650
You won't read them in the next three years too.

135
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.549
What's with the books? What three years?

136
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.449
I want to give them to Woo Tak.

137
00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:41.389
Woo Tak is applying for law school.

138
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.190
Really? He never said that. When did he say that?

139
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.219
He said that in my dream.

140
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.830
He has to study for years without any income.

141
00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:51.699
So let's help him save money on books.

142
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.600
Okay. Sure. I should.

143
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.529
Bring your luggage out.

144
00:10:55.569 --> 00:10:56.600
Sure.

145
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.750
Who's at the door?

146
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.520
Who is it?

147
00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:14.889
It's me, Hong Joo.

148
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.219
It's me!

149
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.819
- What brought you here? - I brought some gifts!

150
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.259
Hold on a second. I'll be out in a minute.

151
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.600
Goodness.

152
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:33.569
You look the same as Jae Chan when you don't go to work.

153
00:11:34.969 --> 00:11:37.170
- Is that a compliment? - Do you think it is?

154
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.940
What are these?

155
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.110
My dream took me a year later.

156
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.610
You go to law school.

157
00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.619
Me? At this age?

158
00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:48.319
Yes, you, at that age, listening to lectures with young girls.

159
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.190
I'm so jealous! Truly.

160
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.259
No way. Me? Law school?

161
00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.500
It makes sense.

162
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.730
When I saw you defending Do Hak Young last time,

163
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.330
you were more versed in the law than me.

164
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.170
You even told me you excelled in law at the police academy.

165
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.940
I wasn't just good. I was the top.

166
00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:10.040
Goodness.

167
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.980
My mom made these for you.

168
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.380
My mom will take care of your meals while you study in law school.

169
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.819
You guys don't have to do this.

170
00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:22.489
Everyone is doing this for you. So clean your room, and shave!

171
00:12:22.489 --> 00:12:25.089
Did you feed Robin? He must be hungry!

172
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:28.960
Robin, have you eaten? Robin!

173
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.529
Robin, did you go for a walk?

174
00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:34.199
Hi. Stay still.

175
00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:37.869
You sure brought a lot of stuff. How did you bring them without a car?

176
00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:39.869
We have a car.

177
00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:41.639
You have a car?

178
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.380
Honey.

179
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.980
I'm on my way on a bus.

180
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:51.580
Jae Chan wanted to borrow my car.

181
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.420
I don't know. He wanted to carry some stuff.

182
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:56.520
The bus is better than my car.

183
00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.489
Bye.

184
00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:04.860
I think you can get up now.

185
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.170
(Don't be afraid. I'll be right here for you every day until the end.)

186
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.569
(It was Woo Tak.)

187
00:13:14.909 --> 00:13:16.440
Give me the key. I'll drive.

188
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:17.509
Here.

189
00:13:19.409 --> 00:13:20.440
My hand is not shaking anymore.

190
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.380
It was Woo Tak.

191
00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:26.880
I told you that I could help you with your hands.

192
00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:29.219
You drive.

193
00:13:31.989 --> 00:13:33.020
You helped me?

194
00:13:33.819 --> 00:13:34.929
When?

195
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.400
Now. Just now.

196
00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:39.699
Just now?

(Prologue)

199
00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:14.270
(Say thank you to my brother.)

200
00:14:17.469 --> 00:14:19.600
My brother just told me.

201
00:14:20.339 --> 00:14:22.110
Lee Yu Beom is sentenced...

202
00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:24.310
as my brother demanded.

203
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:26.540
Life imprisonment.

204
00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:39.819
What should I say?

205
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.989
Can't say it was a good thing.

206
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.360
Say thank you to your brother.

207
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600
Okay.

208
00:14:53.969 --> 00:14:54.969
So Yoon.

209
00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:58.509
Sorry. I'll call you later.

210
00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:01.549
Did you say So Yoon?

211
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.420
Why would So Yoon call you?

212
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.790
We're going out.

213
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.449
No way.

214
00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:11.690
It's true. We're going out.

215
00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:13.259
See this?

216
00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:15.830
You photoshopped this.

217
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.900
No, I did not.

218
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.670
Why would So Yoon go out with you?

219
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.770
Do you think I'm a pervert? Photoshopping her face?

220
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.799
Okay. Let's just say you two go out.

221
00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:27.310
Get out. I have to arrange stuff.

222
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.770
What? No. I mean...

223
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:30.779
This is real.

224
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.350

If the bride and the groom are both colleagues from work,

227
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.670
how do you have to pay the congratulatory money?

228
00:15:54.699 --> 00:15:57.270
Your friend's wedding is today?

229
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.270
It confuses me. I don't know how to pay.

230
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.440
Do you have to pay double?

231
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.670
Or do you have to divide into two?

232
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.540
Don't you have to give them separately?

233
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.940
You have to pay double.

234
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.409
Just give to the closer one.

235
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.750
You're the MC there. Do you even have to pay?

236
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.850
I don't have to pay?

237
00:16:13.119 --> 00:16:14.119
No.

238
00:16:15.489 --> 00:16:16.690
Is the cleaner's open now?

239
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.119
My blouse for the wedding is there.

240
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.029
I will pick it up for you after I deliver the food to Woo Tak.

241
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.900
Mother, just a moment.

242
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.630
What is this?

243
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.529
The prosecutor is me, and the policeman is Woo Tak?

244
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.770
That... That... That...

245
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.440
What did you count on us?

246
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.770
Looks like some scores.

247
00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.009
You scored less.

248
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:39.009
Right? It looks like she scored us.

249
00:16:39.009 --> 00:16:40.650
I scored this long time ago.

250
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.850
Throw it away.

251
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.449
I'm late. I have to go. Have the meal without me.

252
00:16:46.449 --> 00:16:48.549
Mother, answer me first.

253
00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:49.889
Mom, your breakfast!

254
00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:51.020
I don't feel like eating.

255
00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:52.989
This. This! Tell me.

256
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.730
Mother, try this.

257
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:59.759
Okay.

258
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.369
This tastes so good.

259
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.779
If you master japchae, that means you mastered Korean food.

260
00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:11.810
Making japchae is easy.

261
00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:12.909
No, it's not.

262
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.710
We wouldn’t eat japchae for special occasions if it was easy to make.

263
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:18.480
Policeman Han, you don't have to learn cooking anymore.

264
00:17:21.989 --> 00:17:25.560
I should stop calling you Policeman Han.

265
00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:26.989
Have you decided your career path?

266
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.929
What should I call you? Judge Han?

267
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.960
Prosecutor Han? Lawyer Han?

268
00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:34.830
Lawyer Han.

269
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.239
I think I suit better to advocate for someone than to judge.

270
00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:40.339
Lawyer Han. Lawyer Han. I like it.

271
00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:41.540
It really sticks.

272
00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:51.719
Goodness.

273
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.420
- Thank you so much. - You should be careful, ma'am.

274
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.589
Thank you, again.

275
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.230
What a bummer. I'll be late to the wedding!

276
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.429
Where did the driver go?

277
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.940
- What are you doing? - Do you own this car?

278
00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:16.610
I accidentally hit your car.

279
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:17.810
So this...

280
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.150
- Just go. - Sorry?

281
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.279
The bumper here is for you to bump against.

282
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.980
If you feel sorry,

283
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.089
you do the same if someone bumps into your car.

284
00:18:30.449 --> 00:18:31.460
Thank you.

285
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.440
Yes, I got the bouquet.

286
00:18:44.569 --> 00:18:46.100
Who is collecting the money?

287
00:18:49.739 --> 00:18:51.909
- Thank you. - Are you okay?

288
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:54.610
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

289
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.779
I could have been in trouble. What a relief.

290
00:18:58.049 --> 00:18:59.279
Hello? You know what happened?

291
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.000
What about this?

292
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.529
I think we should put this outward.

293
00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:20.270
Why should I even be here?

294
00:19:20.469 --> 00:19:23.710
You must come here for the closest colleague of my brother.

295
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.509
And I have someone to show.

296
00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:27.650
Show me? Who?

297
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.469
This. Is this your tie?

298
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.679
Park So Yoon?

299
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.210
So Yoon.

300
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.150
Did you miss me a lot?

301
00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:07.179
Yes, I missed you so much.

302
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:10.420
You two really are going out?

303
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.759
You think we lied to you?

304
00:20:13.089 --> 00:20:16.389
Do you still think this is photoshopped?

305
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.630
No, it looks real.

306
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.830
Alright, then.

307
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.369
So Yoon, you really are here.

308
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.139
You flew all the way here to play the piano for the wedding?

309
00:20:27.569 --> 00:20:31.080
Yes, someone asked me a favor, and I have many other reasons too.

310
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.480
How's the water pressure at your school dorm bathroom?

311
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.250
You need specially stronger water pressure for you.

312
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.319
That poop. Wasn't it revealed that it wasn't mine?

313
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.619
I don't know. It still seems like it's yours.

314
00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:44.759
That poop isn't mine!

315
00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:47.230
It was your poop! Your mother tried to protect you.

316
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.830
My mother is not a person like that.

317
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.860
- Did you just talk about... - How did the bride and groom...

318
00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.929
hide it from your colleagues? They must've have dated secretly.

319
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.239
Don't even start. They got caught ridiculously.

320
00:20:57.239 --> 00:20:59.569
- Stop! - You should stop.

321
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.110
You overstated the purchase and construction costs by...

322
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.210
1.1 billion dollars.

323
00:21:05.509 --> 00:21:08.679
Embezzlement and malfeasance also included.

324
00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:12.150
I did not overstate. It's the actual cost.

325
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.889
Look here at the offerings.

326
00:21:13.889 --> 00:21:17.219
I know. You paid every time.

327
00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.860
If you give offerings,

328
00:21:22.389 --> 00:21:26.199
do you think you will be forgiven for embezzlement?

329
00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.270
No. What's with him?

330
00:21:35.369 --> 00:21:36.670
Oh, my gosh.

331
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:41.409
He took mine instead of his lip balm.

332
00:21:49.989 --> 00:21:51.690
Bride, please make your way!

333
00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:01.969
Be happy!

334
00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:08.270
Pretty. Pretty!

335
00:22:08.739 --> 00:22:10.210
You look beautiful.

336
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.239
So gorgeous!

337
00:22:14.949 --> 00:22:16.049
That little boy.

338
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.619
So pretty!

339
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.150
That boy's the son of Ms. Son?

340
00:22:22.949 --> 00:22:25.589
He looks much healthier now. What a relief.

341
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.360
You're pretty, Ms. Son!

342
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.270
Bride and groom, please kiss each other.

343
00:22:36.969 --> 00:22:38.900
Come on!

344
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.639
Why is your kiss so reverent?

345
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.639
Kiss again like a couple in a wedding!

346
00:22:43.639 --> 00:22:45.810
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

347
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.779
My son is watching us.

348
00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:50.949
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

349
00:22:50.949 --> 00:22:52.980
Thank you, Chan Woo! You're a grown man!

350
00:23:01.929 --> 00:23:02.960
You're handsome!

351
00:23:13.139 --> 00:23:15.409
Bride, let's throw the bouquet.

352
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.380
Whoever is receiving, please stand behind her.

353
00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.580
Okay. Now, throw it!

354
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.150
Pretty!

355
00:23:27.949 --> 00:23:30.250
Oh, no. Prosecutor Jung must get married.

356
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.560
You did it on purpose, right?

357
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.429
No, no. I didn't. Take it again.

358
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.330
- Do it again. - Let's get it.

359
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.130
Throw it here.

360
00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:42.969
Throw it well.

361
00:23:42.969 --> 00:23:45.199
Throw it on a count of three.

362
00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:47.810
1, 2, 3.

363
00:23:58.179 --> 00:24:00.150
Gosh! Nice!

364
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.819
What's wrong? Did you have a bad dream again?

365
00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:41.360
Yes.

366
00:24:46.929 --> 00:24:48.869
It's okay. It's all over.

367
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.969
Don't be afraid. I'm here next to you.

368
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.569
Every day until the end. I'll be here,

369
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.279
so don't be afraid. I'll be next to you.

370
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.909
Every day until the end.

371
00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:08.650
This was it. What you said a year ago.

372
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.429
Yes. I dreamed about this moment a year ago.

373
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.259
I was in bad shape.

374
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.199
Blaming myself for Woo Tak and Mr. Choi.

375
00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:22.000
Do you have anything to say then?

376
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.469
To me?

377
00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:27.339
Well.

378
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:30.909
Tell me...

379
00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:34.509
I'll investigate it right. Trust me.

380
00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:36.650
Don't worry. This is what a prosecutor should be saying.

381
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.119
This is what my brother should be saying.

382
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.319
This will all pass.

383
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.360
This may look like something big.

384
00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:53.529
Dad gets out of the prison.

385
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.029
And my horrible times will begin again.

386
00:25:57.369 --> 00:25:59.339
When things pass, they are nothing.

387
00:26:00.469 --> 00:26:02.170
I think we should do an autopsy.

388
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.339
As a parent, I think we must do that.

389
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.710
You won't believe it,

390
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.480
but you will talk about things as if they're some jokes.

391
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.989
So tell myself to not worry about things too much.

392
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:17.819
I'll make difficult choices, and it will be hard for me.

393
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.690
After a year, a morning like today's will come too.

394
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.630
A morning like today's will come.

395
00:26:23.159 --> 00:26:24.630
Trust those days and survive.

396
00:26:25.299 --> 00:26:28.630
You told me to tell yourself that all your choices are right.

397
00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:32.600
How is it? Does it comfort you?

398
00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:29.860
Tell me. Were all of your choices really right?

399
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.500
What was a choice that you haven't regretted at all?

400
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.369
No regret at all?

401
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.940
That bus stop.

402
00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:42.339
Bus stop?

403
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.130
She can't be him. It was a boy.

404
00:28:08.299 --> 00:28:10.699
I'm sorry. I have to take the bus.
