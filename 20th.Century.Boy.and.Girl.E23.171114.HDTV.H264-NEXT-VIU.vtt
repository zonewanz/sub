(Kkong)

3
00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:22.746
Did you ever think Jin Jin was pretty?

4
00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:25.616
What are you talking about?

5
00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.187
I've known her since we were snotty kids.

6
00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:31.226
- You give it to her. - You give it to her.

7
00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:34.156
She'll like it more if you give it to her.

8
00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:37.596
The more she appreciates it, the more meaningful the gift will be.

9
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.626
Coffee, tea, cookies, and dessert.

10
00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:42.665
I guess this was your plan.

11
00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.365
Sa Jin Jin.

12
00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:55.346
I didn't get to go to the hospital.

13
00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:03.755
Yes, Ah Reum and Young Shim. We're the Four Bongos.

14
00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:05.385
We rode the same van.

15
00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:07.126
I see. I'm envious.

16
00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:19.236
Chul Min.

17
00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:24.206
Are you okay? What's wrong with you?

18
00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:26.845
- Let's go to a hospital. - I'm fine.

19
00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:29.875
You're not okay. You need to go to a hospital.

20
00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:34.115
What a nuisance.

21
00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:41.256
Why are you here?

22
00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:45.766
Why did you come here?

23
00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:54.576
Okay.

24
00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:57.036
Will you stay the night?

25
00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:19.356
You said you had a shoot.

26
00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:22.195
How did you get here?

27
00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.966
Why did you come all the way to Hong Kong?

28
00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:27.565
Ji Won.

29
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.935
I'm fine now that I saw you.

30
00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.346
Ji Won.

31
00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.615
Suffer all you want.

32
00:04:46.815 --> 00:04:48.685
Once you do that,

33
00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.026
you'll feel better.

34
00:04:53.086 --> 00:04:55.555
Next time, I'll pray for you that...

35
00:04:58.466 --> 00:05:00.695
it won't hurt as much.

36
00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:31.726
I ran over to see Chul Min...

37
00:05:32.695 --> 00:05:34.466
just like how he did for me once.

38
00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:37.096
But I wasn't able to...

39
00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:40.976
tell him to suffer all he wanted.

40
00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:44.205
I'm the one who made him suffer,

41
00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:47.005
and I was very aware of how he felt.

42
00:05:48.046 --> 00:05:49.216
But...

43
00:05:50.646 --> 00:05:52.385
I couldn't say the same thing to him.

44
00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:07.265

(Episode 23)

46
00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:19.505
I can't believe I'm eating breakfast.

47
00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:22.916
Please take your medicine afterwards.

48
00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:28.315
You're nagging too? You must be getting old.

49
00:06:28.315 --> 00:06:30.286
We aren't that many years apart.

50
00:06:30.286 --> 00:06:32.455
You should look after yourself too.

51
00:06:32.455 --> 00:06:35.026
Look at me. Just a little more work...

52
00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:36.695
was enough to make me sick.

53
00:06:36.695 --> 00:06:39.365
I guess having more work isn't always good.

54
00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:45.265
You should be the one taking tonics.

55
00:06:45.265 --> 00:06:48.705
- It's for you. - Just eat your food.

56
00:06:50.606 --> 00:06:53.705
You're living a decent life. You even have soup at home.

57
00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:57.885
It's from Jin Jin's mom.

58
00:06:58.245 --> 00:06:59.716
I met her while visiting your place,

59
00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:02.385
and she gave yours to me.

60
00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:08.995
That's great. You love ox bone soup.

61
00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.526
- Ji Won. - What?

62
00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.495
This ox bone soup...

63
00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:17.365
must be very special.

64
00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:19.406
I keep thinking of it.

65
00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:25.676
It felt as if it was warming me up from the inside.

66
00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:27.976
I kept wanting more.

67
00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.416
It was meant for you.

68
00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:34.245
I was eating what was yours.

69
00:07:35.986 --> 00:07:37.586
But it was so good.

70
00:07:40.555 --> 00:07:42.426
If I was able to...

71
00:07:43.825 --> 00:07:45.596
If I got the chance to do so,

72
00:07:46.926 --> 00:07:48.635
I wanted to have some more.

73
00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:56.135
Ji Won.

74
00:08:01.676 --> 00:08:02.976
I think...

75
00:08:04.515 --> 00:08:06.385
I need some time.

76
00:08:25.765 --> 00:08:29.276
(Intercom)

77
00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:30.836
Come have breakfast.

78
00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:33.945
I'm not hungry. I had breakfast.

79
00:08:33.945 --> 00:08:37.985
Did you? Mom cooked something special for you.

80
00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:42.855
Is he not going to come over?

81
00:08:43.116 --> 00:08:44.656
Put me on.

82
00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:49.195
Ji Won, why don't you want to come over?

83
00:08:49.756 --> 00:08:52.565
- Are you sick? - No, I'll come right up.

84
00:08:56.136 --> 00:08:59.435
One would think you're their son-in-law.

85
00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:03.435
- This is for you, Ji Won. - Thank you.

86
00:09:03.776 --> 00:09:05.975
She's so worried that...

87
00:09:05.975 --> 00:09:08.276
you look so thin and frail.

88
00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:11.286
- You shouldn't have to worry. - I know.

89
00:09:11.286 --> 00:09:14.185
I waste my time worrying about things.

90
00:09:14.185 --> 00:09:17.485
You look so cheery and bright today.

91
00:09:17.685 --> 00:09:21.225
Honey, don't you think Ji Won looks great today?

92
00:09:21.756 --> 00:09:23.055
Does he?

93
00:09:23.055 --> 00:09:25.065
Look at him carefully.

94
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:28.366
He looks as if someone ironed his face out.

95
00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:30.296
- Maybe. - Come on.

96
00:09:30.296 --> 00:09:32.735
Men are useless, both kids and adults.

97
00:09:32.735 --> 00:09:35.075
Their eyes are just accessories.

98
00:09:36.636 --> 00:09:37.746
Ji Won.

99
00:09:38.646 --> 00:09:41.075
Did something good happen?

100
00:09:45.146 --> 00:09:46.185
No.

101
00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:51.185
Has there been any changes...

102
00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:53.786
to yourself or your private life?

103
00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:56.325
No, no.

104
00:09:57.695 --> 00:10:02.195
Why? Is there still no one special in your life?

105
00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:05.366
No, no.

106
00:10:06.666 --> 00:10:09.676
What do you know? Let the adults talk.

107
00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:11.876
Why are you getting involved, then?

108
00:10:11.876 --> 00:10:15.276
- Min Ho, let's eat in peace. - It's always me.

109
00:10:15.776 --> 00:10:18.886
If I ever succeed, I won't be giving you a single penny.

110
00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:21.656
I don't want anything from you.

111
00:10:21.656 --> 00:10:24.626
- Please just succeed. - Mom.

112
00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:27.996
I'm a late bloomer. I'm biding my time.

113
00:10:27.996 --> 00:10:31.166
You never know when I'll hit big. Who knows what'll happen?

114
00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:32.526
I'm glad you said that.

115
00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:34.866
Did you hear that?

116
00:10:34.866 --> 00:10:38.036
Ji Won, you never know what'll happen.

117
00:10:38.036 --> 00:10:43.335
That's why you must cherish whatever relationship you have right now.

118
00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:49.715
Yes, you're right.

119
00:11:18.575 --> 00:11:19.805
Do you want me to take you to work?

120
00:11:20.676 --> 00:11:21.776
No.

121
00:11:22.546 --> 00:11:23.715
Why not?

122
00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.246
Come pick me up later.

123
00:11:26.315 --> 00:11:27.756
- Tonight? - Yes.

124
00:11:28.756 --> 00:11:29.955
What time?

125
00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:32.026
7pm?

126
00:11:32.026 --> 00:11:34.796
Then I'll be there until 6:50pm.

127
00:11:34.796 --> 00:11:37.095
No way. I can't keep you waiting.

128
00:11:38.896 --> 00:11:40.026
Okay.

129
00:11:46.235 --> 00:11:47.435
See you later.

130
00:11:47.435 --> 00:11:48.636
Okay. You should go.

131
00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:49.835
I want to see you leave.

132
00:11:50.335 --> 00:11:51.605
You should go first.

133
00:11:52.305 --> 00:11:53.906
Okay, bye.

134
00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:14.735
(Apartment 1401, Sa Jin Jin, Apartment 1301, Gong Ji Won)

135
00:12:19.235 --> 00:12:22.876
So Gong Ji Won is my dear Anthony's little brother.

136
00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.256
Make sure you keep your smile for the chief producer, okay?

137
00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:39.656
Okay.

138
00:12:39.656 --> 00:12:41.195
Don't just say that.

139
00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:43.896
You have such a nice smile. Why do you never smile for business?

140
00:12:45.296 --> 00:12:46.626
I got it.

141
00:12:47.695 --> 00:12:50.435
- You have to smile like that. - Fine.

142
00:12:52.506 --> 00:12:54.065
Hey, Anthony.

143
00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:55.876
Have you been well?

144
00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:01.445
It looked like you're happily married.

145
00:13:09.156 --> 00:13:10.886
You must be on your way to see the chief producer.

146
00:13:13.656 --> 00:13:15.195
He's been getting positive attention, right?

147
00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:16.756
Yes, thanks to you.

148
00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:18.526
Come on. I didn't do anything.

149
00:13:19.396 --> 00:13:21.565
- Are you going there for a meeting? - Yes.

150
00:13:21.565 --> 00:13:23.496
Is he jumping into a new project?

151
00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:29.935
Make sure you keep rowing while you still have the water.

152
00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:31.605
And be careful...

153
00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:34.176
not the see the water disappear as quickly as it came in.

154
00:13:35.075 --> 00:13:36.116
Oh, right.

155
00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:38.085
My article was the number one article on portal sites...

156
00:13:39.215 --> 00:13:41.555
thanks to Anthony a while ago. Did you see that?

157
00:13:44.016 --> 00:13:46.555
"Anthony's Job Is to Be Sa Jin Jin's Husband".

158
00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:48.926
I know that it was a bit too much.

159
00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:52.465
But what can I do? I need to make a living too.

160
00:13:59.335 --> 00:14:03.136
If it turns out okay, it's all good in the end.

161
00:14:03.136 --> 00:14:07.715
My article helped him get some attention too.

162
00:14:09.176 --> 00:14:10.315
Enjoy your time.

163
00:14:10.815 --> 00:14:13.685
When "We Got Married" is over, you'll be done being her husband.

164
00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.156
Oh, wait. I am supposed to get off on the fifth floor.

165
00:14:24.996 --> 00:14:26.296
The doors are closing.

166
00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:27.666
That darned jerk.

167
00:14:36.605 --> 00:14:38.945
Mom, I'm leaving.

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:41.616
- Jin Jin. - Yes?

169
00:14:41.616 --> 00:14:44.315
What's with the toner?

170
00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:47.185
Did you use something that was expired again?

171
00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:50.215
No, you gave me this not so long ago.

172
00:14:53.825 --> 00:14:56.796
This is cleansing oil. It removes your makeup.

173
00:14:57.825 --> 00:14:59.465
See? It says oil right here.

174
00:14:59.766 --> 00:15:01.565
Why would you use this?

175
00:15:03.396 --> 00:15:05.605
My gosh, my eyes are getting old,

176
00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:07.776
so I can't see that very well.

177
00:15:07.776 --> 00:15:10.335
Then you should be wearing reading glasses.

178
00:15:10.335 --> 00:15:11.605
Go wash your face.

179
00:15:12.176 --> 00:15:13.246
I'm leaving.

180
00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.616
Look at her temper.

181
00:15:21.656 --> 00:15:24.756
("Anthony, How Long Will You Stay Only as Old Ladies' Star?")

182
00:15:27.725 --> 00:15:28.896
What did he say this time?

183
00:15:29.896 --> 00:15:32.695
- Nothing. - I can find that myself too.

184
00:15:32.695 --> 00:15:33.825
So what did he say?

185
00:15:38.136 --> 00:15:39.305
"Anthony,"

186
00:15:40.366 --> 00:15:43.676
"How Long Will You Stay Only as Old Ladies' Star?"

187
00:15:47.815 --> 00:15:51.386
This is exactly why you shouldn't mess with Reporter Jeong.

188
00:15:51.585 --> 00:15:54.815
I almost suffocated to death in the elevator.

189
00:15:55.085 --> 00:15:57.985
Why does he hate you so much?

190
00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:00.926
If someone as patient as you reacted like that,

191
00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:03.926
that means he is a son of a dog.

192
00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:05.565
Forget it.

193
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:09.195
Calm down before you go. Aren't you meeting Yoon Hee's aunt?

194
00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:11.065
Please say hello to her.

195
00:16:11.866 --> 00:16:12.935
Okay.

196
00:16:13.366 --> 00:16:15.376
Yoon Hee's aunt is such a good woman.

197
00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:17.475
It's been ages since my brother passed away,

198
00:16:18.046 --> 00:16:20.746
but she thinks of Yoon Hee in every season,

199
00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:22.676
and she thinks of me too.

200
00:16:23.276 --> 00:16:24.445
Maybe that's why...

201
00:16:24.845 --> 00:16:27.786
I think of her first whenever the times are tough.

202
00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:29.985
- Is something tough for you? - Yes.

203
00:16:30.685 --> 00:16:32.225
Because you never listen to me.

204
00:16:32.786 --> 00:16:35.656
- I've always been like that. - I'm glad you know.

205
00:16:37.026 --> 00:16:38.595
Over there. Drop me off right there.

206
00:16:39.026 --> 00:16:40.126
Okay.

207
00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:43.496
The key money for office 201 is completely gone.

208
00:16:44.465 --> 00:16:46.435
We'll move out your stuff this weekend.

209
00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:48.235
Excuse me, sir.

210
00:16:50.435 --> 00:16:52.906
I mean, you can't just move out our stuff...

211
00:16:52.906 --> 00:16:55.246
I waited for a long time. I can't help you anymore.

212
00:16:55.575 --> 00:16:56.616
Oh, yes.

213
00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.715
Yes, I understand.

214
00:17:05.586 --> 00:17:06.755
Jeong Eun.

215
00:17:07.586 --> 00:17:08.955
Hey.

216
00:17:09.626 --> 00:17:11.566
- Have you been well? - Yes.

217
00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:16.435
I'm sorry, Jeong Eun.

218
00:17:17.166 --> 00:17:19.265
I don't have any money on me.

219
00:17:19.535 --> 00:17:21.505
I recently got a new job...

220
00:17:21.836 --> 00:17:23.535
because of mere 200 dollars of a raise per month.

221
00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:26.045
I'm so sorry.

222
00:17:27.445 --> 00:17:30.445
I understand. People don't really have cash on them these days.

223
00:17:31.485 --> 00:17:33.416
All of my money is invested in other places too.

224
00:17:34.886 --> 00:17:37.886
We'll get some money once Chul Min shoots a TV advertisement.

225
00:17:38.255 --> 00:17:41.126
I'm so glad. I hope his career takes off.

226
00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:43.455
I hope "We Got Married" becomes his big break.

227
00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:44.495
Yes.

228
00:17:45.195 --> 00:17:46.495
I'm sorry, Jeong Eun.

229
00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:48.596
Why are you sorry?

230
00:17:48.596 --> 00:17:50.935
This isn't why I brought this up.

231
00:17:51.435 --> 00:17:53.866
Hey, don't be sorry.

232

233

- Hey, look who this is. - Hello.

234
00:18:12.086 --> 00:18:13.955
What are the chances?

235
00:18:14.596 --> 00:18:15.896
That must've been fate.

236
00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:20.096
No, no. I usually meet a lot of people there.

237
00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:23.795
Anyway, while you're here, you can take those presents.

238
00:18:24.035 --> 00:18:25.336
We didn't know what to do with those.

239
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.775
Okay.

240
00:18:28.376 --> 00:18:29.475
Anyway.

241
00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.445
You have...

242
00:18:32.205 --> 00:18:33.545
a great office.

243
00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:36.545
We first began from a rooftop room too.

244
00:18:37.215 --> 00:18:40.386
We got to this point thanks to Jin Jin's hard work.

245
00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:44.656
Everything is great, but it's not very cost-effective.

246
00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:47.455
Do you know anyone who's looking to rent out an office?

247
00:18:48.356 --> 00:18:52.366
We paid a lot to expand this place, but it's very high-maintenance.

248
00:18:54.025 --> 00:18:58.106
We want someone who can pay just the maintenance fee, no rent.

249
00:18:58.606 --> 00:19:00.765
I can't seem to find anyone.

250
00:19:02.406 --> 00:19:05.176
It'd be great if it's someone in this industry.

251
00:19:05.876 --> 00:19:09.475
Do you know anyone, Ms. Choi?

252
00:19:12.916 --> 00:19:14.916
I'll look around, then.

253
00:19:15.185 --> 00:19:16.785
I'll return the favor...

254
00:19:17.116 --> 00:19:18.856
with a dish of special tuna gimbap.

255
00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:33.265
My husband got into an accident on a motorcycle delivery job.

256
00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:37.906
The insurance company says it's 100 percent his fault.

257
00:19:37.906 --> 00:19:40.806
It'll be difficult to change the ratio.

258
00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:43.515
However, since it happened on his job,

259
00:19:43.646 --> 00:19:46.886
I'll take a look and see if this can pass as an accident on duty.

260
00:19:47.816 --> 00:19:49.255
Yes, thank you.

261
00:19:50.616 --> 00:19:51.685
So...

262
00:19:52.755 --> 00:19:54.656
how much should I pay you?

263
00:19:55.626 --> 00:19:57.156
You can leave.

264
00:19:57.765 --> 00:19:59.025
There's no consultation fee.

265
00:19:59.926 --> 00:20:01.735
I'm so sorry.

266
00:20:01.735 --> 00:20:04.096
- It's all right. - Okay, then.

267
00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:06.566
Thank you so much.

268
00:20:10.136 --> 00:20:13.045

This is Loan Appraisal Department of Seoul Bank.

270
00:20:19.416 --> 00:20:21.816
Mr. Kang Kyung Seok wouldn't pick up his phone.

271
00:20:22.386 --> 00:20:24.386
Is he around?

272
00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:40.005
No.

273
00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:43.235
I can't let this happen. We need to live too.

(You Must Pay to Receive a Legal Advice.)

275
00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:04.056
Did you put up this poster?

276
00:21:04.195 --> 00:21:08.535
Oh, other offices put those up,

277
00:21:08.535 --> 00:21:10.896
so I figured it would be better...

278
00:21:10.896 --> 00:21:13.806
Did anyone ask you to do this?

279
00:21:32.626 --> 00:21:34.795
Do I need to help with your chores too?

280
00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:37.426
Gosh, I'm not asking for too much from you.

281
00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:41.035
You're dropping me off at the shop which happens to be on your way.

282

And I'm going to tell everyone that you're a really kind person.

283

Gosh, thanks a lot.

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.376

- All right. I'll call you later. - Bye.

291

My Jjin!

295
00:23:04.485 --> 00:23:06.715
I was wondering why you got so pretty.

296
00:23:06.816 --> 00:23:09.015
It's not like that. It's not.

297
00:23:09.015 --> 00:23:10.556
I know I'm right.

298

I didn't know President Gong could sound so cute.

299
00:23:13.455 --> 00:23:16.995
He was like, "Jjin. Jjin. Jjin!"

300

Jin Jin, have you guys kissed yet?

00:23:21.465 --> 00:23:23.535
Please stop it. Stop.

302

If you tell me, I won't bring this up again.

All right. Go. It's not going to happen.

I feel so sorry for Anthony.

305
00:23:31.806 --> 00:23:34.376
I like Anthony a tiny bit better.

306
00:23:34.376 --> 00:23:36.316
Gosh, he'd be so hurt.

307
00:23:36.316 --> 00:23:39.285
Why would he be hurt because of an unimportant person like me?

308
00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:40.985
You're not unimportant.

309
00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:43.255
Everyone is in front of him.

310
00:23:44.685 --> 00:23:46.886
- Gosh. - You should go.

311
00:23:46.886 --> 00:23:48.126

All right.

(- Let's go on a date tomorrow. - Tomorrow? All right.)

316

Yes?

317
00:24:35.576 --> 00:24:38.275
- Did you just get here? - Yes.

318
00:24:40.005 --> 00:24:42.076
Young Shim and Ah Reum are already there.

319
00:24:42.275 --> 00:24:44.715
Should we go in separately?

320
00:24:45.045 --> 00:24:47.015
It's just them.

321
00:24:48.015 --> 00:24:51.126
But they don't know yet.

322
00:24:52.455 --> 00:24:55.556
How do you think they'll react when they find out?

323
00:24:57.455 --> 00:24:58.566

- Sa Jin Jin! - Gong Ji Won!

- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

327
00:25:06.906 --> 00:25:09.475
- Did you expect us to say that? - We knew it already.

328
00:25:10.176 --> 00:25:11.275
How?

329
00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:15.245
It wasn't me.

330

- We don't need you to tell us. - No.

331
00:25:19.215 --> 00:25:21.785
- We can practically hear it. - Yes.

332
00:25:21.886 --> 00:25:24.926
But don't you think this is getting too serious even for playing house?

333
00:25:24.926 --> 00:25:28.596
We'll have to wait and see to find out if they're playing house.

334
00:25:31.366 --> 00:25:32.795
Are you going to get married?

335
00:25:36.735 --> 00:25:39.235
What are you saying? We said we weren't getting married.

336
00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:43.935
But we didn't carve that as a part of...

337
00:25:43.935 --> 00:25:46.906
the Code of Hammurabi or something.

338
00:25:47.406 --> 00:25:52.215
Well... There could be exceptions.

339
00:25:52.215 --> 00:25:55.886
And when the occasion demands, we could make it flexible.

340
00:25:55.886 --> 00:25:57.116
It's how it goes.

341
00:25:57.116 --> 00:25:58.126
- What? - What?

342
00:25:58.326 --> 00:26:00.626
I mean... I'm just saying.

343
00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:04.096
What's your deal?

344
00:26:05.765 --> 00:26:07.495
What's your deal, Han Ah Reum?

345
00:26:10.066 --> 00:26:12.306
Hey, so the thing is...

346
00:26:12.935 --> 00:26:14.475
What do you think...

347
00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:16.935
of Jung Woo Sung?

348
00:26:16.935 --> 00:26:18.106
- Jung Woo Sung? - Jung Woo Sung?

349
00:26:19.406 --> 00:26:21.945
Do you think you can kiss him?

350
00:26:21.945 --> 00:26:24.346
You said you realized within a second that he's not your type.

351
00:26:24.346 --> 00:26:25.785
I did then.

352
00:26:26.745 --> 00:26:29.785
Oh gosh, I can't take my eyes off of her lips.

353
00:26:30.285 --> 00:26:31.856
Are you going out with him?

354
00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:35.326
Well, it's not like I'm dating him but...

355
00:26:35.626 --> 00:26:36.826
Wait a moment.

356
00:26:38.566 --> 00:26:40.626
- This is unbelievable. - Gosh.

357
00:26:40.995 --> 00:26:43.965
Reum, it's our first date tomorrow.

358
00:26:44.166 --> 00:26:47.636
Don't drink too much, all right? Go easy on yourself.

359
00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:51.005
(Jung Woo Sung)

360
00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:53.676
I want to eat pork belly,

361
00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:56.316
shoulder, neck, and cheek meat.

362
00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:01.785
I'm going on my first date with him tomorrow.

363
00:27:01.785 --> 00:27:03.586
- Gosh! - Oh, my!

364
00:27:05.525 --> 00:27:08.495
- Gosh, congratulations. - Let's have a drink.

365
00:27:08.495 --> 00:27:11.295
- Congratulations. - Cheers.

366
00:27:11.295 --> 00:27:12.866
Oh, my!

367
00:27:19.235 --> 00:27:20.735
What's wrong?

368
00:27:21.505 --> 00:27:23.676
It's just...

369
00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:26.176
a little awkward.

370
00:27:26.505 --> 00:27:28.445
Aren't you?

371
00:27:29.715 --> 00:27:30.846
A little.

372
00:27:31.586 --> 00:27:33.685
Gosh, I can't stay here any longer.

373
00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:36.485
Let's meet again when we're ready to see you like that.

374
00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:40.255
- Good luck on your first date. - Thanks.

375
00:27:40.386 --> 00:27:42.695
You guys have a good time.

376
00:27:42.695 --> 00:27:46.166
- Oh my goodness! - Oh my goodness!

377
00:27:46.495 --> 00:27:48.096
Gosh.

378
00:27:49.636 --> 00:27:50.866
- Shall we go? - Yes.

379
00:28:24.895 --> 00:28:26.995
(Episode 24 will air shortly.)
