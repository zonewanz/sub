(Episode 23)

4
00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:20.426
Ji An.

5
00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:40.946
Seo Ji An.

6
00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:47.916
Ji An.

7
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.796
Let's talk.

8
00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.605
Right there. I'll get off here.

9
00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:16.245
Please wait here.

10
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.666
There he is.

11
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.690

12
00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:50.416
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:51.816 --> 00:01:53.816
I said I'm working.

14
00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:56.086
How can you work here?

15
00:01:56.086 --> 00:01:57.456
I like it here.

16
00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.226
I'm here because I like it.

17
00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:01.896
Why do you like it here?

18
00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:03.525
It's nice,

19
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.866
so just forget about me and leave.

20
00:02:07.396 --> 00:02:09.036
You told me to wait for a week.

21
00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:12.765
Will you wait for a week?

22
00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:17.145
It's been more than a week.

23
00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:18.976
I thought...

24
00:02:20.976 --> 00:02:23.446
you'd keep your promise this time.

25
00:02:23.985 --> 00:02:27.055
So even after you disappeared,

26
00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:29.656
I still waited.

27
00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:33.925
You meant it when you said you'll tell me in a week.

28
00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:36.656
Did I?

29
00:02:41.436 --> 00:02:42.996
Maybe you're right.

30
00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:46.936
Why didn't you call me and become like this?

31
00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:50.175
What's wrong with this?

32
00:02:50.346 --> 00:02:51.476
Ji An.

33
00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:54.346
I can't even say...

34
00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:56.376
that I'm sorry for not keeping my promise.

35
00:02:56.816 --> 00:02:58.585
I'm not going to keep that promise.

36
00:02:59.816 --> 00:03:00.885
What?

37
00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:04.226
You should go. I don't have anything else to say.

38
00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:08.496
Look at you.

39
00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:10.596
How could you ask me to just leave you?

40
00:03:10.895 --> 00:03:12.066
Ms. Seo!

41
00:03:12.526 --> 00:03:14.335
What are you doing over there?

42
00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:15.696
You should be working.

43
00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.365
All of the laver is going to dry up.

44
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.865
You deserted your station.

45
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.006
How dare you play hooky?

46
00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:23.645
I'm coming.

47
00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:26.346
I must go back to work.

48
00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:34.916
Sorry.

49
00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:46.166
To whom is he talking to?

50
00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:49.436
We were supposed to have a meal together today.

51
00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:22.295
Hey, you should take her home.

52
00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:23.605
He got her by the collar.

53
00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:25.735
What do you mean?

54
00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:28.375
Mr. Bong is obsessed with money.

55
00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:30.476
He's making her work like a slave...

56
00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:31.945
after making her indebted to him.

57
00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:33.516
I'm not following you.

58
00:04:33.516 --> 00:04:36.245
He saved her when she tried to commit suicide.

59
00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:37.615
She tried to commit suicide?

60
00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:39.216
He paid for her hospital bills.

61
00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:41.716
He charges her 7 dollars for meals, 5 for snacks,

62
00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:43.985
and 50 dollars for her room.

63
00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:46.255
She owes him more money than she can pay back.

64
00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:48.096
My goodness.

65
00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:04.945
Sir.

66
00:05:09.615 --> 00:05:10.815
How do you do?

67
00:05:11.216 --> 00:05:13.755
I'm a friend of Ms. Seo.

68
00:05:14.255 --> 00:05:16.156
So what? What do you want?

69
00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:20.456
She's working here because she owes you money.

70
00:05:20.456 --> 00:05:21.555
How much is her debt?

71
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.365
Why do you want to know? Will you pay it back?

72
00:05:25.565 --> 00:05:27.896
If you could tell me how it happened to begin with.

73
00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:30.266
If I do explain it,

74
00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:32.536
are you going to pay back the money?

75
00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:34.935
I will pay you back every cent and take her home.

76
00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:38.675
Is it true that she tried to commit suicide?

77
00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:39.745
Where was she?

78
00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:54.795
Every morning,

79
00:05:55.425 --> 00:05:57.365
I hike the mountain over there.

80
00:05:57.966 --> 00:05:59.495
I go there when the sun rises,

81
00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:00.865
pay my respects,

82
00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:02.536
and dig out a few wild ginsengs...

83
00:06:02.536 --> 00:06:03.865
which I've planted before.

84
00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:06.766
That's where I found her.

85
00:06:07.206 --> 00:06:08.536
In the mountain?

86
00:06:08.706 --> 00:06:12.045
She wouldn't have gone to that mountain...

87
00:06:12.675 --> 00:06:15.276
unless she was determined to commit suicide.

88
00:06:15.945 --> 00:06:17.185
That's the mountain.

89
00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:26.685
Miss.

90
00:06:35.235 --> 00:06:38.065
She also seemed odd when I saw her during the day.

91
00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:44.706
Nobody...

92
00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:48.016
can be that happy all alone.

93
00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:49.776
No way.

94
00:06:50.646 --> 00:06:51.886
Ji An...

95
00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:54.216
tried to kill herself.

96
00:06:55.386 --> 00:06:58.185
When I hiked down with her on my back,

97
00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:00.456
do you know how scared I was?

98
00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:02.555
I was afraid she might die on my back.

99
00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:04.365
Until I met the Rescue Squad,

100
00:07:04.365 --> 00:07:06.125
I didn't even take a break...

101
00:07:06.666 --> 00:07:09.336
while hiking down that bumpy trail.

102
00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:16.536
My gosh, she's alive. She's awake.

103
00:07:19.576 --> 00:07:21.545
She woke up after her stomach was pumped.

104
00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:26.146
But she wouldn't tell me her name.

105
00:07:27.286 --> 00:07:29.416
When I told her that I was going to call the police,

106
00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:32.026
she begged me...

107
00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:33.956
not to call the police.

108
00:07:41.536 --> 00:07:42.896
Are you done eating?

109
00:07:43.706 --> 00:07:44.865
Yes.

110
00:07:45.235 --> 00:07:47.476
Then pay back 700 dollars for the hospital bills,

111
00:07:47.476 --> 00:07:49.235
and leave this house now.

112
00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:53.076
I don't...

113
00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:55.315
have any money.

114
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.675
You don't have money?

115
00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:59.545
Call your family or anyone you know.

116
00:08:08.695 --> 00:08:10.295
If you don't have 700 dollars,

117
00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:12.266
work on the field to pay back my money.

118
00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.735
You can't leave this town...

119
00:08:14.735 --> 00:08:17.266
without paying back the money you owe me.

120
00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:22.276
I purposely stopped her from leaving .

121
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:24.245
I thought if I let her go,

122
00:08:24.245 --> 00:08:25.375
she would try that again.

123
00:08:37.555 --> 00:08:40.955
But she did everything I told her to do.

124
00:08:41.626 --> 00:08:43.295
That scared me.

125
00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:49.536
I even made sure...

126
00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:52.205
she and my wife slept in the same room.

127
00:08:52.805 --> 00:08:54.475
I was afraid she would run away at night.

128
00:08:56.876 --> 00:08:58.445
I kept giving her work...

129
00:08:58.445 --> 00:09:00.215
so she wouldn't have time to think about suicide,

130
00:09:00.215 --> 00:09:03.146
but she managed to do all the work I gave her.

131
00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:04.786
She wouldn't even complain about being tired.

132
00:09:04.786 --> 00:09:06.116
She didn't say a word.

133
00:09:07.116 --> 00:09:08.386
Why do you think...

134
00:09:08.786 --> 00:09:11.225
my friend is going to commit suicide again?

135
00:09:12.225 --> 00:09:14.396
Didn't you see her?

136
00:09:15.496 --> 00:09:18.565
Her eyes look lifeless.

137
00:09:37.715 --> 00:09:39.746
Those aren't the eyes of the living.

138
00:09:40.616 --> 00:09:42.786
I don't know what she had to go through.

139
00:09:43.386 --> 00:09:45.055
It's been days,

140
00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:49.195
but her eyes are still dead.

141
00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:55.166
This was more than what I bargained for.

142
00:09:55.835 --> 00:09:57.366
I'm glad you're here.

143
00:09:57.366 --> 00:09:58.866
Please take her home.

144
00:10:00.065 --> 00:10:01.175
You think...

145
00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:04.345
she might try to kill herself again?

146
00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.746
I don't know if she lacks the will...

147
00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:09.646
or the energy to live her life.

148
00:10:10.646 --> 00:10:12.185
If you don't trust me,

149
00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:14.016
watch her for a day.

150
00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:17.356
You'll understand what I mean.

151
00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:28.065
I even looked into where she used to be an intern,

152
00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:30.666
but no one knows her whereabouts.

153
00:10:31.065 --> 00:10:33.236
It's like she dropped from the face of the earth.

154
00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:35.205
Are they keeping watch on her house?

155
00:10:35.776 --> 00:10:37.345
What if they missed her when she returned?

156
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.975
I don't know since I'm not on watch,

157
00:10:40.276 --> 00:10:42.516
but the report says that she hasn't returned.

158
00:10:43.986 --> 00:10:45.945
Then where could she possibly be?

159
00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.756
Maybe she's just resting somewhere?

160
00:10:48.756 --> 00:10:50.526
Even if that's the case, I should know...

161
00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:52.955
where she is and if she really is resting.

162
00:10:53.256 --> 00:10:54.925
Why should you?

163
00:10:56.695 --> 00:10:59.095
Don't you think you're overdoing it?

164
00:10:59.595 --> 00:11:00.866
She's an adult.

165
00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:04.166
I mean, if that happened to me,

166
00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:05.606
I would take more than a month.

167
00:11:05.606 --> 00:11:07.776
I'd want to go into hiding for even six months.

168
00:11:07.776 --> 00:11:09.435
That's why I must find her.

169
00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.506
Pardon?

170
00:11:12.376 --> 00:11:13.575
That's why...

171
00:11:14.445 --> 00:11:15.715
I must find her.

172
00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:17.646
Regardless of her whereabouts,

173
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:19.815
shouldn't you just stay out of it?

174
00:11:22.315 --> 00:11:25.656
I'm risking my job to say this, you know.

175
00:11:27.126 --> 00:11:28.795
She would probably contact her family, right?

176
00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:31.195
Should I ask her parents?

177
00:11:40.205 --> 00:11:41.205
- Excuse me. - Sorry?

178
00:11:41.205 --> 00:11:44.045
Have you seen this girl buying a ticket?

179
00:11:44.045 --> 00:11:46.175
I'm sorry. I don't remember her face.

180
00:11:46.175 --> 00:11:47.815
- I'm sorry again. - Okay.

181
00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:49.075
Next customer, please.

182
00:12:07.036 --> 00:12:08.595
Excuse me.

183
00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:11.636
Have you seen this girl here?

184
00:12:11.766 --> 00:12:14.435
We have a lot of travelers coming in and out of here.

185
00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:15.906
You wouldn't be able to find her like this.

186
00:12:15.906 --> 00:12:18.746
Then where can I look at the surveillance footages?

187
00:12:18.746 --> 00:12:20.616
We can't show the footages to just anyone...

188
00:12:20.616 --> 00:12:22.045
unless you are with the police.

189
00:12:22.045 --> 00:12:23.345
So let me ask again.

190
00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:25.746
Where can I look at the camera footages?

191
00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:27.116
We can't show them to you. I'm sorry.

192
00:12:27.116 --> 00:12:28.815
Hold on, please. I just...

193
00:12:28.815 --> 00:12:30.325
My gosh.

194
00:12:40.565 --> 00:12:42.166
Excuse me.

195
00:13:26.075 --> 00:13:30.445
First, call Ryu's wife to record the blackmailing.

196
00:13:32.585 --> 00:13:33.616
(Ryu's wife)

197
00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:35.986
Is the money ready?

198
00:13:37.286 --> 00:13:39.286
That's not it.

199
00:13:39.925 --> 00:13:41.425
About the money...

200
00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:44.225
I only got 600,000 dollars.

201
00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:46.725
Can't you just take that?

202
00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:48.795
Stop talking nonsense.

203
00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.736
I can't get any more money.

204
00:13:53.335 --> 00:13:55.805
I am going to leak the photos then.

205
00:13:55.805 --> 00:13:57.575
No, please don't.

206
00:14:00.646 --> 00:14:02.776
Then please wait a little.

207
00:14:03.986 --> 00:14:05.616
I will sell my other cello.

208
00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:08.585
I will be in big trouble if I sell this too.

209
00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:12.756
You have to keep the promise though.

210
00:14:12.756 --> 00:14:14.455
You can't blackmail me again.

211
00:14:14.955 --> 00:14:17.565
The amount went from 100,000 to 700,000.

212
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.095
If you ask for more,

213
00:14:19.465 --> 00:14:22.536
I will either tell my parents or the police.

214
00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:25.636
I am not that evil, you know?

215
00:14:27.175 --> 00:14:28.305
All right.

216
00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:30.776
I will call you when I get 700,000 dollars.

217
00:14:31.445 --> 00:14:33.376
Don't be late.

218
00:14:36.075 --> 00:14:37.116
(Stop recording)

219
00:14:40.016 --> 00:14:41.585
That was so nerve-racking.

220
00:14:47.026 --> 00:14:48.126
Second,

221
00:14:48.156 --> 00:14:51.295
naturally fire Ryu Jae Shin.

222
00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:54.095
Ms. Min.

223
00:14:56.835 --> 00:14:58.406
About Driver Ryu.

224
00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:01.776
He's married. Why didn't you tell me?

225
00:15:02.236 --> 00:15:03.746
I told you.

226
00:15:04.045 --> 00:15:06.506
I told you when I was explaining about him.

227
00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:08.916
No way. You only told me his name.

228
00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:10.916
Miss,

229
00:15:11.315 --> 00:15:13.345
do you know why I am not married?

230
00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:14.815
How would I know that?

231
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:18.526
Do you know where I go on my day off every month?

232
00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.996
How would I know when you wouldn't tell me?

233
00:15:20.996 --> 00:15:22.396
I told you more than three times...

234
00:15:22.396 --> 00:15:24.266
that I visit my father at the hospital...

235
00:15:24.266 --> 00:15:25.565
because you asked.

236
00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:28.335
Did I?

237
00:15:28.935 --> 00:15:31.506
You don't remember things you're not interested in.

238
00:15:32.606 --> 00:15:35.475
I am not supposed to be interested in your life.

239
00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:36.945
I know that.

240
00:15:36.945 --> 00:15:41.315
By the way, what's wrong with him being married?

241
00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.746
Well...

242
00:15:43.445 --> 00:15:44.616
That's not the problem.

243
00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:48.116
I don't care if he's married or not.

244
00:15:48.116 --> 00:15:50.185
Do you not like him?

245
00:15:50.185 --> 00:15:51.325
I don't.

246
00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.455
You want to change your driver, right?

247
00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:54.925
That's it.

248
00:15:55.026 --> 00:15:57.626
Ryu is... I mean, Mr. Ryu is...

249
00:15:57.626 --> 00:15:59.126
I will come up with...

250
00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:03.036
the reason for firing him and tell your mother.

251
00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:04.406
Really?

252
00:16:04.906 --> 00:16:06.305
What will you say?

253
00:16:06.305 --> 00:16:08.876
Whatever I say, he won't...

254
00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:10.545
have any right to file a complaint, right?

255
00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:11.805
Of course not.

256
00:16:17.246 --> 00:16:18.345
Yes?

257
00:16:18.585 --> 00:16:21.215
I did the two things you told me to do. And you?

258
00:16:21.756 --> 00:16:23.156
Are you all ready?

259
00:16:23.486 --> 00:16:24.986
Yes, I'm ready.

260
00:16:25.085 --> 00:16:27.026
Really? Let's meet then.

261
00:16:27.126 --> 00:16:28.996
I need to know how it's going.

262
00:16:29.725 --> 00:16:30.795
I can't meet you today.

263
00:16:30.965 --> 00:16:33.595
I have something important to do.

264
00:16:33.695 --> 00:16:36.866
What? What's more important than this?

265
00:16:36.935 --> 00:16:38.305
My goodness.

266
00:16:38.606 --> 00:16:42.335
Did you forget that my sister's there?

267
00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:44.475
Right.

268
00:16:46.075 --> 00:16:48.475
I will choose the day and call you.

269
00:16:50.616 --> 00:16:52.616
It will be a problem if this doesn't work out.

270
00:16:53.116 --> 00:16:54.516
Can I trust him?

271
00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.626
Here's your food.

272
00:17:01.425 --> 00:17:03.626
We serve everything on a tray...

273
00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:05.126
so even children can eat it comfortably.

274
00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:06.826
- Please enjoy. - Okay.

275
00:17:07.296 --> 00:17:09.965
You love salad, don't you, sweetie?

276
00:17:10.535 --> 00:17:12.765
You can eat as much rice and salad you want.

277
00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.235
You can tell me anytime if you want a refill.

278
00:17:22.245 --> 00:17:23.316
Ji Ho.

279
00:17:24.616 --> 00:17:26.416
What are you doing here?

280
00:17:26.616 --> 00:17:27.715
We need to talk.

281
00:17:28.316 --> 00:17:29.515
It won't take long.

282
00:17:34.096 --> 00:17:36.225
Sit here. Sit over here.

283
00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:40.265
How did you find out about this place?

284
00:17:40.866 --> 00:17:42.035
I heard from Hae Ja...

285
00:17:42.735 --> 00:17:45.265
Never mind that. I will get straight to the point.

286
00:17:48.675 --> 00:17:49.806
This is a nice place.

287
00:17:50.275 --> 00:17:53.715
Seeing this place makes me feel less sorry to you.

288
00:17:54.546 --> 00:17:56.275
What are you talking about?

289
00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:57.416
I am not going to college.

290
00:17:58.116 --> 00:17:59.745
I already told Ji Tae and Dad.

291
00:17:59.846 --> 00:18:00.985
You're not going to college?

292
00:18:01.816 --> 00:18:03.856
Ji Ho, what are you talking about?

293
00:18:04.356 --> 00:18:06.156
The entrance exam is just a few days away.

294
00:18:06.156 --> 00:18:08.896
I haven't been studying. I've been working.

295
00:18:09.225 --> 00:18:10.765
I wanted to make money like you.

296
00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:12.326
What?

297
00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:14.096
You haven't been studying?

298
00:18:15.465 --> 00:18:17.465
- Have you been lying? - Why not?

299
00:18:18.205 --> 00:18:19.666
You can lie,

300
00:18:20.505 --> 00:18:21.606
and I can't?

301
00:18:25.546 --> 00:18:28.245
Ji Ho. I have...

302
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.685
disappointed you, haven't I?

303
00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:34.215
It's my fault.

304
00:18:35.586 --> 00:18:39.126
It's all my fault. But how can you not go to college?

305
00:18:39.126 --> 00:18:40.725
It's always about college.

306
00:18:41.396 --> 00:18:43.326
To send me to college when I don't even want to,

307
00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:45.525
you took money from Ji Tae and put pressure on Ji An.

308
00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:48.636
You switched Ji An and Ji Soo to get this.

309
00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:52.435
This all happened because of your greed.

310
00:18:54.306 --> 00:18:56.406
We could've just lived with what we can afford.

311
00:18:56.975 --> 00:18:59.705
If you let me give up when I first failed,

312
00:19:00.445 --> 00:19:02.245
I wouldn't have lied to you.

313
00:19:02.416 --> 00:19:03.886
And perhaps Ji An...

314
00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:06.185
would've felt less pressured...

315
00:19:06.685 --> 00:19:10.556
and taken a decent job at a smaller company.

316
00:19:11.285 --> 00:19:13.285
If only she knew I was making money.

317
00:19:14.856 --> 00:19:16.255
Why don't any of you...

318
00:19:17.465 --> 00:19:19.725
understand how I feel?

319
00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:22.796
You created this mess. How could we understand you?

320
00:19:23.336 --> 00:19:26.406
You only feel greed.

321
00:19:31.306 --> 00:19:32.675
When I saw you a moment ago,

322
00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:35.546
you looked happy to work here.

323
00:19:36.745 --> 00:19:38.386
I must've gotten it from you.

324
00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:41.656
You should continue to work with a smile.

325
00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:43.626
And stop making a fuss...

326
00:19:43.826 --> 00:19:45.925
about your son making money.

327
00:19:48.826 --> 00:19:51.195
I am not working here to make money now.

328
00:19:52.396 --> 00:19:53.566
I had no choice...

329
00:19:53.566 --> 00:19:55.195
- I'm leaving. - Ji Ho.

330
00:19:58.005 --> 00:19:59.066
I...

331
00:20:00.066 --> 00:20:01.406
won't be going home for a while.

332
00:20:02.306 --> 00:20:03.606
I can't see your face.

333
00:20:05.146 --> 00:20:07.515
That's why I couldn't come as soon as I heard this.

334
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:10.685
You lied...

335
00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:13.556
to Dad and made this mess all alone.

336
00:20:14.156 --> 00:20:15.755
You deceived all of us...

337
00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:18.285
and ruined both Ji An and Ji Soo's lives.

338
00:20:34.606 --> 00:20:36.675
What should I do?

339
00:20:54.596 --> 00:20:58.126
(Ji Soo)

340
00:21:09.675 --> 00:21:11.646
Thank you. Please come again.

341
00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:21.785
You seriously lack professionalism.

342
00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:24.886
You don't even greet your customer.

343
00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:28.425
If you close your shop, you'll lose the business.

344
00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:30.225
I won't sell coffee to you.

345
00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:34.396
One cafe latte.

346
00:22:14.076 --> 00:22:17.606
Ta-da. I'm done.

347
00:22:21.416 --> 00:22:25.285
I can't do it because my hands are too big.

348
00:22:26.386 --> 00:22:28.015
Perhaps you don't love me enough.

349
00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:31.985
My friend's boyfriend made a jar of 1,000 cranes.

350
00:22:33.326 --> 00:22:34.556
By the way,

351
00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:37.195
do I really have to fold 1,000 cranes?

352
00:22:38.225 --> 00:22:41.066
A thousand cranes make your wish come true.

353
00:22:42.066 --> 00:22:44.066
But this is too small.

354
00:22:44.906 --> 00:22:47.306
Can't you use a bigger paper?

355
00:22:48.175 --> 00:22:51.005
Then, 1,000 cranes won't fit in a jar.

356
00:22:51.275 --> 00:22:53.076
But you can get a big jar.

357
00:22:53.076 --> 00:22:54.215
A jar this big.

358
00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:57.886
Where can you find a jar like that?

359
00:22:58.316 --> 00:23:00.356
How big do you want your crane to be?

360
00:23:07.826 --> 00:23:10.425
I'm hungry. Let me get some bread.

361
00:23:11.465 --> 00:23:12.896
Mr. Kang.

362
00:23:13.066 --> 00:23:14.535
I'm listening.

363
00:23:14.535 --> 00:23:16.695
I think you're mistaken.

364
00:23:17.306 --> 00:23:19.606
Yes. I am divorced.

365
00:23:19.606 --> 00:23:21.235
I got divorced five years ago.

366
00:23:21.636 --> 00:23:24.906
But my divorce didn't have anything to do with you.

367
00:23:24.906 --> 00:23:27.116
I forgot about you when I got married.

368
00:23:29.245 --> 00:23:31.586
You know me, don't you?

369
00:23:32.546 --> 00:23:33.715
I married another man...

370
00:23:33.715 --> 00:23:35.685
because I can forget you.

371
00:23:35.886 --> 00:23:37.525
And I forgot about you when I got married.

372
00:23:41.925 --> 00:23:43.356
Can't you hear me?

373
00:23:44.765 --> 00:23:46.866
My ears are open. Of course I hear you.

374
00:23:48.695 --> 00:23:50.765
That won't change anything.

375
00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:52.435
Just because I'm divorced...

376
00:23:52.435 --> 00:23:54.205
and just because I'm unfortunate...

377
00:23:54.606 --> 00:23:56.975
doesn't mean I didn't forget about you.

378
00:23:57.306 --> 00:23:58.606
You're mistaken.

379
00:24:01.316 --> 00:24:02.445
Really?

380
00:24:03.116 --> 00:24:04.185
Really.

381
00:24:08.455 --> 00:24:10.056
What are you doing?

382
00:24:10.156 --> 00:24:12.556
You still can't lie,

383
00:24:12.556 --> 00:24:13.656
can you?

384
00:24:16.255 --> 00:24:17.995
Hey, Nam Goo!

385
00:24:18.425 --> 00:24:20.495
You got customers.

386
00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:26.005
I will tell you this.

387
00:24:26.566 --> 00:24:28.435
You are mistaken.

388
00:24:29.806 --> 00:24:31.275
Don't you dare come back.

389
00:24:40.416 --> 00:24:41.685
Enjoy.

390
00:25:07.116 --> 00:25:08.175
Hello, Mr. Baker.

391
00:25:08.175 --> 00:25:10.146
Why did you take the cab?

392
00:25:10.346 --> 00:25:11.515
Why did you bring that yourself?

393
00:25:11.515 --> 00:25:14.116
I need milk. Come in first.

394
00:25:14.116 --> 00:25:15.185
Okay.

395
00:25:22.225 --> 00:25:24.366
He said something urgent came up.

396
00:25:24.366 --> 00:25:26.025
And he hurriedly left.

397
00:25:27.066 --> 00:25:28.796
Did he not tell you what it was about?

398
00:25:28.866 --> 00:25:31.606
He didn't. I saw him when I went to get the salt.

399
00:25:31.606 --> 00:25:33.136
He was with someone.

400
00:25:33.876 --> 00:25:34.935
Who?

401
00:25:34.935 --> 00:25:36.475
I don't know.

402
00:25:36.606 --> 00:25:39.646
How can he be so rude?

403
00:25:39.906 --> 00:25:41.245
Even if it was really urgent,

404
00:25:41.245 --> 00:25:43.245
how can he just leave you on the street?

405
00:25:43.245 --> 00:25:44.985
It must've been...

406
00:25:44.985 --> 00:25:46.485
a very urgent business.

407
00:25:46.485 --> 00:25:48.515
Salt is an urgent business for me too.

408
00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:51.126
That's why I brought one sack.

409
00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:56.326
He should've called me.

410
00:25:57.296 --> 00:25:58.396
(Mr. Sunwoo)

411
00:26:04.005 --> 00:26:05.765
He's not answering.

412
00:26:06.336 --> 00:26:09.106
He must've found his lost family member.

413
00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:12.005
There were only old ladies working there.

414
00:26:12.906 --> 00:26:15.046
Did he perhaps lose his mother?

415
00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:16.576
No.

416
00:26:17.485 --> 00:26:19.616
How would you know that?

417
00:26:21.356 --> 00:26:24.126
My goodness. What a shame.

418
00:26:24.126 --> 00:26:25.485
I wanted you to get some fresh air,

419
00:26:25.485 --> 00:26:27.096
and you ended up feeling worse.

420
00:26:27.425 --> 00:26:29.796
Did you send me so I could get fresh air?

421
00:26:29.796 --> 00:26:32.225
As if a stone was on your chest,

422
00:26:32.396 --> 00:26:34.995
you were sighing so deeply.

423
00:26:35.396 --> 00:26:38.265
Right. I did that.

424
00:26:40.035 --> 00:26:42.376
What happened to Eun Seok?

425
00:26:45.576 --> 00:26:47.175
What are you talking about?

426
00:26:48.116 --> 00:26:49.275
Myung Hee,

427
00:26:49.445 --> 00:26:51.646
my husband is the CEO of Haesung Apparel.

428
00:26:52.116 --> 00:26:54.015
I heard Eun Seok resigned.

429
00:26:55.056 --> 00:26:57.586
He must have nothing to do.

430
00:26:57.626 --> 00:26:59.785
How can he hear the news...

431
00:26:59.955 --> 00:27:01.255
about an employee so fast?

432
00:27:01.525 --> 00:27:02.826
She's our niece.

433
00:27:03.566 --> 00:27:05.326
He went to find her on the last day of the event,

434
00:27:05.326 --> 00:27:06.495
and he couldn't find her.

435
00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:08.435
So how can I not ask?

436
00:27:10.035 --> 00:27:11.306
She collapsed from overworking.

437
00:27:11.306 --> 00:27:12.566
So I sent her on a vacation.

438
00:27:13.606 --> 00:27:14.675
Overworking?

439
00:27:15.505 --> 00:27:17.245
But the event was her everything.

440
00:27:19.376 --> 00:27:21.515
She's not seriously ill, is she?

441
00:27:21.715 --> 00:27:23.586
Do you want her to be seriously ill?

442
00:27:25.886 --> 00:27:27.356
Where did you send her?

443
00:27:28.185 --> 00:27:30.116
Somewhere where you can never find her.

444
00:27:30.755 --> 00:27:33.425
So don't even think about looking for her.

445
00:27:33.955 --> 00:27:36.255
What would I do if I find her?

446
00:27:39.995 --> 00:27:41.666
Couldn't you just make a call?

447
00:27:42.166 --> 00:27:44.005
Are you good enough to find out something...

448
00:27:44.235 --> 00:27:46.406
if you see my face?

449
00:27:48.205 --> 00:27:49.775
Until when will she take time off?

450
00:27:53.146 --> 00:27:55.175
Until the foundation anniversary.

451
00:27:56.376 --> 00:27:57.745
You're done, aren't you?

452
00:27:57.886 --> 00:27:59.985
You should go. I have an appointment.

453
00:28:03.856 --> 00:28:05.725
I am not good enough...

454
00:28:05.725 --> 00:28:07.995
to read your face or mind.

455
00:28:10.866 --> 00:28:12.225
But I've been doing this for years.

456
00:28:12.796 --> 00:28:14.396
I can smell that something is wrong,

457
00:28:16.836 --> 00:28:19.005
although I don't know what I am smelling.

458
00:28:19.765 --> 00:28:20.975
See you.

459
00:28:31.515 --> 00:28:33.146
You booked the ticket to Hawaii, didn't you?

460
00:28:33.146 --> 00:28:34.356
I did, ma'am.

461
00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:35.916
Okay.

462
00:28:40.556 --> 00:28:43.396
It's all Yang Mi Jung's fault.

463
00:28:52.106 --> 00:28:53.106
Ji An.

464
00:28:58.576 --> 00:29:00.376
Why are you still here?

465
00:29:00.715 --> 00:29:03.916
Come with me, Ji An.

466
00:29:04.346 --> 00:29:05.785
Who are you to say that?

467
00:29:07.856 --> 00:29:09.316
Who are you?

468
00:29:10.386 --> 00:29:11.455
A friend?

469
00:29:12.955 --> 00:29:14.225
I don't care.

470
00:29:15.195 --> 00:29:17.465
I don't care that you found me.

471
00:29:18.566 --> 00:29:19.826
How about your family?

472
00:29:20.096 --> 00:29:21.695
Aren't you worried about them?

473
00:29:21.695 --> 00:29:23.666
Your parents must be worried about you.

474
00:29:24.366 --> 00:29:25.666
I don't want to care about them.

475
00:29:27.306 --> 00:29:28.306
What?

476
00:29:28.876 --> 00:29:31.106
I don't care about anyone.

477
00:29:35.215 --> 00:29:36.715
Why are you so slow?

478
00:29:38.245 --> 00:29:39.316
Get in.

479
00:29:40.685 --> 00:29:42.356
I intentionally stopped her.

480
00:29:42.356 --> 00:29:43.386
If I let her go,

481
00:29:43.386 --> 00:29:45.525
she was going to die somewhere else.

482
00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:48.796
Are those a sane person's eyes?

483
00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:50.265
There's no life in them.

484
00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:53.695
Dinner is ready.

485
00:30:53.755 --> 00:30:54.826
Okay.

486
00:31:04.566 --> 00:31:06.435
What am I supposed to do?

487
00:31:13.076 --> 00:31:15.416
(Choi Do Kyung)

488
00:31:15.876 --> 00:31:17.886
Should I tell him?

489
00:31:21.215 --> 00:31:22.356
Please.

490
00:31:23.255 --> 00:31:24.925
If you reach her,

491
00:31:25.255 --> 00:31:26.925
please inform me...

492
00:31:27.925 --> 00:31:29.225
without telling her.

493
00:31:31.566 --> 00:31:32.695
I beg you.

494
00:31:41.576 --> 00:31:44.205
(Choi Do Kyung)

495
00:31:47.245 --> 00:31:48.675
Say an heir to a big corporation is...

496
00:31:48.675 --> 00:31:51.146
desperately looking for this ordinary girl.

497
00:31:51.146 --> 00:31:52.316
They dated,

498
00:31:52.316 --> 00:31:54.056
but his family destroyed the relationship.

499
00:31:54.056 --> 00:31:56.715
After getting abused, the girl hid.

500
00:31:56.715 --> 00:31:58.826
And the guy is looking all over for her.

501
00:31:58.826 --> 00:31:59.856
That's it.

502
00:32:04.995 --> 00:32:06.025
Ji An.

503
00:32:07.136 --> 00:32:08.796
What am I supposed to do?

504
00:32:16.806 --> 00:32:17.945
You're home.

505
00:32:17.945 --> 00:32:18.945
Follow me.

506
00:32:25.386 --> 00:32:27.616
Which one is her toothbrush?

507
00:32:28.316 --> 00:32:30.725
Seo Hyun uses an electric toothbrush.

508
00:32:30.725 --> 00:32:32.056
I haven't bought...

509
00:32:32.056 --> 00:32:33.856
a toothbrush sterilizer for Eun Seok yet.

510
00:32:34.525 --> 00:32:36.396
Then this must be it.

511
00:32:36.896 --> 00:32:38.225
Bring this out...

512
00:32:38.225 --> 00:32:39.695
and give her a new one.

513
00:32:47.336 --> 00:32:48.775
Take the hairbrush too.

514
00:32:48.775 --> 00:32:50.205
We will double check it.

515
00:32:50.505 --> 00:32:51.546
Yes, ma'am.

516
00:32:56.416 --> 00:32:59.185
Is that all cosmetics she has?

517
00:33:07.725 --> 00:33:09.695
Have the DNA test with them.

518
00:33:12.666 --> 00:33:13.836
Ma'am.

519
00:33:14.296 --> 00:33:16.906
Vice President Choi already tested it.

520
00:33:16.906 --> 00:33:18.535
He had Ji An's DNA tested.

521
00:33:19.166 --> 00:33:20.675
It just proves that Ji An is not our daughter.

522
00:33:20.675 --> 00:33:22.935
It doesn't mean Ji Soo is our daughter.

523
00:33:23.205 --> 00:33:24.346
Pardon?

524
00:33:25.205 --> 00:33:28.675
I didn't think Jo Soon Ok could've lied to me.

525
00:33:29.316 --> 00:33:31.685
What if someone else is real Eun Seok,

526
00:33:31.916 --> 00:33:34.285
and she told me one of them were her...

527
00:33:34.416 --> 00:33:36.015
just by showing me two toothbrushes?

528
00:33:41.225 --> 00:33:43.025
I just want to be sure.

529
00:33:43.566 --> 00:33:44.896
I can't get fooled again.

530
00:33:44.896 --> 00:33:46.066
Yes, ma'am.

531
00:33:46.166 --> 00:33:48.535
- Ms. Min. - Yes, ma'am.

532
00:33:49.866 --> 00:33:53.035
I got toothbrushes from Yang Mi Jung for DNA test.

533
00:33:53.636 --> 00:33:56.306
Did you tell my husband about that?

534
00:33:56.576 --> 00:33:58.606
- Yes. - When?

535
00:33:58.606 --> 00:34:02.076
He called me to his office and asked. So I told him.

536
00:34:02.076 --> 00:34:05.116
How could you do that without consulting me?

537
00:34:05.445 --> 00:34:07.755
You should've told me when he called you.

538
00:34:09.655 --> 00:34:12.385
I thought I was in charge...

539
00:34:12.655 --> 00:34:14.126
of this whole family.

540
00:34:14.356 --> 00:34:15.396
What?

541
00:34:15.396 --> 00:34:17.265
I'm not just working for you.

542
00:34:18.325 --> 00:34:21.736
Vice President Choi is also my boss.

543
00:34:21.736 --> 00:34:23.966
I'm supposed to answer his questions.

544
00:34:24.305 --> 00:34:26.305
- Then Jo Soon Ok... - Please don't worry.

545
00:34:26.935 --> 00:34:29.676
I didn't tell him anything about Jo Soon Ok.

546
00:34:30.106 --> 00:34:32.606
I told him I don't know Jo Soon Ok's whereabouts.

547
00:34:33.575 --> 00:34:35.975
He just asked me how the DNA test was taken,

548
00:34:36.245 --> 00:34:39.115
so I told him the truth.

549
00:34:40.555 --> 00:34:41.885
Then...

550
00:34:43.955 --> 00:34:47.455
I'll have the DNA test with these immediately.

551
00:34:51.365 --> 00:34:54.236
Before you tell your husband about this,

552
00:34:54.595 --> 00:34:56.066
I won't say anything.

553
00:35:04.876 --> 00:35:06.506
Look at her.

554
00:35:14.015 --> 00:35:15.256
Pull over.

555
00:35:20.325 --> 00:35:22.325
Get in the car. I'll come with you.

556
00:35:23.225 --> 00:35:26.666
I'm almost home. I'll just walk.

557
00:35:31.765 --> 00:35:32.765
Get in.

558
00:35:58.595 --> 00:35:59.995
"How are you?"

559
00:36:01.595 --> 00:36:02.666
Pardon?

560
00:36:02.666 --> 00:36:05.006
Or "How was your day?"

561
00:36:05.305 --> 00:36:07.075
You could say such things.

562
00:36:10.035 --> 00:36:11.506
How was your day?

563
00:36:13.276 --> 00:36:15.845
I came home early so I can have dinner with you.

564
00:36:17.385 --> 00:36:18.446
Okay.

565
00:36:39.365 --> 00:36:42.035
What do you think about the birdcage? Is it good?

566
00:36:43.405 --> 00:36:44.506
No.

567
00:36:45.006 --> 00:36:46.205
No?

568
00:36:46.405 --> 00:36:48.276
I don't like metal bars.

569
00:36:48.745 --> 00:36:51.285
When I lived in a semi-basement room,

570
00:36:51.285 --> 00:36:53.245
Ji An always slept by the window.

571
00:36:56.885 --> 00:36:59.626
Mom!

572
00:37:02.995 --> 00:37:04.066
What?

573
00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:06.935
Nothing.

574
00:37:07.495 --> 00:37:10.765
I had a dream where I was crying in bars before.

575
00:37:11.035 --> 00:37:12.466
I just recalled it.

576
00:37:12.935 --> 00:37:14.236
In bars?

577
00:37:14.575 --> 00:37:15.975
It wasn't a birdcage?

578
00:37:16.336 --> 00:37:17.376
Pardon?

579
00:37:18.006 --> 00:37:21.575
Your brother put you in the cage when you were 3.

580
00:37:22.946 --> 00:37:24.285
My brother?

581
00:37:24.816 --> 00:37:28.356
You cried holding the bars and fell with the cage.

582
00:37:29.356 --> 00:37:31.455
So it wasn't a dream.

583
00:37:31.825 --> 00:37:32.856
It was a memory.

584
00:37:33.325 --> 00:37:36.725
So you have some memory even though it's not good.

585
00:37:44.205 --> 00:37:45.535
You're home.

586
00:37:46.635 --> 00:37:48.176
- You're here. - Yes.

587
00:37:48.876 --> 00:37:51.546
- I'm hungry. - Dinner is ready.

588
00:37:51.745 --> 00:37:53.205
Let's wash up and have dinner.

589
00:37:53.376 --> 00:37:55.876
- Where's the bathroom? - This way.

590
00:37:57.685 --> 00:38:00.955
She didn't even put her purse down yet.

591
00:38:06.486 --> 00:38:08.196
Why did you share the car with her?

592
00:38:08.196 --> 00:38:09.856
You could've been seen.

593
00:38:10.825 --> 00:38:12.495
A guilty conscience needs no accuser.

594
00:38:12.896 --> 00:38:14.495
We could have a guest.

595
00:38:15.495 --> 00:38:17.236
You can never be too cautious.

596
00:38:18.265 --> 00:38:20.166
It's closing the barn door after the horse has fled.

597
00:38:21.575 --> 00:38:23.575
That's enough, Choi Jae Sung.

598
00:38:26.805 --> 00:38:28.446
You should stop this.

599
00:38:29.146 --> 00:38:30.446
What did I do?

600
00:38:30.446 --> 00:38:32.345
You're not accepting her with your heart.

601
00:38:33.015 --> 00:38:34.916
She's been here for more than a week.

602
00:38:35.256 --> 00:38:36.685
Don't you feel sorry for Eun Seok?

603
00:38:38.385 --> 00:38:41.455
It's not like that. It's just hard.

604
00:38:42.196 --> 00:38:43.626
Isn't it hard for you as well?

605
00:38:43.626 --> 00:38:45.526
She's nothing like Ji An.

606
00:38:46.966 --> 00:38:48.365
When Ji An was here,

607
00:38:49.166 --> 00:38:51.865
I thought she was my long-lost daughter.

608
00:38:52.466 --> 00:38:54.376
I embraced her with all my heart.

609
00:38:55.305 --> 00:38:57.575
I know. I felt the same way.

610
00:39:01.345 --> 00:39:02.716
I can accept her with my head,

611
00:39:03.946 --> 00:39:05.685
but I can't do that with my heart.

612
00:39:06.586 --> 00:39:08.216
That's why we should try harder.

613
00:39:09.155 --> 00:39:10.185
As Ji Soo said,

614
00:39:11.126 --> 00:39:13.626
it was our fault. It's my fault...

615
00:39:14.126 --> 00:39:15.825
that I only took your word for it.

616
00:39:16.595 --> 00:39:19.796
That made our daughter get hurt so bad.

617
00:39:22.495 --> 00:39:23.836
You're blaming me again.

618
00:39:23.935 --> 00:39:26.365
Tell Yang Mi Jung she can run her restaurant.

619
00:39:26.975 --> 00:39:28.305
I'll tell Seo Tae Soo...

620
00:39:28.736 --> 00:39:31.745
to forget the whole thing and keep it a secret.

621
00:39:32.646 --> 00:39:34.475
So there's nothing we can do?

622
00:39:34.975 --> 00:39:36.646
We have to admit it was our fault.

623
00:39:37.185 --> 00:39:40.086
We told them not to turn themselves in.

624
00:39:41.115 --> 00:39:42.385
As Ji Soo said,

625
00:39:43.416 --> 00:39:45.526
the mistake you made 25 years ago...

626
00:39:45.685 --> 00:39:49.095
was the main cause of losing Eun Seok.

627
00:39:52.166 --> 00:39:53.225
All right.

628
00:39:54.435 --> 00:39:57.035
It was my bad I didn't check the back seat.

629
00:39:57.935 --> 00:40:01.836
So you've blamed me for the past 25 years.

630
00:40:05.046 --> 00:40:07.716
I could've found her if I didn't have an accident.

631
00:40:08.115 --> 00:40:09.345
You think?

632
00:40:09.916 --> 00:40:11.146
Of course.

633
00:40:11.745 --> 00:40:14.155
I would've gone back to the rest area right away.

634
00:40:14.155 --> 00:40:15.285
That's enough.

635
00:40:18.086 --> 00:40:19.986
Eun Seok says she's hungry.

636
00:40:21.026 --> 00:40:22.796
All you need to worry about now...

637
00:40:23.325 --> 00:40:25.666
is finding the person who sent me the letter.

638
00:40:36.006 --> 00:40:37.146
Right.

639
00:40:37.845 --> 00:40:39.405
Why aren't they asking me for money?

640
00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:43.276
I'm so hungry.

641
00:40:45.285 --> 00:40:47.856
Aren't you hungry? It's already past seven.

642
00:40:49.586 --> 00:40:50.626
I'm hungry.

643
00:40:52.986 --> 00:40:55.856
You shouldn't eat before Mom and Dad come.

644
00:40:56.926 --> 00:40:58.225
This family is so weird.

645
00:40:58.265 --> 00:41:00.126
Whenever I say I'm hungry,

646
00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:02.796
my mom makes some noodles for me immediately.

647
00:41:05.836 --> 00:41:07.475
I'm sorry for making you wait.

648
00:41:07.475 --> 00:41:09.176
You're here.

649
00:41:09.876 --> 00:41:11.245
Why are you standing up?

650
00:41:11.245 --> 00:41:12.546
You don't need to stand up.

651
00:41:18.586 --> 00:41:19.716
Let's eat.

652
00:41:25.586 --> 00:41:27.296
Can I have some soy sauce?

653
00:41:27.655 --> 00:41:28.955
Is it not seasoned well?

654
00:41:28.955 --> 00:41:30.896
It's too bland for me.

655
00:41:31.796 --> 00:41:33.225
Is it bland?

656
00:41:33.765 --> 00:41:34.765
The cook is...

657
00:41:34.765 --> 00:41:37.135
They made it bland so we can appreciate...

658
00:41:37.435 --> 00:41:39.305
the real taste of ingredients.

659
00:41:39.635 --> 00:41:42.035
You'll appreciate it once you try it.

660
00:41:42.575 --> 00:41:45.405
I'm not sure what's the true taste of ingredients,

661
00:41:45.575 --> 00:41:47.575
but I just want delicious food.

662
00:41:48.115 --> 00:41:50.115
I'll have some ramyeon instead.

663
00:41:50.115 --> 00:41:53.446
Ji Soo. We don't have ramyeon here.

664
00:41:53.555 --> 00:41:55.916
I know. So I bought some today.

665
00:41:57.126 --> 00:41:58.356
Do you want some?

666
00:41:58.356 --> 00:42:00.796
No. I don't eat such a thing.

667
00:42:01.296 --> 00:42:02.626
Okay then.

668
00:42:04.796 --> 00:42:06.066
Have a seat.

669
00:42:06.265 --> 00:42:08.095
I'll cook some ramyeon.

670
00:42:08.095 --> 00:42:09.296
Sit down.

671
00:42:09.966 --> 00:42:12.666
Ask my permission before leaving your seat.

672
00:42:22.646 --> 00:42:23.916
Cook some ramyeon for her.

673
00:42:24.845 --> 00:42:28.615
Make it two. I want to have ramyeon with her.

674
00:42:30.115 --> 00:42:32.325
I want eggs in my ramyeon.

675
00:42:33.896 --> 00:42:35.426
Put in two eggs.

676
00:42:35.756 --> 00:42:36.966
Yes, sir.

677
00:43:07.396 --> 00:43:08.455
The noise...

678
00:43:09.325 --> 00:43:10.796
is so very loud.

679
00:43:11.095 --> 00:43:12.265
Ramyeon tastes best...

680
00:43:12.265 --> 00:43:14.495
when slurped like this.

681
00:43:23.705 --> 00:43:25.075
Bring me some aspirin.

682
00:43:47.196 --> 00:43:48.495
Let's eat out.

683
00:43:48.495 --> 00:43:49.966
Why cause more work?

684
00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:52.066
We're trying to save up...

685
00:43:52.066 --> 00:43:53.535
so we can move out.

686
00:43:54.176 --> 00:43:55.236
We're cooking dinner...

687
00:43:55.236 --> 00:43:56.705
instead of breakfast.

688
00:43:57.405 --> 00:44:00.345
Our situation isn't exactly that great.

689
00:44:00.845 --> 00:44:03.685
What? Didn't you drag me out this morning...

690
00:44:03.885 --> 00:44:05.916
to stick to the rules?

691
00:44:07.655 --> 00:44:09.385
Don't try so hard.

692
00:44:09.455 --> 00:44:10.825
I feel sorry to you.

693
00:44:10.825 --> 00:44:13.626
Me? How am I trying?

694
00:44:13.626 --> 00:44:15.955
You're pretending to not be bothered.

695
00:44:16.026 --> 00:44:17.696
I'm not bothered.

696
00:44:17.966 --> 00:44:20.435
I've decided not to let circumstances...

697
00:44:20.435 --> 00:44:21.535
influence us.

698
00:44:22.535 --> 00:44:24.166
We struggled to get married.

699
00:44:24.905 --> 00:44:27.376
I'm fighting for our marriage.

700
00:44:30.876 --> 00:44:33.305
Are you touched?

701
00:44:35.075 --> 00:44:37.316
You're frugal and wise.

702
00:44:37.586 --> 00:44:39.615
I married a great woman.

703
00:44:40.086 --> 00:44:41.555
Be good to me then.

704
00:44:41.685 --> 00:44:43.086
You too.

705
00:44:47.655 --> 00:44:49.155
Open your mouth wide.

706
00:44:54.966 --> 00:44:55.966
It's good.

707
00:44:56.466 --> 00:44:57.805
I might end up...

708
00:44:57.805 --> 00:44:59.336
cooking this for a month.

709
00:44:59.336 --> 00:45:01.535
I'll eat anything you make.

710
00:45:01.535 --> 00:45:04.106
I once had kimchi fried rice for two months.

711
00:45:04.575 --> 00:45:06.705
Shall we plan a dinner menu?

712
00:45:06.876 --> 00:45:09.345
No, the time you get off work is irregular.

713
00:45:09.515 --> 00:45:10.816
We'll just waste ingredients.

714
00:45:11.586 --> 00:45:13.555
Mother works late,

715
00:45:13.685 --> 00:45:15.756
and Father's been coming home late.

716
00:45:19.285 --> 00:45:21.155
Is that how all parents feel?

717
00:45:22.325 --> 00:45:24.595
Your sister won't want to talk to them.

718
00:45:25.796 --> 00:45:28.035
Just so she can be at peace.

719
00:45:29.365 --> 00:45:31.135
How does he know where she is?

720
00:45:31.135 --> 00:45:32.566
Why does he even look for her?

721
00:45:32.935 --> 00:45:34.475
Don't raise your voice.

722
00:45:35.376 --> 00:45:36.705
I'm frustrated.

723
00:45:37.745 --> 00:45:40.106
I don't like seeing them trying to make amends.

724
00:45:42.745 --> 00:45:44.015
I'm thirsty.

725
00:45:44.015 --> 00:45:45.115
Can I have some water?

726
00:45:46.086 --> 00:45:47.615
I forgot to bring some.

727
00:45:47.615 --> 00:45:48.756
Go on eating.

728
00:46:06.805 --> 00:46:09.635
(Welcome to Canada!)

729
00:46:25.685 --> 00:46:26.825
We should...

730
00:46:27.225 --> 00:46:29.595
install a small fridge in here.

731
00:46:29.856 --> 00:46:31.566
So we won't have to make a trip downstairs.

732
00:46:35.265 --> 00:46:37.606
What for? We're going to emigrate anyway.

733
00:46:41.805 --> 00:46:43.745
How did you find that?

734
00:46:43.745 --> 00:46:46.075
I'd hidden something in there as well.

735
00:46:47.515 --> 00:46:50.075
I was going to tell you after dinner.

736
00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:52.385
I'd like you to go first.

737
00:46:53.086 --> 00:46:54.185
What's this?

738
00:46:54.615 --> 00:46:56.216
Are you considering emigrating?

739
00:46:57.426 --> 00:46:59.486
I looked into it just in case.

740
00:47:00.126 --> 00:47:01.426
I didn't want to wait...

741
00:47:01.426 --> 00:47:03.196
until Haesung came after us.

742
00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:05.225
To be honest,

743
00:47:06.095 --> 00:47:07.666
I wanted to leave.

744
00:47:08.896 --> 00:47:09.896
This house,

745
00:47:10.765 --> 00:47:11.805
my parents.

746
00:47:11.966 --> 00:47:13.205
(Welcome to Canada!)

747
00:47:15.676 --> 00:47:18.106
Father gave us 10,000 dollars to move.

748
00:47:18.876 --> 00:47:19.876
When?

749
00:47:20.475 --> 00:47:21.646
A few days ago.

750
00:47:22.575 --> 00:47:25.446
He said we should move out so we can...

751
00:47:25.446 --> 00:47:27.055
enjoy being newlyweds.

752
00:47:28.756 --> 00:47:30.325
I didn't tell you right away...

753
00:47:31.126 --> 00:47:32.356
because...

754
00:47:32.356 --> 00:47:34.225
I actually considered the offer.

755
00:47:35.055 --> 00:47:36.555
You should've told me.

756
00:47:36.555 --> 00:47:37.666
Why didn't you?

757
00:47:37.666 --> 00:47:38.865
We said we'd go on with...

758
00:47:38.865 --> 00:47:40.966
our lives regardless of the circumstances.

759
00:47:41.666 --> 00:47:43.365
I thought I was breaking that rule.

760
00:47:44.606 --> 00:47:45.635
But...

761
00:47:46.905 --> 00:47:49.575
now that I see you were considering emigrating,

762
00:47:50.405 --> 00:47:52.006
you should make the call.

763
00:48:20.336 --> 00:48:21.435
Excuse me.

764
00:48:23.305 --> 00:48:25.905
Are you Seo Ji An's father?

765
00:48:26.705 --> 00:48:29.776
Yes, I'm Seo Ji An's father.

766
00:48:30.515 --> 00:48:31.515
Why?

767
00:48:31.515 --> 00:48:34.015
Has something happened to her?

768
00:48:34.486 --> 00:48:36.856
No. No, sir.

769
00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:40.296
I had something to ask her.

770
00:48:41.796 --> 00:48:44.796
Has she not come home yet?

771
00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:47.595
Not yet.

772
00:48:48.495 --> 00:48:51.236
What's the matter? Why are you here?

773
00:48:52.205 --> 00:48:54.075
I had questions about her work,

774
00:48:54.535 --> 00:48:56.236
but she isn't answering her phone.

775
00:48:58.345 --> 00:49:00.216
Okay. I'll tell her to call you...

776
00:49:00.216 --> 00:49:02.075
if I hear from her.

777
00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:15.155
Why hasn't she come home yet?

778
00:49:37.416 --> 00:49:39.515
She was definitely on her way home.

779
00:49:42.055 --> 00:49:43.785
Why didn't she return?

780
00:50:09.475 --> 00:50:10.685
She saw that.

781
00:50:12.785 --> 00:50:14.015
She saw it.

782
00:50:18.126 --> 00:50:20.825
Do you know what I said to my dad?

783
00:50:21.356 --> 00:50:23.495
I totally crushed him.

784
00:50:24.966 --> 00:50:27.336
I can't let him go through...

785
00:50:27.336 --> 00:50:29.836
that kind of humiliation.

786
00:50:30.305 --> 00:50:31.666
You know very well...

787
00:50:32.765 --> 00:50:35.106
what your parents will do to mine.

788
00:50:35.106 --> 00:50:37.106
My family will be wrecked.

789
00:50:37.475 --> 00:50:39.646
My mom will be jailed for fraud..

790
00:50:39.845 --> 00:50:41.046
My dad will go insane...

791
00:50:41.046 --> 00:50:42.745
with guilt and disappointment.

792
00:50:46.885 --> 00:50:48.185
She saw it.

793
00:50:58.865 --> 00:50:59.926
I'm coming in.

794
00:51:00.535 --> 00:51:01.595
Okay.

795
00:51:09.205 --> 00:51:10.276
Ji Soo.

796
00:51:11.245 --> 00:51:14.146
Did Ji An call you?

797
00:51:14.146 --> 00:51:15.276
No.

798
00:51:15.816 --> 00:51:18.015
And she won't from now on.

799
00:51:18.615 --> 00:51:21.055
Why not? You two were close.

800
00:51:21.055 --> 00:51:22.316
When we met,

801
00:51:22.316 --> 00:51:23.926
I got really angry.

802
00:51:24.655 --> 00:51:25.825
You met her?

803
00:51:26.356 --> 00:51:27.426
When?

804
00:51:27.926 --> 00:51:29.055
Where?

805
00:51:30.026 --> 00:51:31.696
Why do you ask?

806
00:51:33.696 --> 00:51:35.365
I have to ask about work,

807
00:51:35.365 --> 00:51:36.865
but I can't reach her.

808
00:51:37.435 --> 00:51:39.705
At the park behind the bakery.

809
00:51:40.805 --> 00:51:41.836
When?

810
00:51:41.836 --> 00:51:43.475
The day I came here.

811
00:51:44.606 --> 00:51:46.305
Were you angry that...

812
00:51:46.506 --> 00:51:47.676
she didn't tell you first?

813
00:51:56.785 --> 00:51:58.055
Why?

814
00:51:59.325 --> 00:52:00.495
I put it off...

815
00:52:00.495 --> 00:52:03.296
because you weren't in the mood to talk.

816
00:52:03.896 --> 00:52:04.966
I have something to say.

817
00:52:06.196 --> 00:52:09.296
Ji An had a scar on her toe.

818
00:52:11.236 --> 00:52:13.336
That's how she knew it wasn't her.

819
00:52:13.535 --> 00:52:15.405
The scar on her pinkie toe?

820
00:52:18.376 --> 00:52:20.075
She told me right away...

821
00:52:20.975 --> 00:52:22.745
that she wasn't my sister.

822
00:52:23.245 --> 00:52:25.946
That you were my sister.

823
00:52:27.086 --> 00:52:30.155
But because of a big company event, I...

824
00:52:30.155 --> 00:52:32.026
She told you,

825
00:52:33.126 --> 00:52:35.026
but not me?

826
00:52:35.095 --> 00:52:36.655
She was worried about you.

827
00:52:36.865 --> 00:52:37.995
But before that,

828
00:52:38.626 --> 00:52:40.595
she was concerned for your parents.

829
00:52:42.035 --> 00:52:43.336
You're a victim,

830
00:52:43.935 --> 00:52:45.836
but they were perpetrators.

831
00:52:46.836 --> 00:52:48.336
If our family found out...

832
00:52:48.336 --> 00:52:49.405
Actually,

833
00:52:50.176 --> 00:52:52.245
I was so angry when I found out.

834
00:52:54.316 --> 00:52:56.446
That's why she couldn't tell you.

835
00:52:57.316 --> 00:52:58.446
If you found out,

836
00:52:59.285 --> 00:53:01.785
the secret would get out before the event was over.

837
00:53:03.086 --> 00:53:04.555
She was worried for you...

838
00:53:05.555 --> 00:53:07.055
and for your parents,

839
00:53:07.756 --> 00:53:09.696
- but to shield them... - Stop.

840
00:53:11.995 --> 00:53:13.026
Do you think...

841
00:53:13.765 --> 00:53:15.236
telling me that...

842
00:53:15.765 --> 00:53:18.035
will help do away with the misunderstanding?

843
00:53:19.166 --> 00:53:20.205
It won't?

844
00:53:20.205 --> 00:53:22.106
It's just the same to me.

845
00:53:23.106 --> 00:53:25.676
She should've told me as soon as she found out.

846
00:53:26.046 --> 00:53:29.376
She should've told me so we'd solve it together.

847
00:53:30.946 --> 00:53:32.115
She didn't...

848
00:53:32.546 --> 00:53:34.015
trust me.

849
00:53:35.185 --> 00:53:37.026
She didn't think of me as her sister.

850
00:53:38.655 --> 00:53:40.256
She's just like our parents.

851
00:53:46.225 --> 00:53:47.836
I want to turn myself in.

852
00:53:48.796 --> 00:53:49.796
What?

853
00:53:49.796 --> 00:53:52.236
For whatever reason, I did wrong.

854
00:53:52.666 --> 00:53:54.506
I have to pay the price.

855
00:53:55.475 --> 00:53:56.876
If I go to prison,

856
00:53:57.606 --> 00:54:02.216
our kids will be safe and they won't touch Ji An.

857
00:54:02.216 --> 00:54:05.816
We don't know where Ji An is or if she's even alive.

858
00:54:05.816 --> 00:54:08.586
Don't do this. What got into you?

859
00:54:08.586 --> 00:54:11.825
Is the work that hard? Is it that humiliating?

860
00:54:12.126 --> 00:54:14.655
No, it's not embarrassing at all.

861
00:54:14.655 --> 00:54:17.466
I can work for centuries if our kids won't mind.

862
00:54:17.765 --> 00:54:20.435
I'd even go in as their helper.

863
00:54:21.796 --> 00:54:24.135
Ji An's staying away because of me.

864
00:54:24.865 --> 00:54:26.205
She can't stand me.

865
00:54:27.506 --> 00:54:28.935
Ji Soo turned against me...

866
00:54:30.606 --> 00:54:31.776
and Ji Ho too.

867
00:54:33.245 --> 00:54:34.376
Ji Tae...

868
00:54:35.546 --> 00:54:36.745
and Soo A.

869
00:54:39.946 --> 00:54:42.555
Why live when my kids can't respect me?

870
00:54:43.955 --> 00:54:45.256
I'll turn myself in...

871
00:54:46.225 --> 00:54:47.595
and do time in prison.

872
00:54:48.055 --> 00:54:49.655
When I'm released,

873
00:54:50.325 --> 00:54:51.526
then maybe...

874
00:54:51.626 --> 00:54:54.595
You are so foolish.

875
00:54:55.635 --> 00:54:58.506
I want to pay for the foolish deeds I did.

876
00:54:58.705 --> 00:55:00.135
That's not being foolish.

877
00:55:00.305 --> 00:55:01.705
We must pay...

878
00:55:01.905 --> 00:55:05.446
in whichever way Ji Soo's parents decide.

879
00:55:05.546 --> 00:55:07.975
We must do as they say.

880
00:55:07.975 --> 00:55:09.845
What if our kids don't forgive me?

881
00:55:11.745 --> 00:55:14.455
I can't live without Ji An and Ji Soo's forgiveness.

882
00:55:15.685 --> 00:55:16.926
What if...

883
00:55:17.455 --> 00:55:19.285
I never see Ji Soo again?

884
00:55:20.126 --> 00:55:22.995
What if she never wants to see me again?

885
00:55:24.466 --> 00:55:25.825
I can't live like that.

886
00:55:50.115 --> 00:55:51.356
Stop the car.

887
00:56:06.705 --> 00:56:07.805
My goodness.

888
00:56:09.205 --> 00:56:11.646
How dare you come here?

889
00:56:13.176 --> 00:56:14.475
I apologize.

890
00:56:15.015 --> 00:56:16.946
Are you pretending to be a mourning mom?

891
00:56:18.986 --> 00:56:20.816
I want to see Ji Soo just once...

892
00:56:22.756 --> 00:56:24.785
before I turn myself in.

893
00:56:26.026 --> 00:56:27.225
What?

894
00:56:27.396 --> 00:56:29.896
Even if I pay by doing time in prison,

895
00:56:29.955 --> 00:56:31.995
I know it won't be enough for you.

896
00:56:33.696 --> 00:56:36.236
I can't even touch the money I make.

897
00:56:36.635 --> 00:56:39.736
I can't even touch it, let alone spend it.

898
00:56:40.535 --> 00:56:42.276
I left it in the kitchen fridge.

899
00:56:42.376 --> 00:56:44.006
That's what I want for you.

900
00:56:44.006 --> 00:56:46.006
You can't turn yourself in.

901
00:56:47.216 --> 00:56:49.946
You will both feel better if I go away.

902
00:56:50.745 --> 00:56:52.816
I did something dreadful to you.

903
00:56:53.146 --> 00:56:54.816
What good is it to humiliate me...

904
00:56:54.816 --> 00:56:56.486
by making me earn money?

905
00:56:59.426 --> 00:57:00.696
Humiliation?

906
00:57:02.495 --> 00:57:03.896
My own kids...

907
00:57:04.365 --> 00:57:05.725
humiliate me.

908
00:57:06.666 --> 00:57:07.966
Even Ji Soo.

909
00:57:09.035 --> 00:57:10.765
She won't even call me.

910
00:57:11.805 --> 00:57:14.676
What will she say if you turn yourself in?

911
00:57:14.776 --> 00:57:16.575
Won't she blame us...

912
00:57:16.946 --> 00:57:19.475
for imprisoning the mom who raised her?

913
00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:23.015
Prison?

914
00:57:24.216 --> 00:57:25.986
I want you to go away forever,

915
00:57:26.615 --> 00:57:28.385
but I can't for Ji Soo's sake.

916
00:57:29.015 --> 00:57:31.385
So go away and do as you're told.

917
00:57:31.385 --> 00:57:33.455
Don't ever loiter near my house again.

918
00:57:41.435 --> 00:57:42.666
Ji Soo.

919
00:57:50.776 --> 00:57:51.845
Ma'am.

920
00:57:52.106 --> 00:57:53.716
Ji Soo.

921
00:57:53.716 --> 00:57:56.416
Why are you mopping alone? Where's Mr. Sunwoo?

922
00:57:57.946 --> 00:57:59.946
He went to the Incheon sawmill yesterday...

923
00:57:59.946 --> 00:58:01.716
and didn't return.

924
00:58:01.716 --> 00:58:03.416
He isn't back yet?

925
00:58:03.586 --> 00:58:05.086
What do you mean "yet"?

926
00:58:05.086 --> 00:58:07.856
We went to Incheon together.

927
00:58:07.856 --> 00:58:10.265
My boss told me to go to Incheon...

928
00:58:10.265 --> 00:58:12.066
to get some salt.

929
00:58:12.396 --> 00:58:14.066
Your boss sent you?

930
00:58:17.106 --> 00:58:19.066
I'm here to deliver Sunwoo Hyuk.

931
00:58:20.276 --> 00:58:22.305
Why are you bringing him home?

932
00:58:22.606 --> 00:58:25.606
My back's about to break. Let's put him down.

933
00:58:26.805 --> 00:58:28.916
What's the matter?

934
00:58:29.115 --> 00:58:31.185
Was it very important?

935
00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:33.756
I don't know.

936
00:58:33.955 --> 00:58:36.115
Why are you here?

937
00:58:36.316 --> 00:58:38.325
I brought some bread.

938
00:58:39.256 --> 00:58:40.926
Why did you bring this?

939
00:58:41.595 --> 00:58:45.196
Ji Soo, I told you clearly I don't want your bread...

940
00:58:45.365 --> 00:58:46.966
and even settled the bill.

941
00:58:47.066 --> 00:58:48.935
Why did you bring more?

942
00:58:49.196 --> 00:58:51.535
My boss sent me.

943
00:58:51.935 --> 00:58:54.075
I thought you had changed your mind.

944
00:58:54.075 --> 00:58:56.705
I won't repeat myself three times.

945
00:58:57.376 --> 00:58:59.376
Don't ever bring your bread.

946
00:58:59.676 --> 00:59:02.316
Okay. I apologize.

947
00:59:16.595 --> 00:59:17.966
Mr. Baker!

948
00:59:18.526 --> 00:59:19.825
You startled me.

949
00:59:21.466 --> 00:59:23.466
Isn't this deja vu?

950
00:59:23.566 --> 00:59:26.705
She said she doesn't want our bread.

951
00:59:27.905 --> 00:59:29.006
She said no?

952
00:59:29.135 --> 00:59:30.446
What's wrong with you?

953
00:59:30.506 --> 00:59:33.345
Why are you hitting on a married woman?

954
00:59:33.345 --> 00:59:35.075
She was so angry with me.

955
00:59:35.075 --> 00:59:37.845
I don't think I can go back there again.

956
00:59:37.845 --> 00:59:39.986
How will I get to see Mr. Sunwoo again?

957
00:59:41.486 --> 00:59:43.685
You said you were over him.

958
00:59:44.455 --> 00:59:46.955
The woman he likes likes someone else.

959
00:59:47.256 --> 00:59:51.095
I can still like him if he isn't spoken for.

960
00:59:51.325 --> 00:59:53.396
Then I can still like her.

961
00:59:53.396 --> 00:59:55.796
You said groundless hope is delusion.

962
00:59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.376
- Not bad. - That was your advice.

963
01:00:00.736 --> 01:00:02.135
You told me not to care for...

964
01:00:02.135 --> 01:00:03.506
someone who isn't interested.

965
01:00:04.305 --> 01:00:05.845
She's not uninterested.

966
01:00:05.975 --> 01:00:07.975
She's married.

967
01:00:08.416 --> 01:00:10.515
- She's not married. - What?

968
01:00:10.716 --> 01:00:13.086
The cafe owner isn't married.

969
01:00:13.285 --> 01:00:14.615
She isn't married?

970
01:00:14.615 --> 01:00:17.426
Will you stop getting your facts wrong?

971
01:00:17.986 --> 01:00:19.356
That's strange.

972
01:00:19.356 --> 01:00:21.455
How do you know she isn't married?

973
01:00:28.566 --> 01:00:30.535
There are no subway stations nearby.

974
01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:32.905
The only bus stop...

975
01:00:33.336 --> 01:00:34.705
is that way, right?

976
01:00:34.975 --> 01:00:38.046
Yes, but she could've taken a taxi.

977
01:00:38.876 --> 01:00:40.646
No, she wouldn't have.

978
01:00:50.285 --> 01:00:51.455
Stop.

979
01:01:53.955 --> 01:01:55.455
Is this broken?

980
01:01:55.885 --> 01:01:57.256
I played it for two and a half hours,

981
01:01:57.256 --> 01:01:58.825
and she's still there.

982
01:01:58.986 --> 01:02:00.396
Please fast forward it a bit.

983
01:02:03.966 --> 01:02:06.265
Look. She's gone.

984
01:02:06.265 --> 01:02:07.635
Go back a bit.

985
01:02:09.696 --> 01:02:10.765
Stop, stop.

986
01:02:15.506 --> 01:02:17.046
Where does that bus go?

987
01:02:31.285 --> 01:02:33.995
Excuse me. Have you seen this person?

988
01:02:41.595 --> 01:02:43.765
Excuse me. Have you seen this person?

989
01:02:43.765 --> 01:02:45.365
No, sorry.

990
01:02:47.176 --> 01:02:49.676
Excuse me. Have you seen this person?

991
01:02:51.705 --> 01:02:53.916
Have you seen this person?

992
01:03:02.356 --> 01:03:03.356
(Seo Ji An)

993
01:03:05.055 --> 01:03:07.256
(Seo Ji An)

994
01:03:12.595 --> 01:03:14.435
- Mr. Choi. - Secretary Yoo.

995
01:03:14.435 --> 01:03:16.396
Locate Seo Ji An's cellphone now.

996
01:03:16.466 --> 01:03:17.805
Before that,

997
01:03:17.805 --> 01:03:20.506
someone's looking for this person in the picture.

998
01:03:20.975 --> 01:03:22.006
Who's that?

999
01:03:22.006 --> 01:03:23.876
He was here today,

1000
01:03:23.876 --> 01:03:25.276
but I'm not sure if it's her father.

1001
01:03:26.805 --> 01:03:28.176
Locate it now.

1002
01:03:28.176 --> 01:03:29.216
Yes, sir.

1003
01:03:36.885 --> 01:03:37.926
What?

1004
01:03:38.055 --> 01:03:39.385
(Sunwoo Hyuk)

1005
01:03:39.385 --> 01:03:41.126
Ji An's safe.

1006
01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:42.796
I'll tell you no more...

1007
01:03:42.796 --> 01:03:44.325
because she doesn't want me to.

1008
01:03:55.935 --> 01:03:58.146
(Choi Do Kyung)

1009
01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:09.170
<font face="Papyrus"><font color="#ff8000">Subtitle ripped and resynced by redixion</font></font>

1010
01:04:16.696 --> 01:04:17.995
Where's Ji An?

1011
01:04:18.495 --> 01:04:19.666
Have you met her?

1012
01:04:24.035 --> 01:04:25.535
Please call me.

1013
01:04:25.705 --> 01:04:27.575
I'd like to talk to Ji An.

1014
01:04:27.705 --> 01:04:29.236
Please tell her to give me a call.

1015
01:04:38.685 --> 01:04:43.856
(Choi Do Kyung)

1016
01:04:44.055 --> 01:04:45.586
The number you're dialing...

1017
01:04:45.586 --> 01:04:47.796
Why isn't he picking up?

1018
01:04:48.725 --> 01:04:50.865
I'm glad she's safe.

1019
01:04:50.865 --> 01:04:52.765
He promised to call me.

1020
01:04:52.765 --> 01:04:54.296
Telling me she's safe isn't enough.

1021
01:04:54.296 --> 01:04:56.635
She doesn't want it.

1022
01:04:56.635 --> 01:04:57.635
What?

1023
01:04:57.635 --> 01:04:59.535
Talking to you, sir.

1024
01:05:01.376 --> 01:05:02.376
Is that...

1025
01:05:03.575 --> 01:05:04.606
what that means?

1026
01:05:04.606 --> 01:05:06.575
If he's the one she called when she's suffering...

1027
01:05:06.575 --> 01:05:07.946
the most, you can trust him.

1028
01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:09.345
He will take care of her.

1029
01:05:11.916 --> 01:05:13.115
You think so?

1030
01:05:13.115 --> 01:05:14.555
Yes, yes, yes.

1031
01:05:15.785 --> 01:05:16.856
Right.

1032
01:05:17.725 --> 01:05:19.926
It's good that someone's taking care of her.

1033
01:05:21.655 --> 01:05:22.696
Let's go.

1034
01:06:03.736 --> 01:06:05.836
(Bus Stop)

1035
01:06:13.305 --> 01:06:14.615
(Youngheung Intercity Bus Terminal)

1036
01:06:57.486 --> 01:06:59.986
(My Golden Life)

1037
01:07:01.155 --> 01:07:03.626
Ji An still hasn't called.

1038
01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:05.325
It's been over a week.

1039
01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:06.865
What did you two talk about?

1040
01:07:06.865 --> 01:07:08.265
Why do you care...

1041
01:07:08.265 --> 01:07:09.365
what I talked about with Ji An?

1042
01:07:09.365 --> 01:07:10.805
Tell me now.

1043
01:07:10.805 --> 01:07:13.466
Do you wish Seo Ji Soo isn't your daughter?

1044
01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.106
No Myung Hee.

1045
01:07:15.106 --> 01:07:16.975
Do you think your daughter's born noble?

1046
01:07:16.975 --> 01:07:19.046
It's certain Seo Ji An's with her friend.

1047
01:07:19.046 --> 01:07:20.046
Is she all right?

1048
01:07:20.046 --> 01:07:21.475
Are you still worried?

1049
01:07:21.475 --> 01:07:23.245
No. Not at all!

1050
01:07:23.615 --> 01:07:25.416
The result of Seo Ji An's phone location...

1051
01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:26.916
shows the last place of reception...

1052
01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:27.955
was Incheon.

1053
01:07:28.155 --> 01:07:30.526
Hyuk. Let's go.
