1
00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:10.345
On Noo Ri.

2
00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:12.144
Stop what you're doing and leave them.

3
00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:13.845
- Father. - Leave now.

4
00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:15.214
On Noo Ri.

5
00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.314
The eldest son of Chief On Joo Sik.

6
00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.755
Don't touch him.

7
00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.395
- Why not? - You aren't...

8
00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:28.694
supposed to harm family members.

9
00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:30.564
Right, Hong Joo?

10
00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:32.634
You aren't...

11
00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:38.105
supposed to harm family members.

12
00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:42.204
What now?

13
00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:46.815
Should I take in these dogs for you?

14
00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:51.315
I mean,

15
00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:55.024
the great Cha family has been getting...

16
00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:56.355
harassed by these worthless scumbags.

17
00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:58.154
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

18
00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:01.264
I will take care of this.

19
00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:02.495
No.

20
00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:05.034
Let's see...

21
00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.695
what...

22
00:01:07.335 --> 00:01:10.635
Vice President Joo of JH can do.

23
00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:13.504
Dad.

24
00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.014
What's with that face?

25
00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.555
You look like a child whose toy was taken away.

26
00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:29.454
What's your plan?

27
00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:31.154
Do you want to know?

28
00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:34.055
Then can you help me?

29
00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:38.534
Gosh, this melts in my mouth.

30
00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:42.805
Excuse me, we'll take four more orders.

31
00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:45.805
You just had 10 servings. Are you ordering 4 more?

32
00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:47.204
Are you even a human?

33
00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:49.504
No, I'm Cheetah.

34
00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:51.775
The mighty landlord Mr. Kim Min Joon.

35
00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:53.245
You must be running out of cash.

36
00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.344
Do you want me to pay?

37
00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:56.085
Don't worry, tenant Ms. Jang.

38
00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:58.114
I'll take your overdue monthly rent.

39
00:01:58.114 --> 00:01:59.254
Are we overdue?

40
00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:02.055
- We are. - We haven't made much.

41
00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.355
- I'll send it right now. - It's okay, Mr. Choi.

42
00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.454
Who says so?

43
00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:07.355
- Take it from key money. - What?

44
00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:08.594
Oh, that's a way.

45
00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:10.065
- What did you say? - Take it off.

46
00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:11.334
- What? - Take it off.

47
00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:14.635
Take it off. Four servings of chuck flap tail.

48
00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:16.734
Gosh, you beggar-like dogs.

49
00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:17.774
That's why we're...

50
00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:19.234
- Mad Dog! - Mad Dog!

51
00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:31.214
Mr. Kim.

52
00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:40.125
Is this a challenge?

53
00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:50.304
Drink, drink, drink

54
00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:51.674
How can she drink that?

55
00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:55.475
What if she dies?

56
00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:13.394
You might get sick.

57
00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:15.665
What's wrong?

58
00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:18.364
My father is...

59
00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:21.464
about to make a move.

60
00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:28.045
Where are Mr. Choi and Pentium?

61
00:03:28.605 --> 00:03:30.144
I'm going back to the office.

62
00:03:30.144 --> 00:03:31.274
I feel sick.

63
00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:33.174
Hey, move your head.

64
00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:38.114
You should go home.

65
00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.584
We have to close too.

66
00:03:40.714 --> 00:03:41.855
Okay.

67
00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:53.165
Be careful.

68
00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:01.045
Where are we?

69
00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:02.144
What do you think?

70
00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:03.505
We're at your home.

71
00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:05.345
Why are we here?

72
00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:07.915
Why? To go to sleep.

73
00:04:09.084 --> 00:04:10.084
Sleep?

74
00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:14.554
Are we sleeping together?

75
00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:15.954
No, just you.

76
00:04:16.424 --> 00:04:17.424
I see.

77
00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:20.095
- Wait. - What?

78
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:21.364
You're sober.

79
00:04:21.364 --> 00:04:23.564
No, I'm not.

80
00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:24.734
You idiot.

81
00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:29.504
That hurt.

82
00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:31.874
Are you hurt?

83
00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:33.674
I'm hurt too.

84
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:39.814
I can't let you get hurt,

85
00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:42.114
Ms. Jang.

86
00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:55.465
Ms. Jang.

87
00:04:57.194 --> 00:04:58.194
Yes?

88
00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:01.765
Ms. Jang.

89
00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:04.504
What?

90
00:05:06.674 --> 00:05:08.345
Ms. Jang.

91
00:05:11.845 --> 00:05:12.845
What?

92
00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:33.965
Come on, wake up.

93
00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:37.364
Kim Min Joon.

94
00:05:58.655 --> 00:05:59.754
Where are we?

95
00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:00.895
What do you think?

96
00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:02.265
We're at your home.

97
00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.025
Why are we here?

98
00:06:04.795 --> 00:06:06.595
Why? To go to sleep.

99
00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.295
Oh, my gosh! Get lost!

100
00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.295
Will you get lost?

101
00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:42.734
Get lost.

102
00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:43.965
This is unbelievable.

103
00:06:45.874 --> 00:06:47.744
My gosh, come on.

104
00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:50.775
I spent the night here to protect you.

105
00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:53.074
So why on earth would you protect me?

106
00:06:53.074 --> 00:06:55.085
Goodness, you two are way too noisy.

107
00:06:55.085 --> 00:06:57.754
You're the one who left me with this beast?

108
00:06:57.754 --> 00:06:59.855
Did you two beasts have a lot of fun?

109
00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:03.525
Mr. Kim, your bed was really comfortable.

110
00:07:05.924 --> 00:07:06.955
Where's Pentium?

111
00:07:07.624 --> 00:07:10.064
It's already mid-day. Is he still asleep?

112
00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:11.434
Noo Ri!

113
00:07:11.434 --> 00:07:13.395
Noo Ri is taking some time off.

114
00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:15.004
What? Why?

115
00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:16.364
Family affair.

116
00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:18.374
Family?

117
00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:20.705
Pentium has a family?

118
00:07:21.405 --> 00:07:22.504
Wait.

119
00:07:23.645 --> 00:07:25.015
Members of Mad Dog,

120
00:07:25.515 --> 00:07:27.015
I think you should take a look at this.

121
00:07:27.074 --> 00:07:30.015
Recently, we have grieved our dear customers...

122
00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:33.684
of Taeyang Insurance for the trouble...

123
00:07:33.684 --> 00:07:36.254
which recently took place.

124
00:07:36.754 --> 00:07:38.424
We truly apologize for...

125
00:07:38.694 --> 00:07:42.324
delaying the payment of rightful claims,

126
00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:44.165
and for not informing...

127
00:07:44.494 --> 00:07:48.035
the ways to retrieve dormant claims.

128
00:07:48.064 --> 00:07:49.934
We sincerely apologize.

129
00:07:50.665 --> 00:07:51.775
Above all,

130
00:07:51.975 --> 00:07:55.174
we understand the financial damages...

131
00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:58.215
you received from unpaid rightful claims.

132
00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:00.545
We promise...

133
00:08:00.884 --> 00:08:02.915
to compensate according to procedures.

134
00:08:03.585 --> 00:08:04.785
As a part of the management,

135
00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:07.015
I sincerely apologize and hold the responsibility.

136
00:08:07.285 --> 00:08:09.725
On behalf of the entire management,

137
00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:13.924
we would like to apologize once again.

138
00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:32.915
(Executive Director Cha Hong Joo)

139
00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:40.184
Yes?

140
00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:41.224
How was it?

141
00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.084
How did it feel to bow down?

142
00:08:43.454 --> 00:08:46.295
Isn't it better to take care of things with money?

143
00:08:47.865 --> 00:08:49.824
I'm sure this isn't why you called.

144
00:08:49.824 --> 00:08:52.135
It is. I was wondering...

145
00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:53.535
how you were doing.

146
00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:55.204
Mr. Joo Hyun Ki.

147
00:08:55.204 --> 00:08:57.674
I prepared a gift for you to make you feel better.

148
00:08:57.735 --> 00:08:59.235
Don't be too excited.

149
00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:03.074
A gift?

150
00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:08.415
Excuse me for making a call in the middle.

151
00:09:10.314 --> 00:09:11.814
Vice President Joo,

152
00:09:12.115 --> 00:09:13.954
based on your phone conversation,

153
00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:16.554
you sound like a silly man.

154
00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:19.724
That's why you can't judge by appearance.

155
00:09:21.765 --> 00:09:23.525
Who would've known?

156
00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:25.464
Who would've thought a very strict...

157
00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:28.434
Chief of Seoul Prosecutors' Office...

158
00:09:29.604 --> 00:09:32.405
would have a son like that?

159
00:09:33.834 --> 00:09:37.275
You put your son aside safely, right?

160
00:09:53.895 --> 00:09:56.895
I need to give someone a gift.

161
00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:02.564
So you should start catching the dog.

162
00:10:06.174 --> 00:10:08.604
They must be going in by now.

163
00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:14.385
(On Noo Ri)

164
00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:16.415
I just got caught.

165
00:10:20.084 --> 00:10:22.125
The prosecution will rush in soon.

166
00:10:22.924 --> 00:10:24.025
What?

167
00:10:24.495 --> 00:10:26.224
The prosecution will be here?

168
00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:28.824
Why? They should investigate Taeyang.

169
00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:30.895
Chief On of Seoul Prosecutors' Office,

170
00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.064
Noo Ri's father,

171
00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:33.365
will be onto us.

172
00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.265
Wait a minute.

173
00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:36.905
Who is Noo Ri's father?

174
00:10:36.905 --> 00:10:38.334
The Chief of Seoul Prosecutors' Office?

175
00:10:38.334 --> 00:10:40.474
You guys must act like you didn't do anything.

176
00:10:40.474 --> 00:10:42.745
Just tell them I did everything.

177
00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:44.515
You did everything.

178
00:10:44.515 --> 00:10:45.714
Not us.

179
00:10:46.074 --> 00:10:47.785
Mr. Choi and Ms. Jang.

180
00:10:47.785 --> 00:10:49.545
What are you two doing?

181
00:10:50.245 --> 00:10:51.655
Are you Choi Kang Woo?

182
00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:54.155
Yes, I am.

183
00:10:54.184 --> 00:10:56.454
We're from Seoul Prosecutors' Office.

184
00:10:56.724 --> 00:10:58.025
(Search and seizure warrant)

185
00:10:58.025 --> 00:10:59.694
You're under arrest for...

186
00:10:59.694 --> 00:11:01.125
intrusion of Taeyang Insurance...

187
00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:02.924
Head Office in Seoul,

188
00:11:02.924 --> 00:11:04.464
special larceny, and breaking...

189
00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:05.995
communications privacy act...

190
00:11:05.995 --> 00:11:07.934
and information network law.

191
00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.464
What did you just say?

192
00:11:09.704 --> 00:11:11.005
Special larceny?

193
00:11:11.005 --> 00:11:12.334
What are you doing?

194
00:11:17.674 --> 00:11:20.375
Jang Ha Ri, Park Soon Jung, Jan Gebauer.

195
00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:22.985
Please come with me as witnesses.

196
00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:25.314
- Take him away. - Yes, sir.

197
00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:49.474
Father.

198
00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:56.385
Your younger sister, Na Ra...

199
00:11:56.385 --> 00:11:58.454
has passed the first round of law school exam.

200
00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:01.785
You've always been like that since you were born.

201
00:12:01.885 --> 00:12:03.655
You'd always stay low,

202
00:12:03.885 --> 00:12:05.155
but at an important moment,

203
00:12:05.155 --> 00:12:06.755
you would get up...

204
00:12:06.755 --> 00:12:07.924
and ruin everything.

205
00:12:09.865 --> 00:12:11.694
- Father. - Don't call me.

206
00:12:11.795 --> 00:12:12.995
I told you.

207
00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:15.535
You aren't a member of my family.

208
00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:17.064
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:25.174
Put him where there is no internet.

210
00:12:25.174 --> 00:12:26.214
Yes, sir.

211
00:12:31.554 --> 00:12:32.915
Please give me your phone.

212
00:12:55.804 --> 00:12:59.074
Gosh, why is there so much evidence?

213
00:13:00.344 --> 00:13:02.684
The civil complaints flooding the Financial...

214
00:13:02.684 --> 00:13:04.885
Supervisory Service and other websites...

215
00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:08.084
were all caused by you and the IP address proves it.

216
00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.625
Proof and witnesses of your intrusion into...

217
00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:14.295
Taeyang head office have been secured already.

218
00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:15.964
I did all of that.

219
00:13:16.324 --> 00:13:18.395
Considering the size of the crime,

220
00:13:18.395 --> 00:13:20.194
it couldn't have been done alone.

221
00:13:20.194 --> 00:13:21.934
I did it all on my own.

222
00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:24.775
I didn't do anything.

223
00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:27.405
I refuse to make a statement.

224
00:13:27.844 --> 00:13:28.875
Ma'am.

225
00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:31.444
This is an investigation of a witness.

226
00:13:31.515 --> 00:13:33.574
If you don't talk, it'll get more complicated.

227
00:13:36.285 --> 00:13:37.684
Then I'll let it get more complicated.

228
00:13:38.054 --> 00:13:39.214
Mr. Prosecutor.

229
00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:42.285
I've been in jail five times already.

230
00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:44.755
Do you think I'd want to serve again?

231
00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:47.495
I didn't do anything.

232
00:13:48.464 --> 00:13:50.194
Mr. Park Soon Jung.

233
00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:53.395
You lived in that office...

234
00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:54.905
called Mad Dog.

235
00:13:54.905 --> 00:13:56.834
Like a hibernating bear,

236
00:13:57.064 --> 00:13:59.875
I only slept there.

237
00:14:00.574 --> 00:14:03.174
Anyway, call me a lawyer.

238
00:14:03.174 --> 00:14:04.375
A lawyer?

239
00:14:05.015 --> 00:14:06.415
This is an investigation of a witness.

240
00:14:06.415 --> 00:14:07.714
This is frustrating.

241
00:14:08.415 --> 00:14:10.485
I'm an ex-convict, so I know things.

242
00:14:10.854 --> 00:14:12.385
I can be accompanied by a lawyer...

243
00:14:12.385 --> 00:14:14.224
during an investigation of a witness.

244
00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:16.255
Call me my lawyer.

245
00:14:16.885 --> 00:14:19.025
I don't speak Korean.

246
00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:20.694
I'm German.

247
00:14:21.064 --> 00:14:24.064
Look. Mr. Jan Gebauer.

248
00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:26.434
Just speak in Korean.

249
00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.905
I know you had an interview...

250
00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:31.074
with Reporter Bang Jin Seok in Korean.

251
00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:33.535
Do you know this song?

252
00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:36.104
Koreans love it.

253
00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:50.054
Everyone is saying you did it alone.

254
00:14:50.184 --> 00:14:52.025
Because I did.

255
00:14:54.724 --> 00:14:57.365
I did it alone.

256
00:14:58.295 --> 00:14:59.594
Everyone should leave the room.

257
00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:01.934
And...

258
00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:04.174
tell Prosecutor Kim to get out too.

259
00:15:04.434 --> 00:15:05.474
Pardon?

260
00:15:09.405 --> 00:15:10.444
Yes, sir.

261
00:15:16.285 --> 00:15:18.214
(Seoul Prosecutors' Office)

262
00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:27.995
It's nice to meet you,

263
00:15:29.165 --> 00:15:31.194
Chief On Joo Sik.

264
00:15:34.094 --> 00:15:36.505
You're saying it was all you.

265
00:15:36.765 --> 00:15:38.934
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been arrested alone.

266
00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:43.804
Tell me why you didn't arrest...

267
00:15:45.174 --> 00:15:46.415
everyone in my team.

268
00:15:46.814 --> 00:15:48.115
I'm...

269
00:15:49.485 --> 00:15:51.854
getting tired of Taeyang...

270
00:15:51.854 --> 00:15:53.285
and JH Group.

271
00:15:54.485 --> 00:15:56.924
Will you be able to help me?

272
00:15:57.125 --> 00:15:58.755
How can I be of help,

273
00:15:59.655 --> 00:16:00.895
Chief On?

274
00:16:08.434 --> 00:16:10.635
(Mad Dog: Help Me)

275
00:16:12.334 --> 00:16:15.145
Chief On arrested Kang Woo and the gang...

276
00:16:15.145 --> 00:16:16.474
and released them right away.

277
00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:17.875
Yes, sir.

278
00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:19.714
Vice President Joo said...

279
00:16:19.714 --> 00:16:22.184
Chief On agreed to hold them for 48 hours.

280
00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:24.255
I'm not sure what went wrong.

281
00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:28.854
Hyun Ki got off on the wrong foot.

282
00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.924
I told him not to harm family members.

283
00:16:33.454 --> 00:16:36.025
I know he never felt father's love,

284
00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:38.535
but why doesn't he know family always comes first?

285
00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:40.865
(Chief On Joo Sik)

286
00:16:55.344 --> 00:16:59.054
Your call is being forwarded to a voice...

287
00:17:00.255 --> 00:17:03.184
Those sons of...

288
00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:09.265
That's right.

289
00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:13.164
They're dogs.

290
00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:39.354
So...

291
00:17:39.795 --> 00:17:41.564
what will happen now?

292
00:17:41.564 --> 00:17:43.324
Tell me, Mr. Choi.

293
00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:45.594
Chief On contacted Noo Ri...

294
00:17:45.594 --> 00:17:46.965
last night and told him...

295
00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.364
to stay away from us.

296
00:17:49.005 --> 00:17:50.604
He told me to leave right away.

297
00:17:50.604 --> 00:17:53.175
He said he'd arrest you and the others.

298
00:17:53.435 --> 00:17:54.445
Noo Ri.

299
00:17:54.445 --> 00:17:56.804
But it's weird, Mr. Choi.

300
00:17:57.304 --> 00:18:00.114
He can just lock me up in a sanitarium.

301
00:18:00.475 --> 00:18:02.685
But this time, he's saying he'll arrest us.

302
00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:05.614
I believe Chief On...

303
00:18:05.614 --> 00:18:07.015
needs us.

304
00:18:10.185 --> 00:18:11.525
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

305
00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:14.364
I think Mad Dog got caught because of me.

306
00:18:20.064 --> 00:18:21.205
No, Noo Ri.

307
00:18:21.205 --> 00:18:22.765
We'll take care of ourselves.

308
00:18:22.765 --> 00:18:24.435
You better run away quickly.

309
00:18:24.435 --> 00:18:26.735
No, I should get caught,

310
00:18:27.035 --> 00:18:28.445
so my dad can rest easy.

311
00:18:28.445 --> 00:18:29.945
Hey, if you get caught,

312
00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:31.414
you can't come out again easily.

313
00:18:31.414 --> 00:18:32.844
I'm not alone anymore.

314
00:18:34.215 --> 00:18:35.844
Please tell Cheetah...

315
00:18:36.314 --> 00:18:37.884
to find me no matter what.

316
00:18:38.054 --> 00:18:39.614
Why should I find him?

317
00:18:41.084 --> 00:18:42.255
That brat.

318
00:18:43.285 --> 00:18:44.354
We spent two years together,

319
00:18:44.354 --> 00:18:46.455
but he never told me anything about his father.

320
00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:48.394
So?

321
00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:51.465
What does Chief On want?

322
00:18:51.594 --> 00:18:52.965
He wants something that won't let...

323
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.965
Taeyang and JH Group have influence on him.

324
00:18:55.164 --> 00:18:57.705
I gave him something for Taeyang already.

325
00:18:57.705 --> 00:18:58.775
Wait a second.

326
00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:00.435
Did you...

327
00:19:00.804 --> 00:19:03.545
give him the photo of the original insurance policy?

328
00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:06.614
There seems to be what Vice President Joo...

329
00:19:06.614 --> 00:19:10.314
is looking for among the things we confiscated.

330
00:19:11.054 --> 00:19:12.114
What's that?

331
00:19:12.255 --> 00:19:13.914
It's the video of...

332
00:19:13.914 --> 00:19:15.425
the original insurance policy...

333
00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:16.725
that belongs to the assistant pilot,

334
00:19:16.925 --> 00:19:18.725
Kim Bum Joon who committed a suicide plane crash...

335
00:19:19.054 --> 00:19:22.465
for 3.4 million dollars 2 years ago.

336
00:19:22.465 --> 00:19:24.195
The original insurance policy?

337
00:19:25.634 --> 00:19:26.634
What about it?

338
00:19:26.634 --> 00:19:28.804
According to the original policy,

339
00:19:28.804 --> 00:19:30.735
there was no way he could receive...

340
00:19:30.735 --> 00:19:32.205
3.4 million dollars.

341
00:19:41.884 --> 00:19:43.685
They fabricated the insurance policy...

342
00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:46.114
and made it look like a suicide crash?

343
00:19:46.715 --> 00:19:48.025
And the evidence is...

344
00:19:48.624 --> 00:19:50.755
one of the confiscated items?

345
00:19:52.995 --> 00:19:54.054
No,

346
00:19:56.725 --> 00:19:57.834
it's not.

347
00:20:01.205 --> 00:20:02.765
And the reason you're giving this to me?

348
00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:05.574
I know well about what kind of person you are...

349
00:20:05.775 --> 00:20:07.775
since Noo Ri told me a lot about you.

350
00:20:08.844 --> 00:20:10.445
I heard you don't know how to give up.

351
00:20:11.874 --> 00:20:13.574
You'll know if you check...

352
00:20:13.644 --> 00:20:15.985
every single item which you confiscated,

353
00:20:16.685 --> 00:20:19.114
but you won't be able to find...

354
00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.124
anything that can stop JH's influence over you.

355
00:20:21.525 --> 00:20:22.725
Taeyang Insurance's...

356
00:20:23.384 --> 00:20:25.195
Chairman Cha has it.

357
00:20:25.995 --> 00:20:27.354
The original...

358
00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:30.364
black box footage of the incident.

359
00:20:30.624 --> 00:20:31.634
Then...

360
00:20:32.035 --> 00:20:34.864
you should go get it, Mr. Kang.

361
00:20:34.864 --> 00:20:35.904
If I do,

362
00:20:36.364 --> 00:20:38.175
what will you use it for?

363
00:20:46.374 --> 00:20:47.414
Mr. Choi.

364
00:20:48.715 --> 00:20:50.045
I'm a prosecutor.

365
00:20:50.884 --> 00:20:53.814
It's to re-investigate on the Flight 801 crash...

366
00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:56.854
and reveal the truth.

367
00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:07.064
He'll re-investigate on it?

368
00:21:07.705 --> 00:21:09.765
He wants to re-investigate on the case?

369
00:21:10.265 --> 00:21:11.535
No way.

370
00:21:11.535 --> 00:21:12.675
I can't believe it.

371
00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:14.904
You can't believe it, can you?

372
00:21:14.904 --> 00:21:16.344
Of course not.

373
00:21:16.344 --> 00:21:18.114
So what shall we do? Sit back and watch?

374
00:21:18.114 --> 00:21:19.275
What do you mean?

375
00:21:20.114 --> 00:21:23.084
I thought you stopped that a long time ago.

376
00:21:24.314 --> 00:21:27.485
Then we should get the black box footage first...

377
00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:28.955
and throw it as a bait.

378
00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:30.124
How will you get it?

379
00:21:30.485 --> 00:21:32.725
We can't go into Chairman Cha's greenhouse again.

380
00:21:33.295 --> 00:21:34.925
If we can't go in,

381
00:21:35.265 --> 00:21:36.995
we can simply make him come out with it.

382
00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:38.435
Make him come out with it?

383
00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:41.164
Cha Hong Joo will become anxious...

384
00:21:41.634 --> 00:21:44.435
once she hears that the hunting has started.

385
00:21:44.435 --> 00:21:46.404
How will you let her know?

386
00:21:46.404 --> 00:21:48.574
Will you go to her directly...

387
00:21:48.574 --> 00:21:49.775
and inform her of the start?

388
00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:50.775
Shall I?

389
00:21:50.775 --> 00:21:52.074
What?

390
00:21:52.074 --> 00:21:53.644
You told me to bark loud.

391
00:21:53.914 --> 00:21:56.584
Shall I bark my way this time?

392
00:21:56.584 --> 00:21:58.015
Not loud enough.

393
00:21:58.015 --> 00:21:59.154
Is it?

394
00:22:01.225 --> 00:22:03.925
By the way, why isn't Ms. Jang here yet?

395
00:22:04.955 --> 00:22:06.195
Where's she?

396
00:22:20.475 --> 00:22:21.675
Why are you shaking?

397
00:22:21.675 --> 00:22:23.374
We're surrounded by people here.

398
00:22:24.644 --> 00:22:27.045
Are you worried I might do something to you?

399
00:22:27.344 --> 00:22:29.445
Get straight to the point.

400
00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:34.624
Well, it's not anything serious.

401
00:22:35.185 --> 00:22:37.354
I want you to help me with something.

402
00:22:37.925 --> 00:22:38.925
Why should I?

403
00:22:38.925 --> 00:22:39.955
What do you mean?

404
00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:41.425
You disguised yourself as a curator...

405
00:22:41.425 --> 00:22:43.725
and intruded my house illegally.

406
00:22:44.394 --> 00:22:46.435
Do you have proof?

407
00:22:46.435 --> 00:22:48.535
No, I don't.

408
00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:51.775
I take my private life very seriously,

409
00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:54.205
so I don't have any CCTVs installed in my house.

410
00:22:54.574 --> 00:22:56.404
I'm worried the housekeepers might...

411
00:22:56.745 --> 00:22:57.914
leak the footages and run away.

412
00:23:03.985 --> 00:23:06.084
You want to know what kind of private life it is?

413
00:23:07.584 --> 00:23:08.725
Do you want me to tell you?

414
00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.394
No, thanks. If you have nothing more to say,

415
00:23:11.394 --> 00:23:12.695
I'll leave first.

416
00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:14.124
There's no CCTV,

417
00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:19.435
but my housekeepers have eyes.

418
00:23:24.975 --> 00:23:26.005
Don't you remember...

419
00:23:26.834 --> 00:23:29.644
the housemaid who was at my house then?

420
00:23:29.644 --> 00:23:31.114
Even if she saw me...

421
00:23:31.114 --> 00:23:32.374
It wouldn't be a problem...

422
00:23:32.374 --> 00:23:34.185
if she saw only you.

423
00:23:35.814 --> 00:23:38.084
But what if she says she saw you...

424
00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:39.614
as well as Kim Bum Joon's brother, Jan Gebauer?

425
00:23:39.614 --> 00:23:40.785
What will happen then?

426
00:23:45.695 --> 00:23:47.094
"The brother of the assistant pilot..."

427
00:23:47.094 --> 00:23:48.495
"who crashed the plane intruded..."

428
00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:51.094
"the house of Juhan Air's vice president."

429
00:23:51.364 --> 00:23:53.564
And you're his accomplice.

430
00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:56.164
My goodness.

431
00:23:57.574 --> 00:23:59.804
What an enticing story. Don't you agree?

432
00:24:05.114 --> 00:24:06.715
(Mr. Kim)

433
00:24:09.285 --> 00:24:10.785
Is it Kim Bum Joon's brother?

434
00:24:11.914 --> 00:24:13.255
Take it, Ms. Jang.

435
00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:20.995
Ms. Jang.

436
00:24:22.324 --> 00:24:23.465
Answer your phone.

437
00:24:25.495 --> 00:24:26.935
Answer it.

438
00:24:27.505 --> 00:24:29.064
The person you've dialed isn't available...

439
00:24:29.064 --> 00:24:32.304
at the moment. Leave a message after the beep.

440
00:24:35.844 --> 00:24:38.015
How could you send her alone to face Joo Hyun Ki?

441
00:24:38.775 --> 00:24:39.914
What on earth...

442
00:24:40.175 --> 00:24:41.844
were you thinking?

443
00:24:41.844 --> 00:24:43.114
Goodness.

444
00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:47.314
She'll be all right. You told me to trust her.

445
00:24:47.314 --> 00:24:49.824
And you sent her to a death place?

446
00:24:50.384 --> 00:24:52.654
Don't you know what kind of person Joo Hyun Ki is?

447
00:24:53.554 --> 00:24:55.824
I'm going for her right now.

448
00:24:57.735 --> 00:24:58.995
Kim Min Joon.

449
00:24:59.735 --> 00:25:02.505
Thanks in advance, Ms. Jang.

450
00:25:25.225 --> 00:25:26.354
Mr. Kim.

451
00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:27.925
How did you know I was here?

452
00:25:29.324 --> 00:25:31.035
Did you attach a tracker on me?

453
00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:32.164
Are you out of your mind?

454
00:25:32.164 --> 00:25:34.134
That's what I want to ask.

455
00:25:35.064 --> 00:25:36.205
I told you.

456
00:25:36.205 --> 00:25:38.404
I can't let Joo Hyun Ki chase after you.

457
00:25:38.834 --> 00:25:40.235
And you went to him yourself...

458
00:25:40.235 --> 00:25:42.775
and offered yourself to him?

459
00:25:42.775 --> 00:25:44.275
What are you talking about?

460
00:25:44.275 --> 00:25:46.175
He called me first.

461
00:25:46.175 --> 00:25:48.185
You should've avoided getting involved with him.

462
00:25:48.185 --> 00:25:50.955
Right, I shouldn't have gotten involved with this.

463
00:25:50.955 --> 00:25:52.554
When you walked in our office...

464
00:25:52.554 --> 00:25:53.654
and suggested a ridiculous bet,

465
00:25:53.654 --> 00:25:55.455
saying you'd take over Mad Dog if you won,

466
00:25:55.685 --> 00:25:58.455
we should've avoided getting involved with you.

467
00:25:58.995 --> 00:26:01.765
- What? - Why couldn't you think?

468
00:26:02.064 --> 00:26:04.795
Look what happened to Park Soon Jung,

469
00:26:05.195 --> 00:26:07.804
On Noo Ri, and me who have nothing to do with you.

470
00:26:10.935 --> 00:26:13.505
Don't try to be considerate now, Mr. Kim.

471
00:26:14.104 --> 00:26:16.045
You're the one who offered us...

472
00:26:17.045 --> 00:26:18.314
to them.

473
00:26:45.374 --> 00:26:46.404
Secretary Han.

474
00:26:47.604 --> 00:26:49.144
Do you think...

475
00:26:49.604 --> 00:26:52.314
emotions are humans' weakness or not?

476
00:26:52.745 --> 00:26:54.515
I'm not quite emotional these days,

477
00:26:55.545 --> 00:26:56.814
so I'm not sure.

478
00:26:56.814 --> 00:26:58.215
What do you know?

479
00:26:59.185 --> 00:27:01.025
What's in your brain?

480
00:27:01.025 --> 00:27:02.154
It must be so clean and empty.

481
00:27:04.824 --> 00:27:05.925
Let's go.

482
00:27:06.195 --> 00:27:07.195
Yes, sir.

483
00:27:16.705 --> 00:27:17.834
Why aren't you eating?

484
00:27:18.675 --> 00:27:20.945
Yellow tail is totally in season.

485
00:27:20.945 --> 00:27:22.175
Try some.

486
00:27:22.175 --> 00:27:23.904
There's a video...

487
00:27:24.715 --> 00:27:26.275
of the original insurance policy.

488
00:27:26.675 --> 00:27:28.485
And I have it in my hands.

489
00:27:28.515 --> 00:27:30.445
So that's what they stole.

490
00:27:30.445 --> 00:27:31.455
Good job.

491
00:27:31.455 --> 00:27:33.755
It might ruin your reputation...

492
00:27:34.354 --> 00:27:38.025
if it gets out to the public.

493
00:27:38.025 --> 00:27:39.154
It won't.

494
00:27:40.124 --> 00:27:41.364
It's all fake.

495
00:27:41.364 --> 00:27:42.564
Whether it's a footage or copy,

496
00:27:42.564 --> 00:27:43.624
it's not the original.

497
00:27:43.624 --> 00:27:47.094
Still, it might cause a ruckus...

498
00:27:47.094 --> 00:27:48.564
if the public finds out about it.

499
00:27:48.564 --> 00:27:50.804
A ruckus within those ignorant people?

500
00:27:53.574 --> 00:27:54.874
I just need to...

501
00:27:57.045 --> 00:27:58.314
cover their eyes.

502
00:27:59.175 --> 00:28:00.275
Chief On,

503
00:28:00.574 --> 00:28:02.914
you're a great man who'll be leading...

504
00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:04.114
our country in the future.

505
00:28:04.114 --> 00:28:06.114
You shouldn't be bothered by such a tiny matter.

506
00:28:06.114 --> 00:28:08.154
Take more care of your health instead.

507
00:28:08.285 --> 00:28:09.485
Go ahead and eat.

508
00:28:10.384 --> 00:28:12.925
I'm just thinking that your succession...

509
00:28:13.455 --> 00:28:15.525
of the business management...

510
00:28:15.525 --> 00:28:18.495
should be settled as soon as possible.

511
00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:21.604
I think that was the problem.

512
00:28:21.864 --> 00:28:24.134
I wanted to settle the issue quietly and quickly,

513
00:28:24.134 --> 00:28:26.574
and it led the dogs...

514
00:28:26.804 --> 00:28:28.104
and Taeyang...

515
00:28:28.945 --> 00:28:30.275
to step in our company.

516
00:28:32.144 --> 00:28:33.144
Anyway,

517
00:28:33.515 --> 00:28:34.914
Special Investigation Team Two won't...

518
00:28:34.914 --> 00:28:36.215
barge into JH,

519
00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:38.285
so I'm going to take it slow.

520
00:28:38.285 --> 00:28:39.884
Do you not think...

521
00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:41.985
Special Investigation Team Two won't get JH?

522
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:45.054
How's your son doing?

523
00:28:46.025 --> 00:28:48.225
Take care of him no matter where he is.

524
00:28:48.795 --> 00:28:50.324
You might have abandoned him,

525
00:28:50.935 --> 00:28:52.465
but he's still your son.

526
00:28:56.505 --> 00:28:57.604
Have some.

527
00:28:58.435 --> 00:29:00.634
You need to stay healthy to protect...

528
00:29:00.634 --> 00:29:02.374
Korea and your son for a long time.

529
00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:08.445
Are you saying Joo Hyun Ki...

530
00:29:08.584 --> 00:29:09.785
told us to find Pentium...

531
00:29:09.785 --> 00:29:11.485
and then bring him out with us?

532
00:29:11.485 --> 00:29:12.485
Yes.

533
00:29:12.685 --> 00:29:14.925
Chief On wouldn't budge...

534
00:29:15.324 --> 00:29:17.225
according to his plan,

535
00:29:17.654 --> 00:29:19.295
so I guess he needs Noo Ri.

536
00:29:19.654 --> 00:29:21.164
I think it'd be a better idea...

537
00:29:21.295 --> 00:29:23.094
to not look for Pentium.

538
00:29:23.664 --> 00:29:24.935
What do you mean?

539
00:29:25.235 --> 00:29:26.435
Pentium is waiting for us...

540
00:29:27.035 --> 00:29:29.104
No, he's waiting for me.

541
00:29:29.664 --> 00:29:31.334
And what about you, Ha Ri?

542
00:29:31.735 --> 00:29:34.475
I can clearly tell Joo Hyun Ki isn't sane.

543
00:29:34.644 --> 00:29:36.005
We need to look like...

544
00:29:36.005 --> 00:29:37.475
we're doing something to deceive him.

545
00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:39.515
Then what if Noo Ri gets in danger?

546
00:29:39.675 --> 00:29:41.114
That'll be our fault.

547
00:29:41.114 --> 00:29:42.715
That's not anyone's fault.

548
00:29:42.715 --> 00:29:44.114
No one will blame you for that.

549
00:29:45.015 --> 00:29:46.785
Family members don't blame each other.

550
00:29:48.854 --> 00:29:50.354
This isn't what a family should do.

551
00:29:50.354 --> 00:29:51.624
Aren't we a family?

552
00:29:52.695 --> 00:29:53.894
We are.

553
00:29:57.394 --> 00:29:58.795
Thanks, Soon Jung.

554
00:30:01.164 --> 00:30:02.564
Thanks, Cheetah.

555
00:30:03.035 --> 00:30:04.604
What?

556
00:30:05.775 --> 00:30:08.045
What did I do?

557
00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:22.654
I have a bad case of sun allergy,

558
00:30:22.654 --> 00:30:24.295
so I really need my hat.

559
00:30:24.624 --> 00:30:27.054
It's probably with my stuff.

560
00:30:27.154 --> 00:30:29.564
Give me a second. I'll let the doctor know.

561
00:30:29.695 --> 00:30:30.765
Okay.

562
00:30:43.904 --> 00:30:45.644
Follow me, Cheetah.

563
00:30:47.715 --> 00:30:49.344
You need to follow me well.

564
00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:56.884
I have Pentium's location, Ha Ri.

565
00:30:59.495 --> 00:31:00.695
Let's go.

566
00:31:00.695 --> 00:31:01.894
What about Mr. Kim?

567
00:31:02.624 --> 00:31:03.795
What about Kim Min Joon?

568
00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:06.495
Mr. Choi told us to make sure we bring him.

569
00:31:13.035 --> 00:31:14.874
Paju, Gyeonggi Province.

570
00:31:14.945 --> 00:31:17.445
What are you doing here, Pentium?

571
00:31:17.574 --> 00:31:19.574
There's a mental hospital nearby.

572
00:31:19.574 --> 00:31:20.644
How could he...

573
00:31:20.644 --> 00:31:22.414
lock up his own son in a mental hospital?

574
00:31:22.485 --> 00:31:25.154
What kind of a father is he?

575
00:31:25.154 --> 00:31:28.324
Is money and power that important?

576
00:31:34.495 --> 00:31:36.164
Oh, gosh, I'm so sleepy.

577
00:31:36.265 --> 00:31:37.664
I need to get some sleep.

578
00:31:37.664 --> 00:31:40.035
Mr. Kim, you can't fall asleep.

579
00:31:40.035 --> 00:31:41.965
- Why not? - You need to keep...

580
00:31:41.965 --> 00:31:44.604
Ha Ri up, and give her something to drink too.

581
00:31:44.604 --> 00:31:46.304
Will you be quiet?

582
00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:48.005
Okay.

583
00:32:00.854 --> 00:32:02.285
I'm not thirsty.

584
00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.594
Come on, Ms. Jag.

585
00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:10.564
"Tschuldigung."

586
00:32:11.364 --> 00:32:13.064
What did you just say?

587
00:32:13.664 --> 00:32:15.465
Doesn't that mean "I'm sorry"?

588
00:32:15.465 --> 00:32:18.705
Ms. Jang, did you just speak in German?

589
00:32:19.205 --> 00:32:21.344
You aren't the only one who can speak German.

590
00:32:22.644 --> 00:32:24.715
You looked up the word.

591
00:32:24.715 --> 00:32:25.945
I didn't.

592
00:32:25.945 --> 00:32:27.445
I just took a guess.

593
00:32:27.515 --> 00:32:29.584
There's tissue in the glove compartment.

594
00:32:36.455 --> 00:32:38.094
I'm taking my stuff back.

595
00:32:38.455 --> 00:32:39.554
No, you can't.

596
00:32:41.495 --> 00:32:42.594
I haven't washed it.

597
00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:45.495
Gosh, Ms. Jang. You're gross.

598
00:32:45.495 --> 00:32:47.265
I've been busy because of someone.

599
00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:49.104
I had no time to do my laundry.

600
00:32:54.404 --> 00:32:55.574
Why are you moving away?

601
00:32:55.574 --> 00:32:56.904
These are new.

602
00:32:57.404 --> 00:32:58.644
I don't think so.

603
00:32:58.644 --> 00:33:00.144
Hey, Kim Min Joon.

604
00:33:06.015 --> 00:33:07.824
I finished investigating Cho Ha Eun's...

605
00:33:07.824 --> 00:33:08.955
200,000 dollars claim and other unpaid claims...

606
00:33:08.955 --> 00:33:10.255
of one million dollars.

607
00:33:10.525 --> 00:33:11.654
And our conclusion is...

608
00:33:11.654 --> 00:33:13.425
that it's right to process their claims.

609
00:33:13.695 --> 00:33:16.124
Okay, process them.

610
00:33:18.535 --> 00:33:20.064
Assistant Manager Park.

611
00:33:21.705 --> 00:33:23.304
You must be disappointed in me.

612
00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:25.675
What do you mean?

613
00:33:25.705 --> 00:33:27.705
I demoted you as an assistant manager,

614
00:33:28.574 --> 00:33:30.844
yet I made you do all the dirty works.

615
00:33:31.715 --> 00:33:34.314
You probably began to feel skeptical about work.

616
00:33:35.414 --> 00:33:36.515
Director Cha.

617
00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.755
I'm a claims examiner.

618
00:33:39.054 --> 00:33:41.124
And I worked for Taeyang for the last 16 years.

619
00:33:41.985 --> 00:33:44.394
I plan on remaining at Taeyang Insurance...

620
00:33:44.394 --> 00:33:45.525
to process rightful claims,

621
00:33:45.525 --> 00:33:47.094
and to prohibit paying wrongful claims.

622
00:33:47.664 --> 00:33:49.094
That's my job,

623
00:33:49.094 --> 00:33:50.425
and that's what an insurance company does.

624
00:33:51.094 --> 00:33:52.564
I will process this right away.

625
00:33:57.834 --> 00:33:59.074
That's what...

626
00:34:01.505 --> 00:34:02.574
an insurance company does.

627
00:34:07.045 --> 00:34:09.284
(Kang Woo)

628
00:34:20.965 --> 00:34:22.695
You came around faster than I thought.

629
00:34:22.695 --> 00:34:23.795
Are you disappointed?

630
00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:24.965
Disappointed?

631
00:34:25.095 --> 00:34:27.264
I don't think we share such feelings.

632
00:34:27.264 --> 00:34:29.564
I thought that was the case, but it wasn't.

633
00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:31.434
We were family.

634
00:34:32.405 --> 00:34:33.505
Family?

635
00:34:34.345 --> 00:34:36.905
Since when were you and I family?

636
00:34:37.104 --> 00:34:38.845
You were family to me.

637
00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:41.715
You were a great sister and a great aunt...

638
00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:44.615
to Mi Sook and Ju Won as well.

639
00:34:44.954 --> 00:34:46.514
That's why I was always grateful.

640
00:34:47.655 --> 00:34:50.624
If you want to talk about the past, I'm leaving.

641
00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:51.894
Flight 801.

642
00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:55.825
Was there a problem with the aircraft?

643
00:34:57.735 --> 00:34:59.994
What was on the black box?

644
00:35:00.795 --> 00:35:02.405
The fact that the aircraft was worn out...

645
00:35:02.564 --> 00:35:04.405
and couldn't reach the control tower.

646
00:35:04.775 --> 00:35:07.775
Were they all recorded on the black box?

647
00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:12.314
I have no idea what you're saying.

648
00:35:12.474 --> 00:35:13.545
Okay.

649
00:35:14.184 --> 00:35:15.345
You couldn't have known.

650
00:35:15.345 --> 00:35:16.615
There's no way.

651
00:35:17.045 --> 00:35:18.385
If you knew,

652
00:35:18.385 --> 00:35:20.715
you wouldn't have approved their insurance renewal.

653
00:35:23.724 --> 00:35:25.025
You wouldn't have let...

654
00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:27.224
Mi Sook and Ju Won...

655
00:35:27.664 --> 00:35:29.564
get on the plane knowing that.

656
00:35:31.764 --> 00:35:33.334
You were our family.

657
00:35:35.204 --> 00:35:36.405
If you...

658
00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:39.075
If you did it knowing that...

659
00:35:39.075 --> 00:35:40.175
I didn't know.

660
00:35:41.505 --> 00:35:42.545
Okay.

661
00:35:43.845 --> 00:35:45.175
I'm sure you didn't know.

662
00:35:47.215 --> 00:35:48.385
You didn't know.

663
00:35:54.255 --> 00:35:55.255
What are you doing?

664
00:35:55.684 --> 00:35:57.494
Are you recording this conversation?

665
00:35:57.494 --> 00:35:58.555
Why would I do that?

666
00:35:58.555 --> 00:35:59.755
Then what are you doing?

667
00:35:59.755 --> 00:36:02.425
I'm looking for the person who caused the accident.

668
00:36:03.764 --> 00:36:06.264
Forging Kim Bum Joon's insurance policy?

669
00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:07.604
That's nothing.

670
00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:09.704
That's probably something Chairman Cha did...

671
00:36:09.965 --> 00:36:11.834
to cover up the accident after it happened.

672
00:36:12.974 --> 00:36:14.874
The one we must take down is...

673
00:36:15.345 --> 00:36:17.045
the one who let the weak aircraft fly,

674
00:36:18.275 --> 00:36:19.575
Joo Hyun Ki.

675
00:36:24.914 --> 00:36:26.985
You can't catch Joo Hyun Ki.

676
00:36:26.985 --> 00:36:28.084
No.

677
00:36:28.084 --> 00:36:30.354
You and Chairman Cha can't.

678
00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:33.994
Two companies are involved in a weird relationship,

679
00:36:35.365 --> 00:36:37.865
like succeeding the management rights.

680
00:36:41.405 --> 00:36:44.434
So Hong Joo, I'll get him for us.

681
00:36:45.034 --> 00:36:46.635
The original insurance policy...

682
00:36:46.905 --> 00:36:48.345
which Joo Hyun Ki has...

683
00:36:49.144 --> 00:36:51.215
will be testified as fake by Kim Min Joon.

684
00:36:52.144 --> 00:36:54.845
The only thing we need is for him to testify that...

685
00:36:55.184 --> 00:36:57.045
his brother took out the policy before 2010.

686
00:36:57.684 --> 00:36:59.784
That leaves no problem for Taeyang Insurance.

687
00:37:00.715 --> 00:37:03.055
Bring us the original black box.

688
00:37:04.124 --> 00:37:05.494
Then we will...

689
00:37:06.394 --> 00:37:09.494
let the world know that Flight 801 was...

690
00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:12.365
a faulty airframe.

Kim Sang Min?

694
00:37:37.454 --> 00:37:38.925
It's you, Noo Ri.

695
00:37:39.255 --> 00:37:41.624
Gosh, it's been years.

696
00:37:41.624 --> 00:37:42.965
This is the first time I see you...

697
00:37:42.965 --> 00:37:44.025
after you quit high school.

698
00:37:47.934 --> 00:37:50.604
Gosh, you're still really slow.

699
00:37:50.934 --> 00:37:54.405
And do you still go around wearing this?

700
00:37:56.045 --> 00:37:57.175
Stop it.

701
00:37:58.215 --> 00:37:59.575
I was almost...

702
00:37:59.575 --> 00:38:02.144
dying of boredom in this place.

703
00:38:03.485 --> 00:38:04.684
I'm so glad to meet you.

704
00:38:06.755 --> 00:38:08.025
I told you to stop.

705
00:38:08.985 --> 00:38:10.025
Hey.

706
00:38:10.555 --> 00:38:11.854
Do you still think...

707
00:38:11.854 --> 00:38:13.555
I'm bullying you?

708
00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:20.465
I'm only trying to help.

712

Stop acting so innocent.

Hey.

That's the second son of Banul Group.

And me.

What's your diagnosis?

I have a chronic shoulder dislocation.

Isn't it funny?

724
00:38:54.905 --> 00:38:55.934
Yes.

Of course. I'd love to.

735
00:39:29.305 --> 00:39:31.235
I need some fast cash.

736
00:39:32.175 --> 00:39:35.345
I'm very strong and fit,

737
00:39:35.345 --> 00:39:38.575
so I'm perfect for controlling acting out...

738
00:39:38.575 --> 00:39:40.575
We don't have patients like that.

739

I smell fraud.

749

What's the reason?

There are no schizophrenics.

751
00:40:07.644 --> 00:40:09.204
I've signed medical information...

protection agreement before,

753
00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.644
but I've never had a sanitarium...

754
00:40:12.644 --> 00:40:14.545
ask me to sign a confidential agreement.

755

Did you get changed?

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:17.814
Yes.

757
00:40:21.155 --> 00:40:24.025
You can't use a cellphone in a sanitarium.

758
00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:25.994
Please put it in the locker.

759
00:40:26.454 --> 00:40:27.454
Okay.

It's a sanitarium fraud case.

What do you mean all of a sudden?

769
00:40:59.655 --> 00:41:01.925
It's urgent. You need to raid the site today.

770

Stop what?

796

Don't touch my cap.

Bring us the original black box.

Then we will...

803

let the world know that Flight 801 was...

to wait until things quiet down?

812
00:43:13.224 --> 00:43:14.825
The 10 million dollars you gave me.

813
00:43:15.264 --> 00:43:16.425
You used the unpaid claims...

814
00:43:16.425 --> 00:43:18.934
and the planners' accounts as well.

Can you handle him on your own?

819

You haven't even caught the dog yet.

820
00:43:38.584 --> 00:43:40.885
It's not that I can't. I'm just not doing it.

821
00:43:41.284 --> 00:43:43.525
Because I'm planning to catch something bigger.

822

823

push Chief On down first.

852
00:45:25.795 --> 00:45:28.865
I found a few insurance claims from here.

853
00:45:28.894 --> 00:45:30.695
They're really interesting.

854
00:45:30.764 --> 00:45:32.095
How?

855
00:45:32.994 --> 00:45:35.305
Patients are all males in their 20's and 30's.

856
00:45:36.534 --> 00:45:38.204
This is up to 40 years old.

857
00:45:38.474 --> 00:45:40.604
Schizophrenia, chronic dislocation,

858
00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:42.005
herniated discs,

859
00:45:42.345 --> 00:45:43.474
epilepsy.

860
00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:44.715
You get it, right?

861
00:45:45.345 --> 00:45:46.545
Get what?

862
00:45:46.545 --> 00:45:49.445
Kim Min Joon, you've never served in the army.

863
00:45:49.744 --> 00:45:51.584
I'm a German citizen.

864
00:45:52.485 --> 00:45:54.485
So this place helps rich kids...

865
00:45:54.485 --> 00:45:56.425
get exempted from military service.

866
00:45:56.425 --> 00:45:57.425
Exactly.

867
00:45:57.425 --> 00:45:59.854
Exempted from military service? What's that?

868
00:45:59.854 --> 00:46:02.724
Those patients are bad people.

869
00:46:04.735 --> 00:46:06.534
It's 5 minutes to 9pm. Shall we go in?

870
00:46:06.534 --> 00:46:09.164
A hospital like that won't let us in.

871
00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:10.465
The police isn't with us.

872
00:46:10.465 --> 00:46:12.874
We can call the police.

873
00:46:14.445 --> 00:46:15.805
Where did you get that?

874
00:46:16.575 --> 00:46:18.314
You're still impersonating...

875
00:46:18.414 --> 00:46:20.144
It's 3 minutes to 9pm.

876
00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:21.345
Let's start.

877
00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.184
We're from Taeyang Insurance...

878
00:46:25.184 --> 00:46:26.485
Claims Examination Team.

879
00:46:28.985 --> 00:46:29.985
(Jang Ha Ri, Claims Examiner)

880
00:46:31.055 --> 00:46:32.055
Manager Park?

881
00:46:35.695 --> 00:46:36.994
I'm Manager Park Moo Shin...

882
00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:38.595
of Taeyang Insurance Claims Examination Team.

883
00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:39.994
Claims Examination Team?

884
00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:42.564
What brings you here?

885
00:46:42.635 --> 00:46:45.334
We found something odd in the claims you filed.

886
00:46:45.834 --> 00:46:47.005
Where is the director?

887
00:46:47.005 --> 00:46:48.345
The director isn't in.

888
00:46:48.345 --> 00:46:51.445
And you can't barge in here like this.

889
00:46:51.445 --> 00:46:52.545
Please leave.

890
00:46:53.474 --> 00:46:54.814
Did you just push me?

891
00:46:54.814 --> 00:46:56.485
- Pardon? - Are you okay?

892
00:46:56.485 --> 00:46:57.684
What are you doing?

893
00:46:57.684 --> 00:46:59.755
I didn't do anything.

894
00:47:01.325 --> 00:47:03.184
It's past 9pm.

895
00:47:03.284 --> 00:47:04.624
What? What's going on?

896
00:47:08.124 --> 00:47:09.724
A schizophrenic is acting out.

897
00:47:09.764 --> 00:47:11.334
He has a weapon. Hurry!

898
00:47:11.334 --> 00:47:12.334
Gosh.

899
00:47:12.834 --> 00:47:13.834
What's this?

900
00:47:14.465 --> 00:47:15.534
Pentium?

901
00:47:19.135 --> 00:47:20.275
Is this emergency service?

902
00:47:20.275 --> 00:47:22.204
This is Woonrim Sanitarium.

903
00:47:22.204 --> 00:47:23.644
Please get here quick.

904
00:47:23.644 --> 00:47:25.244
A patient got a weapon.

905
00:47:25.914 --> 00:47:28.314
Mad Dog, you crazy dogs.

906
00:47:30.184 --> 00:47:32.255
Don't come near. Stay away!

907
00:47:32.615 --> 00:47:34.084
I'll kill him if you come near!

908
00:47:35.055 --> 00:47:36.755
What? What's wrong?

909
00:47:37.655 --> 00:47:39.695
I didn't give him a scalpel to do that.

910
00:47:39.695 --> 00:47:41.365
He just went berserk.

911
00:47:43.124 --> 00:47:45.534
Pentium, calm down.

912
00:47:45.934 --> 00:47:48.104
Hey, what's wrong with you?

913
00:47:48.104 --> 00:47:49.204
I told you...

914
00:47:49.534 --> 00:47:52.735
not to touch my cap.

915
00:47:52.974 --> 00:47:54.905
Okay. Calm down.

916
00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:57.244
Is he crazy?

917
00:47:57.744 --> 00:47:59.945
He's crazy furious.

918
00:48:03.485 --> 00:48:05.914
Let's avert the attention and leave.

919
00:48:06.014 --> 00:48:07.215
What will you do?

920
00:48:07.314 --> 00:48:08.724
- You smoke, right? - Yes.

921
00:48:08.724 --> 00:48:10.055
Give me your lighter.

922
00:48:42.985 --> 00:48:44.195
We're ready.

923
00:48:44.425 --> 00:48:46.624
Don't come any closer.

924
00:48:46.724 --> 00:48:48.124
Or I'll kill this punk!

925
00:48:48.124 --> 00:48:49.425
Pentium.

926
00:48:52.595 --> 00:48:53.735
What?

927
00:48:54.434 --> 00:48:56.005
- What's going on? - What?

928
00:48:56.005 --> 00:48:58.075
Evacuate. Hurry.

929
00:48:58.474 --> 00:48:59.534
Gosh.

930
00:48:59.534 --> 00:49:01.704
- Evacuate the patients. - Hurry.

931
00:49:01.704 --> 00:49:04.005
- Hurry up. - Let's go.

932
00:49:06.215 --> 00:49:08.045
- You punk. - Cheetah.

933
00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:11.914
Hey.

934
00:49:13.414 --> 00:49:14.825
Let's talk later.

935
00:49:23.124 --> 00:49:25.365
We received a report that the hospital fabricates...

936
00:49:25.365 --> 00:49:27.764
medical diagnosis for the military duty exemption.

937
00:49:28.235 --> 00:49:29.264
What?

938
00:49:30.235 --> 00:49:31.635
Look at those patients.

939
00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.575
This is a mental sanitarium.

940
00:49:33.575 --> 00:49:35.104
But they all seem fine and sane.

941
00:49:35.244 --> 00:49:38.314
Many of the patients have a ruptured disk,

942
00:49:38.314 --> 00:49:41.615
but I saw them run down the stairs just now.

943
00:49:45.485 --> 00:49:47.485
Let's talk more inside.

944
00:49:49.155 --> 00:49:50.224
Okay.

945
00:49:50.684 --> 00:49:51.925
Pentium.

946
00:49:52.195 --> 00:49:54.394
Why don't you try seeing a psychiatrist?

947
00:49:55.365 --> 00:49:56.624
I did every time I got locked up...

948
00:49:56.624 --> 00:49:57.735
in a mental hospital.

949
00:49:58.334 --> 00:49:59.865
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia,

950
00:49:59.865 --> 00:50:01.034
a delusional disorder,

951
00:50:01.135 --> 00:50:02.334
and a histrionic personality disorder.

952
00:50:07.505 --> 00:50:08.775
Noo Ri!

953
00:50:10.204 --> 00:50:11.945
You pathetic punk.

954
00:50:12.014 --> 00:50:13.775
How dare you threaten me with a knife?

955
00:50:13.775 --> 00:50:14.784
Where do you think you're going?

956
00:50:14.784 --> 00:50:16.115
Why this little...

957
00:50:16.115 --> 00:50:17.115
Cheetah.

958
00:50:17.115 --> 00:50:18.655
Do you want to go to prison again?

959
00:50:21.284 --> 00:50:22.954
- He's not your friend? - No.

960
00:50:25.994 --> 00:50:27.195
What now?

961
00:50:27.195 --> 00:50:28.664
Are you his lackey or something?

962
00:50:28.664 --> 00:50:30.494
I'm not sure what that means,

963
00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:31.934
but I'm his friend.

964
00:50:37.164 --> 00:50:38.305
What was that, Mr. Kim?

965
00:50:38.305 --> 00:50:39.305
Don't be a crybaby,

966
00:50:39.305 --> 00:50:41.075
and let's leave before he stands back up.

967
00:50:41.644 --> 00:50:42.644
Let's go.

968
00:50:42.644 --> 00:50:43.974
It hurts so much.

969
00:51:05.365 --> 00:51:07.064
Take Hyun Ki down only.

970
00:51:09.365 --> 00:51:10.735
Don't touch Taeyang.

971
00:51:11.034 --> 00:51:13.604
Taeyang didn't even crash the plane.

972
00:51:13.834 --> 00:51:15.474
So there's no reason I would bring it down.

973
00:51:16.905 --> 00:51:18.974
Don't worry, Hong Joo.

974
00:51:30.155 --> 00:51:32.755
"Owning Taeyang Insurance is enough"?

975
00:51:32.755 --> 00:51:34.795
Owning Taeyang Insurance is enough.

976
00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:36.795
Please don't be greedy.

977
00:51:36.795 --> 00:51:38.664
"Please don't be greedy"?

978
00:51:47.204 --> 00:51:48.345
Secretary Kang.

979
00:51:48.604 --> 00:51:50.175
Did anyone come in my office...

980
00:51:50.175 --> 00:51:51.514
after I left?

981
00:51:53.144 --> 00:51:54.345
Hong Joo did?

982
00:51:54.814 --> 00:51:56.545
Go back to the office right now.

983
00:52:39.894 --> 00:52:42.164
Yes, Ha Ri. Good job.

984
00:52:42.994 --> 00:52:44.994
Yes, you guys have dinner first.

985
00:52:44.994 --> 00:52:46.264
(Copying)

986
00:52:46.764 --> 00:52:48.005
And Ha Ri.

987
00:52:48.604 --> 00:52:49.764
Okay.

988
00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:52.434
Pentium.

989
00:52:52.434 --> 00:52:53.834
I'll tell you Joo Hyun Ki's phone number,

990
00:52:53.834 --> 00:52:55.675
so track down his location now.

991
00:52:55.675 --> 00:52:56.905
Okay.

992
00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:59.115
Why are you asking for his location?

993
00:52:59.244 --> 00:53:01.045
Mr. Kang must need it.

994
00:53:01.744 --> 00:53:04.615
Okay. Let's go have meat to celebrate...

995
00:53:04.615 --> 00:53:05.715
Pentium's discharge.

996
00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:07.885
- Let's have pork. - Come on.

997
00:53:08.724 --> 00:53:09.985
We have a landlord here to treat us.

998
00:53:09.985 --> 00:53:12.595
Forget it, and just have pork.

999
00:53:16.095 --> 00:53:17.894
Why did he ask for Joo Hyun Ki's location?

1000
00:53:23.704 --> 00:53:26.505
(Dad)

1001
00:53:36.244 --> 00:53:38.215
Yes, Dad.

1002
00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:39.985
What have you done?

1003
00:53:40.115 --> 00:53:42.255
How dare you steal my stuff?

1004
00:53:42.525 --> 00:53:44.525
How dare you ruin my plan?

1005
00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:47.124
Dad, you can stop now.

1006
00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:49.365
Taeyang will be safe.

1007
00:53:49.695 --> 00:53:50.724
Kang Woo...

1008
00:53:50.724 --> 00:53:52.034
Kang Woo?

1009
00:53:53.235 --> 00:53:56.305
Did you get lured by that punk?

1010
00:53:56.834 --> 00:53:58.735
- Why this stupid... - Dad.

1011
00:54:00.075 --> 00:54:01.744
However he persuaded you,

1012
00:54:01.744 --> 00:54:03.405
it's all a lie.

1013
00:54:03.845 --> 00:54:05.115
Do you know what it means...

1014
00:54:05.115 --> 00:54:06.374
that he fooled you too?

1015
00:54:06.744 --> 00:54:10.345
It means he fears nothing!

1016
00:54:10.954 --> 00:54:12.885
Check it yourself!

1017
00:54:28.834 --> 00:54:29.865
Yes, Hong Joo.

1018
00:54:31.805 --> 00:54:34.945
Kang Woo, my dad found out.

1019
00:54:36.104 --> 00:54:37.374
Where are you?

1020
00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:38.374
Me?

1021
00:54:38.715 --> 00:54:40.615
I'm on my way to see Vice President Joo.

1022
00:54:41.414 --> 00:54:42.644
Why?

1023
00:54:45.414 --> 00:54:46.485
What...

1024
00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:50.124
are you trying to do?

1025
00:54:50.124 --> 00:54:52.325
What do you think I am trying to do?

1026
00:54:54.025 --> 00:54:55.264
Wait and see, Hong Joo.

1027
00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:25.854
Young Ho.

1028
00:55:26.795 --> 00:55:29.264
You have a job to do.

1029
00:55:30.465 --> 00:55:32.164
Why aren't they coming down?

1030
00:55:32.764 --> 00:55:34.564
I know.

1031
00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:37.204
Eat before they get burnt.

1032
00:55:42.675 --> 00:55:43.805
Does it hurt a lot?

1033
00:55:44.005 --> 00:55:45.175
A little.

1034
00:56:00.994 --> 00:56:02.425
Does it feel better?

1035
00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:06.635
What?

1036
00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:08.704
How pretty.

1037
00:56:12.305 --> 00:56:13.474
I mean, your necklace.

1038
00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.675
I crave coffee.

1039
00:56:22.514 --> 00:56:23.545
Do you want it too?

1040
00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:24.885
Sure.

1041
00:56:24.885 --> 00:56:26.184
I'll go get it then.

1042
00:56:35.295 --> 00:56:36.994
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1043
00:56:37.224 --> 00:56:38.434
When are we going down?

1044
00:56:41.005 --> 00:56:43.465
Let's go down when Mr. Choi gets here.

1045
00:56:43.805 --> 00:56:47.505
Let those two young people enjoy their time alone.

1046
00:57:05.425 --> 00:57:07.295
What are you doing here?

1047
00:57:07.425 --> 00:57:09.925
Mr. Choi Kang Woo.

1048
00:57:10.564 --> 00:57:11.934
You've been sitting there...

1049
00:57:11.934 --> 00:57:14.465
and watching me drink for 30 minutes.

1050
00:57:15.564 --> 00:57:17.104
What a waste of time.

1051
00:57:24.175 --> 00:57:26.175
You feel bad wasting just 30 minutes?

1052
00:57:27.545 --> 00:57:29.314
67 casualties.

1053
00:57:30.885 --> 00:57:32.784
123 injured people.

1054
00:57:33.584 --> 00:57:35.255
Their families.

1055
00:57:40.325 --> 00:57:41.925
And there's a person...

1056
00:57:43.025 --> 00:57:44.434
who wasted the past two years...

1057
00:57:45.534 --> 00:57:46.994
without knowing anything.

1058
00:57:46.994 --> 00:57:49.005
I don't understand what you're talking about.

1059
00:57:58.814 --> 00:58:00.474
Mayday, mayday.

1060
00:58:00.474 --> 00:58:03.084
Jeju Tower, respond.

1061
00:58:03.084 --> 00:58:05.684
Mayday, mayday.

1062
00:58:05.684 --> 00:58:06.755
Gosh.

1063
00:58:06.755 --> 00:58:09.325
Jeju Tower, respond.

1064
00:58:09.325 --> 00:58:12.095
No!

1065
00:58:12.095 --> 00:58:13.124
Where...

1066
00:58:13.925 --> 00:58:15.325
did you get it?

1067
00:58:17.264 --> 00:58:18.295
Kang Woo.

1068
00:58:19.064 --> 00:58:20.064
Hong Joo.

1069
00:58:21.135 --> 00:58:22.865
Did you give it to him?

1070
00:58:27.135 --> 00:58:28.474
I'll call you again.

1071
00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.584
If you touch my people again,

1072
00:58:40.215 --> 00:58:41.624
I will kill you.

1073
00:58:59.834 --> 00:59:01.005
Kang Woo...

1074
00:59:22.894 --> 00:59:24.124
Kang Woo.

1075
00:59:25.494 --> 00:59:27.235
I thought I warned you.

1076
00:59:29.334 --> 00:59:32.474
You are not supposed to hurt my family.

1077
00:59:47.925 --> 00:59:49.155
Oh, gosh!

1078
00:59:49.284 --> 00:59:50.925
You surprised me, Pentium.

1079
00:59:51.624 --> 00:59:53.494
Mr. Kim, you get scared really easily.

1080
00:59:54.664 --> 00:59:55.664
Wait.

1081
00:59:56.124 --> 00:59:57.595
Why are you talking casually to me?

1082
00:59:58.064 --> 01:00:00.195
Aren't you the same age as Ms. Jang? You're 27.

1083
01:00:00.195 --> 01:00:01.434
You're two years younger than me.

1084
01:00:01.434 --> 01:00:03.534
Then you can speak casually to me too.

1085
01:00:03.534 --> 01:00:04.735
No, thanks.

1086
01:00:04.735 --> 01:00:07.135
I heard you only speak casually with friends.

1087
01:00:07.135 --> 01:00:09.445
That's why I'm asking you to speak casually.

1088
01:00:09.445 --> 01:00:11.014
You never know.

1089
01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:13.474
I might end up calling you Min Joon.

1090
01:00:16.744 --> 01:00:17.954
I'll think about it.

1091
01:00:18.255 --> 01:00:19.914
The meat might get burnt. Come along.

1092
01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:24.255
Gosh,

1093
01:00:24.255 --> 01:00:25.624
why is he playing hard to get?

1094
01:00:48.345 --> 01:00:49.345
Mr. Kim.

1095
01:00:50.584 --> 01:00:51.615
Min Joon!

1096
01:01:01.865 --> 01:01:02.965
What's with him?

1097
01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:05.295
Do you know him?

1098
01:01:12.474 --> 01:01:13.575
Pentium.

1099
01:01:15.345 --> 01:01:17.345
Pentium, Pentium.

1100
01:01:20.075 --> 01:01:21.584
Why isn't he coming?

1101
01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:30.025
Did you go to pick some coffee beans?

1102
01:01:30.025 --> 01:01:31.394
What's taking you so long?

1103
01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:35.795
Ms. Jang...

1104
01:01:36.365 --> 01:01:37.425
Mr. Kim.

1105
01:01:38.965 --> 01:01:39.965
What's wrong?

1106
01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:42.135
Help us.

1107
01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:56.545
Help!

1108
01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:00.615
Help!

1109
01:02:24.345 --> 01:02:27.345
(Mad Dog)

1110
01:02:27.615 --> 01:02:29.084
Make sure you remember.

1111
01:02:29.115 --> 01:02:31.414
We need to catch the guy who did this to Noo Ri.

1112
01:02:31.555 --> 01:02:33.155
Do you want JH?

1113
01:02:33.155 --> 01:02:34.755
What will you do now?

1114
01:02:35.555 --> 01:02:36.985
That means...

1115
01:02:37.255 --> 01:02:39.055
he'll need the black box.

1116
01:02:39.295 --> 01:02:41.865
He's holding a secret meeting...

1117
01:02:41.865 --> 01:02:43.764
in his unconscious son's hospital room.

1118
01:02:44.025 --> 01:02:45.695
Should I give a good barking...

1119
01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:48.135
in front of the entire nation?

1120
01:02:48.635 --> 01:02:51.204
I'm telling you to stop threatening me.

1121
01:02:51.204 --> 01:02:54.575
Mr. Choi did something very troublesome.

1122
01:02:55.144 --> 01:02:56.644
Should it be just us two from here?

1123
01:02:57.175 --> 01:02:58.345
Mr. Kim, turn around.

1124
01:02:58.445 --> 01:03:00.744
Where are you? Where are you right now?
