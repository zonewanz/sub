<i>Corrections by Uncle Andy</i>

3
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.080
Ogo, ogo.

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.380
I'll take you home with me.

5
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.740
Ogo, ogo.

6
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.300
Episode 9

7
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.760
I thought you all couldn't make it.

8
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.560
Ehy.

9
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.440
That was true.

10
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.900
However, you said that you
were alone in the sauna,

11
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.700
that you were lonely,
you were bored, you were dying,

12
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.900
you were alone in the whole world, etc.

13
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.040
In the wee hours of the morning,
you sent 20 messages.

14
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.000
So, how could I not come?

15
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.920
I thought it was my
alarm clock going off.

16
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.700
I was sleeping, but thought something
had happened, so I was so shocked.

17
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.700
Avengers Club!

18
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.440
Fighting!

19
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700
However, is unnie okay?

20
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.300
Of course.

21
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.360
I just want to try it
furiously for once.

22
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.380
However, you.
Why are your eyes so swollen?

23
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.560
Did something happen again?

24
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:46.460
Oh.

25
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.020
I had a little run in
with my husband yesterday.

26
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.460
Did he hit you again?

27
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.320
No!

28
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.380
I cried.

29
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.460
Why?

30
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.860
It's just that...

31
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.960
husband and I had to do an
interview together yesterday

32
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.080
and it was at the orphanage
that I grew up in.

33
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.860
I'm okay now.

34
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.920
I'm not alone.

35
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.820
Of course!

36
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.200
This is why we made this
Avengers Club after all.

37
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.340
That's right. That's right.

38
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.100
If we live, we all live together.
We'll also take revenge together.

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.300
We can't leave any of us alone.
We'll be hurt.

40
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.120
That's right.

41
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.740
Three is better than two,
and four is better than three.

42
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.560
From now on, let's toss out the whole
"suitable for the Avengers Club" thing.

43
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.280
Let's punish the bad guys properly.

44
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.540
I agree!

45
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.400
Me, too. Me, too.

46
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.240
I also like it.

47
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.660
So, what I was thinking...

48
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.600
Aigoo. It's good. It's good. Even
the ideas are overflowing. It's good.

49
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.720
So,

50
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.500
what are the plans that
you two are proposing?

51
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.320
Huh?

52
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.840
Oh.

53
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.440
Mom, didn't you go to the store?

54
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.400
Ay.

55
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.840
I just met up with the ajummas
to warm up our bodies a bit.

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.440
I'm going now, I'll be back later.

57
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.560
There is nothing for you
to be downcast about.

58
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.360
Still, mom,

59
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.780
this is the first time my
record is being questioned.

60
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.920
So, I am a little anxious.

61
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.600
Anxious? Why should you be anxious?

62
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.800
That you did nothing wrong,

63
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.640
I know it,

64
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.040
you know,

65
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.100
and even our Hee Soo knows.

66
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.660
That's the thing, mom.

67
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.000
Yah!

68
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.180
We three are the only
ones who know the truth.

69
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.500
That's what I'm saying.

70
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.900
The heavens know,

71
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.980
and everyone in the world will know.

72
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.500
It will become like that.

73
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.780
Now, go.

74
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.460
We're going now, and will be back later.

75
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.500
We're going now, and will be back later.

76
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.080
Yes.

77
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.720
You've had something to eat, right?

78
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.200
Yes.

79
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.140
We'll be back.

80
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.720
Okay.

81
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.100
I was helped very much by you,
Principal.

82
00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.640
Oh.

83
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.060
You shouldn't do this.

84
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.420
I have no other way to convey
my gratefulness to you.

85
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.000
Please accept this,
Principal Hong Sang Man.

86
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.740
Yes, well.

87
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.220
If it's really what you want,
Jung Wook's mother.

88
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.240
The video that I gave you so
that you could use in court,

89
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.580
I had no idea that it
would be spread like this.

90
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.160
Definitely,

91
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.900
your scale is very
different from others.

92
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.840
Me?

93
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.100
Oh, well... Could it be anything
compared to yours, Principal?

94
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.940
Really.

95
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.960
Ah.

96
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.120
Come in.

97
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.660
Oh, Teacher Kim.

98
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.600
Here is Jung Wook's mother.

99
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.900
Your age?

100
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.500
24

101
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.400
Your school?

102
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.880
I've graduated.

103
00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.080
From where?

104
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.860
Ilgu University.

105
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.600
What?

106
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.900
What little corner is that located in?
I've never heard of it.

107
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.900
Gyeonggi Province, Han Young City,
II Jung San Route 13-3,

108
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.940
Ilgu University, College of
Education is where I graduated from.

109
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.580
Oh!

110
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.540
Oh.

111
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.880
Principal,

112
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.920
since when did our Sevit High
School not discern backgrounds,

113
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.080
and just bring anyone in to be teachers?

114
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.400
Limited contract.
She's a limited contract worker.

115
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.860
Ah!

116
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.800
Limited...contract.

117
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.460
If you don't have the confidence to
take the teaching certification exam,

118
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.400
you should meet a man
and get married instead.

119
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.820
If you can't even do that,

120
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.360
then you should take after your mother
and diligently sell fish at least.

121
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.240
Jung Wook's mother.

122
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.900
What?!

123
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.980
How dare you so ill-manneredly
raise your eyes.

124
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.820
Why?

125
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.180
Are you going to hit me as well?

126
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.480
No matter how uneducated you are,

127
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.780
if you hit a student and
put him in the hospital,

128
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.700
then at least once... at least once,

129
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.640
shouldn't you go to the hospital room
door in order to consider yourself,

130
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.040
no matter how barely,
barely a human being?

131
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.080
I have never hit a student!

132
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.960
Yah!

133
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.380
That's enough. That's enough.

134
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.940
And, Principal, when did you say
was the disciplinary hearing?

135
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.200
This week, I'll try to get it
organized for as soon as possible.

136
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.520
Okay

137
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.000
Son?

138
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.220
You're quietly lying down, right?

139
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.240
Okay.

140
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.660
Oh

141
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.980
Teach!

142
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.140
Are you okay?

143
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.000
"That the truth will be revealed,

144
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.700
so that the heavens will know, and
everyone in the world will know, soon"

145
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.780
is what my mother has said.

146
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.580
Yes.

147
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.440
That's definitely going to happen.

148
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.460
Yah, Hwang Jung Wook
asked us to go visit him.

149
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.580
He has to be ill in order
for us to go visit him.

150
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.160
Or you can go by yourself.

151
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.560
Do you think that I'm going to do that?

152
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.460
Yes.

153
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.100
That time here, you were about
to save Hee Soo, weren't you?

154
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.000
If I hadn't been here, then you would
probably have become his savior.

155
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.040
The chance you lost then,

156
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.140
let's just say that you're
making up for that by doing this.

157
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.140
And, if I do?

158
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.200
I won't bother you ever again?

159
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.720
Okay.

160
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.560
Oh

161
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.680
Baek Seo!

162
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.240
Are you hurting a lot?

163
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:55.980
Oh?

164
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.760
No!

165
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.540
Not at all.

166
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.840
I'm totally fine.

167
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.580
They say that Teacher Kim Hee
Kyung kicked you and you got hurt.

168
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.480
But, you're okay?

169
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.060
Oh?

170
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.820
Ahh

171
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.420
Yah!

172
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.520
I shouldn't talk about that.

173
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.840
Then I'll go now.

174
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.200
Oh! Wait, wait, wait, wait...

175
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.720
Oh, okay, what is there that
we can't talk about between us.

176
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.020
You know my mother. We lied about it.

177
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.240
This is my uncle's hospital.

178
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.160
Just until that contract teacher
is fired, she told me to lie here.

179
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
But, how did you get the video?

180
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.360
That was the school's CCTV.

181
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.100
Ay, that...

182
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.840
You know my mother.

183
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.560
She said she gave some of
"this" to the principal.

184
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.320
Oh.

185
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:38.880
Oh.

186
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.160
Baek Seo,
do you want something to drink?

187
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.280
I have just about everything here.

188
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.900
Thank you.

189
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.860
Don't let my face show.

190
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.140
It's just the back of your head showing.

191
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.440
It looks like a guy's. A guy.

192
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.120
Yah

193
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.300
You're better at acting
than I would have thought.

194
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.860
You said you wouldn't
bother me any more!

195
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.540
This is the same direction
that I have to go!

196
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.400
Here. Yes, there.

197
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.280
And, here.

198
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.900
And, here, too.

199
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.400
"Violent teacher".

200
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.560
And, try that one.

201
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.340
"The teacher is trash."

202
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.720
What in the world.

203
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.060
Report it.

204
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.140
Ay. And, what is this about
setting a proper example...

205
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.720
Avengers Club's good luck charm is here!

206
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.240
Oh, Soo Gyum, you're here.

207
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.100
Report this one, too?

208
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.060
Of course.

209
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.300
And, you're doing okay as well?
Yes.

210
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.100
Report it.
Reporting.

211
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.780
Ehy!

212
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.220
You don't need to do things like this.

213
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.060
Hong Do unnie said that we should report
the comments cursing Hee Kyung out.

214
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.280
Until we can do something else,
unnie said we should at least do this.

215
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.940
It's just that...

216
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.840
when I see them, my fever spikes.

217
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.220
People who don't know anything

218
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.220
write such... harsh comments.

219
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.280
That is why...

220
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.880
I came.

221
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.680
What is there that we can't
talk about between us.

222
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.000
Mission accomplished.

223
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.740
You know my mother.

224
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.660
We lied about it.

225
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.680
This is my uncle's hospital.

226
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.480
Just until that contract teacher
is fired, she told me to lie here.

227
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.200
But, how did you get the video?
That is a school CCTV.

228
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.460
Ah, you know my mother.

229
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.220
She said she gave some of
"this" to the principal.

230
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.360
Oh. Oh!

231
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.820
Do you want to drink something?

232
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.480
I have almost everything here. Pick one.

233
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.520
Oh! Ohhhhh, our good luck charm! Ohhhh!

234
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.600
My Seo Yeon!

235
00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.780
It's really my Seo Yeon!

236
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.700
Ajummas, it's not the time
to be like this right now.

237
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.780
This is now the real start.

238
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.200
That's right.

239
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.500
This is good.

240
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.320
Let's just bind the
two of them as a set,

241
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.000
and send them flying with one punch.

242
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.960
One Strike, Two Blood.

243
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.840
Yes, that's really it.

244
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.280
Quickly. Let's go on to the next plan.

245
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.340
Avengers Club, fighting!

246
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.640
I'm so happy.

247
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.900
Did you really want to come here again?

248
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.240
You shouldn't have any
good memories of it.

249
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.580
They say that Teacher Kim Hee
Kyung kicked you and you were hurt.

250
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.060
But, are you okay?

251
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.160
Oh.

252
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.700
Ah...

253
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.040
I shouldn't talk about this.

254
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.340
Okay, then. I'm going.

255
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.500
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait...

256
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.840
You know my mother.

257
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600
We lied about it.

258
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.780
This is my uncle's hospital.

259
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.620
Just until that contract teacher
is fired, she told me to lie here.

260
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.940
But, how did you get the video?

261
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.320
She said that she gave some of
"this" to the principal.

262
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.060
Oh! Baek Seo,
do you want something to drink?

263
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.080
I have just about everything here.

264
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.020
Since Jung Wook's mother lied about it,

265
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.680
then you're guilty of
deception and making threats.

266
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.340
And of using a self-injury
to make a threat.

267
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.760
And, you also gave "this"
to Principal Hong Sang Man,

268
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.800
so that includes the crime of bribery.

269
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.620
Since you spread the fabrication around,
that's libel.

270
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.740
Wait...

271
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.700
Isn't there a charge to bring against the
hospital that accepted a fake patient?

272
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.100
What are you doing?
Not writing anything down?

273
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.680
Are you going to be able
to remember all that?

274
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.640
You have to defend yourself in court.

275
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.120
Hee Soo's mother.

276
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.620
How much will it cost in
order to get your forgiveness?

277
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.320
Money.

278
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.040
My little sister Jung Hye
has more money than you.

279
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.420
That courtroom that you like so much,

280
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.480
let's go there together.

281
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:22.640
W...w...

282
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:25.980
Hee Soo's mother.

283
00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.480
What is this?

284
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.940
This attitude?

285
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.320
Hee Soo's mother.

286
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.420
Hee Soo's mother.

287
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.760
Hee Soo's mother.

288
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.700
Hee Soo's mother.

289
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.260
What are you doing?

290
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.940
If my husband finds out, I'm dead.

291
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.520
Ah...

292
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.460
Vice President Hwang.

293
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.200
I heard about him from Jung Hye,
so I know him well.

294
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.440
That he is a model of integrity without any
blemishes and that he's so straightforward,

295
00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.780
that he's like a bamboo tree.

296
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.620
Please save me.

297
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.200
Since you're being like this,
it's very uncomfortable for me.

298
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.760
You should just be your usual style
and do whatever you want.

299
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.240
Settlement.

300
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.060
Court.

301
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.180
Settlement.

302
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:16.940
Court!

303
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.420
Settlement!

304
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.820
Court.

305
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.780
One more time.

306
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.700
One more time, I will kneel and beg.

307
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:31.820
Settlement!

308
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.500
If you will just agree to a settlement,

309
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.560
I'll do whatever you want.

310
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080
Anything?

311
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.180
Ok.

312
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.140
I accept "anything".

313
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.380
Get up.

314
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:53.940
Huh?

315
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.660
Seo Yeon.

316
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.100
Hee Soo's mother said to tell
you that she's very grateful

317
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.700
and that she'll buy you
something delicious.

318
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.660
You did well, Seo Yeon.

319
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.120
Lee Soo Gyum said that if
I did him the favor that

320
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.880
he would stop bothering me.
That's why I did it.

321
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:11.880
Seo Yeon.

322
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.780
Isn't there anything you want to eat?

323
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.720
Ddeokbbokki.

324
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.260
Oh, okay.

325
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.980
Mom will quickly make some for you.

326
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.760
Hee Kyung.

327
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.800
Hee Soo.

328
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.060
Yah

329
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.900
Where did your sister go? Why isn't
she answering her phone at all?

330
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.560
She's not home yet, mom.

331
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.260
Ok.

332
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.920
Sit down. Sit down.

333
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.240
Mom will show you
something unbelievable.

334
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.200
Mom.

335
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.892
Don't try so hard.
If you're having a hard time,

336
00:15:41.092 --> 00:15:42.480
you can just say that
you're having a hard time.

337
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.740
That's not it.

338
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.540
Mom...

339
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.880
<i>Hong Do-ya.</i>

340
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.620
<i>Don't cry.</i>

341
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.300
<i>Hee Kyung is here.</i>

342
00:15:59.420 --> 00:15:59.780
Oh!

343
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.880
Aigoo. Aigoo.

344
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.255
Drinking to try to make yourself
feel better when you're upset.

345
00:16:05.455 --> 00:16:06.800
I told you to correct that habit,
didn't I?

346
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.580
Ay, who does she take after that she...?

347
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.280
Mom, come here.
Aigoo. Aigoo.

348
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.320
Sit down.

349
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.100
Yah, yah, yah, sit.

350
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:19.880
Here.

351
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840
Aigoo.

352
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.640
Here.

353
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.600
What this is...

354
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.900
since I don't know when
I'll get another paycheck,

355
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.700
so, this is a gift to
commemorate my starting work

356
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.140
and also my stopping work.

357
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.280
Mom, try one.

358
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.060
This is not the time for you
to be buying these things.

359
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.200
Why?

360
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.680
Is someone like me unable
to even give a present?

361
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.300
Oh!

362
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.640
Oh, this is good.

363
00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.980
Because of those articles,
I was so tired,

364
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.040
but now I feel my strength
completely returning.

365
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.620
There is no one but my daughter.

366
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.940
Oh, mom.

367
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.580
You said you would show
me something unbelievable.

368
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.300
Ah ah

369
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.860
Come here. Come here. Come here.

370
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.440
You two. You said that you
believed in your mom, didn't you?

371
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:15.760
Here.

372
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.920
They say that Teacher Kim Hee
Kyung kicked you and you were hurt.

373
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.580
But, are you okay?

374
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.940
I will do that interview you proposed.

375
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.080
Yes, I will see you there.

376
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.820
The more I see grandfather, the more I
don't know what kind of person he is.

377
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.060
He is a person who started at your age, and
he has made Hae Rang into what it is today.

378
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.580
So, he may not like anyone
he sees as his successor.

379
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.720
He may be looking at
you as his final hope.

380
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.480
I better quickly
straighten that out then.

381
00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.540
Actually, I also...

382
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.040
She was an amusing woman.

383
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.480
She brought that with her.

384
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.980
Because of you,
do I have to deal with a woman like her?

385
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.700
"I also..." what?

386
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.500
In case President Kim Jung Yun
should contact you, don't meet her.

387
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:25.600
Why?

388
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.220
Just because.

389
00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.020
Don't be used by her.

390
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:30.660
Yes.

391
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.760
I think I will have to
be like that from now on.

392
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.580
Who is it when it's so early in
the morning? You're very popular.

393
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.760
It's because today is my birthday.

394
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.620
Why didn't you tell me?

395
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.120
Ay, who celebrates a birthday
for a 19 year old anyway?

396
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:51.840
Oh!

397
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.320
Just stop and drop me off right there.

398
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:53.980
Yes.

399
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.260
I'll be off to school now.

400
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.860
Birthday?

401
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.660
Omo, who is this?

402
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.080
He said you lived like
an invisible person,

403
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.120
and now you're trying to treat
me as if I'm invisible, too.

404
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.740
Oh!

405
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.820
Give me that one.

406
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.700
Yes, I will, Madam.

407
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.800
Oh, then...

408
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.840
Give me that one, too.

409
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.340
Yes, Madam, I understand.

410
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.020
Then, this one is really...

411
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.800
That one as well.

412
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.220
No.

413
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.920
From here to there, send it to my house.

414
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.960
Thank you, Madam. I understand.

415
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.600
Well, then.

416
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.860
This one... this is mine.
Just let me buy this one.

417
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.420
I... I...
Excuse me.

418
00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.280
Do you know what day today is?

419
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.620
Why should I have to
know what day it is?

420
00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.000
Why?

421
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.040
Do you have something to say to me?

422
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.580
There is something that
I've been curious about.

423
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.060
Where do you buy things like that?

424
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:09.960
Why? Do you want one?

425
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.400
Don't just sell to anyone,
making their value fall.

426
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.140
I'll be careful.

427
00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.800
Please go safely.

428
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.040
Yah!

429
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.020
You...

430
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.120
You...

431
00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.700
How can...

432
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.400
Please go safely.

433
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.020
That's fine.

434
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.880
We'll meet there.

435
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.760
Tonight, we carry out the plan.

436
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.830
Thank you for having the courage to do this,
though it must have been difficult for you.

437
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.550
May I ask you about your son first?

438
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.940
The article will be released soon.

439
00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.380
Yes.

440
00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:07.316
You could have buried it
till the election was over.

441
00:23:07.516 --> 00:23:10.910
Thank you for revealing a difficult story.

442
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.200
Both my husband and I were
so lost in our sorrow,

443
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:23.020
that we couldn't send
our son off properly.

444
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:29.710
We should have at least put the
departed child's mind at peace.

445
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.280
This interview today,
did Candidate Baek also agree?

446
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:44.160
I think he will understand.

447
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.000
Everyone, what should you
do when the red light is on?

448
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.240
We wait.
Yes, wait.

449
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.490
Ah, the green light has come on.
Raise your hands...

450
00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.930
and slowly go across.
Go across. Go across.

451
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.520
Yes, right.

452
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.680
Candidate Baek Young Pyo.
Yes?

453
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.280
Could you please take a photo with my son?
Ah okay.

454
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.530
Aigoo. You're handsome.

455
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.160
I'm shooting now.
Are you studying hard?

456
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:18.862
Yes.

457
00:24:19.062 --> 00:24:21.720
SungHyun, you have to smile.
One, two three.

458
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.960
I can't do this again.

459
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.770
But the mothers' response was very good.

460
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:29.770
Did you send the press release?
Yes.

461
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.150
Answer it.

462
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:33.150
Hello.

463
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.480
What?

464
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:36.480
Madam did?

465
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.480
I see.

466
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.990
You should see this.

[Exclusive: Seoul Superintendent

Baek Young Pyo's son
committed suicide 2 years ago.

Wife Lee Mi Sook's heartwrenching
confession reveals their son's death]

Baek Seo!

471
00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.790
Why? What?

472
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.800
Your brother, is it true?

473
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.990
You said your brother was studying
overseas, but he had committed suicide?

474
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.181
You've come early.

475
00:25:25.381 --> 00:25:27.630
Today, I received
phone calls all day long.

476
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.140
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

477
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.490
I'm sorry I didn't discuss it with you.
No, you did well.

478
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.520
It was something that we had to
go through at least once anyway.

479
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.640
Ah hello. Reporter Park.

480
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.160
Sure.
The panel discussion will go as planned.

481
00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.160
Yes.

482
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.390
Seo Yeon, you came?

483
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.150
Seo Yeon, by any chance,
did you see the news?

484
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.210
You did well.

485
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.620
Uh?
I said you did well.

486
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.060
I'm going to study, so please leave.

487
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.540
Oh, yes. Eat the fruit while you study.

488
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.500
Okay

489
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.580
Wow,
did you really rent this whole place?

490
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.620
It's not the first time.

491
00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.350
Isn't it the right size
to make him confess?

492
00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.656
Shall I rent it every
time we have a meeting?

but I think it's quite fantastic.
Use a bad guy to catch a bad guy.

496
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.954
That's because
Hong Sang Man knows that

497
00:27:16.154 --> 00:27:17.690
we're the Avengers Club,
so we couldn't face...

498
00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.300
him directly...was what I was
about to say thoughtlessly.

499
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.540
But, Madam rented a site
like this out and everything.

500
00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.460
Oh, that's right. Right.

501
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:40.320
But, our Madam has prepared this perfect
event, so why aren't they coming yet?

502
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.640
Joo Gil Yeon,

503
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.870
can we trust her?

504
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:48.530
Sure. I definitely told her,
so let's at least wait for now.

505
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.900
They've arrived! Turn off the lights!
Turn them off! Turn them off!

506
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.600
Were you okay getting here?
Yes, yes.

507
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.860
Oh.

508
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.872
You said that you rented out the space,

509
00:28:09.072 --> 00:28:11.800
so I thought it would be somewhere small,
but this is so splendid.

510
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.000
Could I host the principal
in just any old place?

511
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.000
I'm awestruck.

512
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.830
The ambience is so nice.

513
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.780
I put some effort into it. Please sit.
Yes. Please sit.

514
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.200
Uh. Can I?

515
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.160
Come on..

516
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.060
Let's have one more glass.

517
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.200
Here. Here, here.

518
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.160
One shot!

519
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.580
Confession! Confession!

520
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.520
By the way, Mr. Principal, what ill
feelings do you have for her that you...?

521
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.820
I mean, it was ill fate for me, but...

522
00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.140
Ah, what?
Oh that fishy smelling...

523
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:11.760
I mean Teacher Kim's mother.
Ah...

524
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.840
the fish seller?

525
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:16.840
Aigoo. She's the worst, the worst.

526
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:21.420
It'll put me off my drink,
so let's not talk about it.

527
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.617
Aigoo. Here.

528
00:29:24.817 --> 00:29:28.520
Oh, it's just that I
want to get back at her,

529
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.513
but I wondered if there
was a good method...

530
00:29:30.713 --> 00:29:31.070
Ah..

531
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.240
Oh, that. I already did it.

532
00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.840
Yes? How did you do it?
When, where, what, and how?

533
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:52.280
The Police Captain Kim,
he's my hometown junior,

534
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.054
using that person,
I made it so that

535
00:29:54.254 --> 00:29:56.860
she couldn't sell her fish for
2-3 days and made her suffer.

536
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.680
Omo. So,

537
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.780
because of personal feelings,
you used a public official.

538
00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.120
This is what you're saying.
Bingo.

539
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.220
Bingo.

540
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:09.820
Public official.
Power!

541
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.310
That's exactly right.

542
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.110
Here, here, here.

543
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.330
[Sexual Harassment Confession!]

544
00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.550
However, that girl,
why do you hate her so much?

545
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.480
Who?
That fish seller's daughter.

546
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:46.880
Like mother, like daughter.
You know Teacher Kim Hee Kyung.

547
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:52.250
From her first day of work,
when she spilled a pot of stew on me...

548
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.410
Oh, even thinking about it now,
makes me shudder. Shudder.

549
00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.980
However, why would Teacher Kim do that?

550
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:04.963
Oh. Well, because she
seemed like a daughter to me,

551
00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:08.970
I affectionately patted her a little bit.

552
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.390
She totally treated me
like a bug or something.

553
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.330
She has no manners. No manners.

554
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.024
How could she be so ill-mannered
towards the principal?

555
00:31:19.224 --> 00:31:21.040
You must have been very uncomfortable.

556
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.220
That's right. That's right.

557
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:28.200
Other women teachers were just quiet, how
dare just a contract worker like her..

558
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.010
make a fuss? Hm? And protest? Ehy!

559
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.860
That is why I always say a
family education is so important.

560
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:37.640
Right, how a fish seller's daughter
is... Ehy. Here, here, here, here.

561
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.590
Let's just talk about good things now.
Mr. Principal!

562
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.363
Yes. We have gotten
into the same boat now.

563
00:31:42.563 --> 00:31:43.660
Oh! The boat is good.

564
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:53.065
It was good today.

565
00:31:53.265 --> 00:31:54.660
Yes, yes the stairs.

566
00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.430
Second round?
Second right, good.

567
00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.120
Yes, yes. Wait.

568
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:06.040
Get in first. Aigoo Omomomo.

569
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.940
Mr. Driver,
please take care of him well.

570
00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.060
Good bye, Mr. Principal.

571
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.560
You should have asked for money instead.

572
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.200
Are you sure that you got it?
You'll know once you hear it.

573
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.120
Settlement.

574
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.410
I should check the product first.

575
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:42.970
You should go.

576
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.970
You look tired.

577
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.790
Settlement.

578
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.640
How did it go?

579
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.020
OK OK.

580
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.380
Success!

581
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.800
Success!

582
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:26.700
Ah.

583
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.665
Because we were doing
this revenge thing,

584
00:33:31.865 --> 00:33:33.710
we didn't even celebrate
Soo Gyum's birthday.

585
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.310
You thought we didn't know, didn't you?

586
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.390
No. To succeed in our
revenge is the real gift.

587
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.600
This. I thought it would suit you well,
Soo Gyum.

588
00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.920
Thank you.

589
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.280
Since I am a woman who
has nothing but money.

590
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.280
Oh, that's okay.
Aigoo, take it.

591
00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.570
What about you, Madam?

592
00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.190
Yes, you said you went to the
department store to buy a gift.

593
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.100
It's at home.
What is it?

594
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.000
It will be good as
long as it's not shoes.

595
00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:09.710
Why?

596
00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.630
They say that if you buy someone shoes,
that they will run away.

597
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.450
Then let's just leave it that
I'll get Madam's gift at home.

598
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.000
Thank you, everyone!

599
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.050
Should we at least light a candle?

600
00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.620
Yes.

601
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.520
What brings you to my room?

602
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.470
Uh? My gift?

603
00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.600
That's right, but..

604
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.330
Wearing these, may I run away?

605
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.330
Uhm.

606
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.300
They fit exactly right.

607
00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.070
Do you like it?
Totally.

608
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.340
Then study.
Yes. I'll study hard.

609
00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.540
Hello.

610
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.680
Woa..

611
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.870
Principal.

612
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.560
What...?
Are you uncomfortable somewhere?

613
00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:07.978
How could you just come in
and sit in here as you please?

614
00:36:08.178 --> 00:36:08.670
I have...

615
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.370
something that I should
let you hear personally.

616
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:13.560
Ah.

617
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.180
What is it?

618
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.280
First, please sit.
No. I'm ok.

619
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.280
Then keep standing.

620
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:32.510
The Police Captain Kim,
he's my hometown junior,

621
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:34.355
using that person,
I made it so that

622
00:36:34.555 --> 00:36:37.680
she couldn't sell her fish for
2, 3 days and made her suffer.

623
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.000
You know the rest of it, don't you?

624
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:46.170
Fish no... Madam?

625
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.760
Go ahead.

626
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.270
I mean, I suffered at your hands once.
What?

627
00:36:55.470 --> 00:37:00.060
You did at that time. The chair.
I have no idea what you're talking about.

628
00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.410
B.J. stands for Bok Ja (Avengers') Club,
right?

629
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.100
You glued me to the chair and fed
me medicine that caused diarrhea.

630
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.910
Do you have any evidence?

631
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.070
I have.

632
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.070
Let's talk only about facts.

633
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:24.220
Ah, so I mean let's just both forget
about the bad things in the past...

634
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.600
Ah, how about this?

635
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.050
What?

636
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.520
I'd like to recruit Kim Hee Kyung
as a regular teacher of our school.

637
00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.465
Let's bury each other's
wounds deep in our hearts,

638
00:37:41.665 --> 00:37:43.810
take a broad viewpoint
and be future-oriented...

639
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:44.760
Wait.

640
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.600
I will think about it.

641
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.150
Today, a disciplinary hearing
for Teacher Kim will be held.

642
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:59.040
Deciding before that... at least for
the sake of your daughter's future...

643
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.240
So, you just came out?

644
00:38:13.392 --> 00:38:15.064
It's just that, for mom,

645
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.952
your intentions are important.

646
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.320
Ah, mom...

647
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.248
Did you hire detectives or something?

648
00:38:24.496 --> 00:38:24.784
Huh?

649
00:38:25.808 --> 00:38:28.960
I mean, where did all this
evidence suddenly come from?

650
00:38:29.328 --> 00:38:29.728
Oh...

651
00:38:31.448 --> 00:38:33.512
That isn't what's important.

652
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.712
I said the important
thing is what you want.

653
00:38:37.872 --> 00:38:38.352
How about you?

654
00:38:40.216 --> 00:38:41.688
Do you want me to
formally become a teacher?

655
00:38:45.352 --> 00:38:47.720
That time,
at the parents' event last time,

656
00:38:48.088 --> 00:38:50.208
I wanted to confront the Principal,
but you were...

657
00:38:53.856 --> 00:38:54.736
Like this.

658
00:38:57.728 --> 00:38:59.376
You say that you want
to do it so much...

659
00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:05.176
Oh, it's time.

660
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.016
Hee Kyung

661
00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:11.224
Just think of yourself.

662
00:39:12.984 --> 00:39:14.248
For mom, that will be enough.

663
00:39:17.064 --> 00:39:18.064
I'll go in now, mom.

664
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.936
Although Teacher Kim didn't
directly use violence on a student,

665
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.248
but because it's undeniable that your
acts were capable of harming a student,

666
00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.760
this disciplinary committee has decided
to hold you responsible for this matter.

667
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.384
There is no need to do this
when we are all one family.

668
00:39:48.512 --> 00:39:49.568
Teacher Kim

669
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:52.112
should self-reflect properly
so that an incident like this

670
00:39:52.552 --> 00:39:53.840
doesn't happen again.

671
00:39:54.216 --> 00:39:55.976
And also a suspension
of salary for a month...

672
00:39:56.632 --> 00:39:57.080
I...

673
00:39:58.184 --> 00:39:59.224
Will resign.

674
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.080
Teacher Kim,

675
00:40:02.416 --> 00:40:03.888
I've talked to your mother...

676
00:40:04.088 --> 00:40:04.640
Principal,

677
00:40:05.504 --> 00:40:06.064
I am...

678
00:40:07.656 --> 00:40:09.056
planning on revealing the truth,

679
00:40:09.536 --> 00:40:11.248
so I will refuse to take
any severance money.

680
00:40:11.656 --> 00:40:12.336
Teacher Kim

681
00:40:12.744 --> 00:40:14.584
You need to work at least one
year to get severance money.

682
00:40:14.896 --> 00:40:16.152
Goodbye.

683
00:40:18.296 --> 00:40:19.584
Ah, Teacher Kim...

684
00:40:20.096 --> 00:40:20.912
Teacher Kim!

685
00:40:36.144 --> 00:40:37.088
Mom...

686
00:40:39.264 --> 00:40:39.960
You did well.

687
00:40:40.912 --> 00:40:41.992
You did well, my daughter.

688
00:40:42.344 --> 00:40:43.240
Very cool, noona!

689
00:40:44.264 --> 00:40:45.104
Aigoo, aigoo.

690
00:40:45.824 --> 00:40:47.136
You suffered so much.

691
00:40:50.544 --> 00:40:51.344
What are you doing?

692
00:40:51.592 --> 00:40:52.640
You have to do what
you were going to do.

693
00:41:00.112 --> 00:41:01.216
Sorry.

694
00:41:02.504 --> 00:41:03.696
Could you hear that, Ms. Joo Gil Yeon?

695
00:41:06.208 --> 00:41:07.288
Repeat it. Louder.

696
00:41:09.536 --> 00:41:09.944
Contract worker...

697
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.528
Teacher, I'm sorry!

698
00:41:29.064 --> 00:41:31.200
I am sorry, too.

699
00:41:32.976 --> 00:41:33.568
Don't worry.

700
00:41:34.184 --> 00:41:35.608
I'm not going to record any video.

701
00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.368
Just stay still.

702
00:41:38.656 --> 00:41:39.872
We'll go back in first.

703
00:41:39.912 --> 00:41:41.360
Since lunch time is over.

704
00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:41.792
Okay.

705
00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:47.000
Son, fighting!

706
00:41:49.664 --> 00:41:51.336
If you bully Hong Do
Unnie even one more time,

707
00:41:51.896 --> 00:41:53.640
I really won't stand for it.

708
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.216
Oh, what do you mean "bully"?

709
00:41:56.992 --> 00:41:58.856
Madam, please stop misunderstanding.

710
00:41:59.024 --> 00:42:01.576
Ms. Joo Gil Yeon, your contract will
be expiring soon, isn't that right?

711
00:42:01.864 --> 00:42:02.608
Well, yes.

712
00:42:03.368 --> 00:42:03.848
But,

713
00:42:04.216 --> 00:42:06.456
but why would Madam
mention the contract?

714
00:42:06.512 --> 00:42:07.392
Because it's mine.

715
00:42:08.624 --> 00:42:09.288
Omona!

716
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.480
It looks as if you don't know.

717
00:42:13.056 --> 00:42:15.960
It's been some time since the building
owner was changed to the General Manager.

718
00:42:16.456 --> 00:42:19.896
I remember that I had told you before,

719
00:42:20.472 --> 00:42:21.176
in the supermarket.

720
00:42:23.392 --> 00:42:26.096
I don't think there's much time left until
the store contract needs to be renewed.

721
00:42:26.336 --> 00:42:28.784
Should I raise it by another $20,000?

722
00:42:29.432 --> 00:42:31.600
Omona, Madam is really..

723
00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.896
I mean, even though you are
the wife of the building owner,

724
00:42:34.992 --> 00:42:36.648
If you speak that way,

725
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.736
you'll probably hear

726
00:42:39.136 --> 00:42:41.568
that you're trying to
throw your position around.

727
00:42:41.672 --> 00:42:43.008
The building owner is me.

728
00:42:43.288 --> 00:42:45.568
Well, of course, since you are
the wife of the General Manager,

729
00:42:45.768 --> 00:42:48.432
then what the General Manager owns, you
could be considered as owning it as well.

730
00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.424
Omona...

731
00:42:51.712 --> 00:42:53.704
It seems you really
didn't know about it.

732
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.696
Although I have heard
that you do nothing but

733
00:42:56.712 --> 00:43:00.260
live like a doll at home,
but what to do?

734
00:43:00.704 --> 00:43:02.432
I will confirm that,
then we can speak again.

735
00:43:02.472 --> 00:43:03.544
Well, okay.

736
00:43:04.192 --> 00:43:05.336
If you wish.

737
00:43:21.856 --> 00:43:22.520
Aigoo!

738
00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.608
I said I had a meeting!

739
00:43:25.944 --> 00:43:28.680
Jeez, you just do whatever you want,
when a man is trying to do some work.

740
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.344
Did you touch what's mine?

741
00:43:32.408 --> 00:43:32.664
Eh?

742
00:43:34.232 --> 00:43:34.950
Deed of Property Rights

743
00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.912
Reason: 8 October 2017 Deed of
Assignment Owner: Lee Byung Soo

744
00:43:44.352 --> 00:43:46.856
What's the fuss? Huh?

745
00:43:47.472 --> 00:43:50.760
I was going to tell you after I had
finished organizing everything. Hm?

746
00:43:51.424 --> 00:43:53.400
I'm ready to renovate everything nicely,

747
00:43:53.448 --> 00:43:55.448
expanding the building to
make it several times bigger.

748
00:43:55.648 --> 00:43:57.080
I have all the plans, and now,

749
00:43:57.104 --> 00:43:59.096
it only needs to be executed.

750
00:44:00.352 --> 00:44:01.472
Even if I tell you about
matters like these,

751
00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:02.984
you wouldn't understand.

752
00:44:03.576 --> 00:44:03.984
Why?

753
00:44:04.912 --> 00:44:06.456
Because I'm a doll who
only knows how to breathe?

754
00:44:08.352 --> 00:44:10.992
Aigoo... Why are you putting
yourself down like that?

755
00:44:11.136 --> 00:44:11.624
Huh?

756
00:44:12.696 --> 00:44:13.256
You

757
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.536
don't look good being that way, hm?

758
00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:17.176
A person...

759
00:44:17.408 --> 00:44:19.432
Must have some dignity.

760
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:21.200
You are...

761
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.536
Lee Byung Soo's wife.

762
00:44:23.952 --> 00:44:24.504
Hm?

763
00:44:25.032 --> 00:44:27.016
You have to have pride, Kim Jung Hye!

764
00:44:27.136 --> 00:44:27.384
Tch.

765
00:44:29.016 --> 00:44:30.088
See?

766
00:44:30.552 --> 00:44:31.552
Now you look better.

767
00:44:31.608 --> 00:44:32.624
You should smile like that.

768
00:44:33.312 --> 00:44:33.824
Smile.

769
00:44:34.176 --> 00:44:36.072
You seem to be under some delusion.

770
00:44:36.792 --> 00:44:37.488
You...

771
00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.384
Are nothing.

772
00:44:41.832 --> 00:44:44.360
A son-in-law who doesn't even get
any consideration from Geon Ah Group.

773
00:44:45.592 --> 00:44:48.480
An elder son in HaeRang Construction who
is losing out to his younger brother.

774
00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:52.456
He's not only low enough
to use his 19-year-old son,

775
00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.656
he's stealing his wife's
inheritance as well.

776
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:55.704
A useless jerk.

777
00:44:58.248 --> 00:44:59.040
That's you.

778
00:45:03.552 --> 00:45:04.448
Yah!

779
00:45:14.312 --> 00:45:16.192
Hyung, today it's my treat.

780
00:45:16.536 --> 00:45:17.032
Okay!

781
00:45:21.864 --> 00:45:22.312
Son,

782
00:45:23.392 --> 00:45:23.712
get in.

783
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.048
Who...?

784
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.344
Does your friend want to get in, too?

785
00:45:27.536 --> 00:45:28.704
We're going to go for a drive.

786
00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:32.592
You go ahead first.

787
00:45:35.784 --> 00:45:37.200
No, it's okay, friend,
you can get in, too.

788
00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:38.920
You want to go?

789
00:45:38.984 --> 00:45:40.168
Okay, goodbye.

790
00:45:45.624 --> 00:45:47.400
I said that your friend
should come with us!

791
00:45:47.448 --> 00:45:48.008
Just go quickly.

792
00:46:02.752 --> 00:46:03.352
What's this?

793
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.720
It's a sports car.

794
00:46:07.512 --> 00:46:08.696
The color is a killer, isn't it?

795
00:46:09.552 --> 00:46:10.024
Where did you get it?

796
00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:12.432
Where else?
Of course I used my own money to buy it.

797
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640
Where did the money come from?

798
00:46:15.256 --> 00:46:16.320
I earned it. Why?

799
00:46:16.416 --> 00:46:17.056
You earned it?

800
00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:18.296
How?

801
00:46:20.368 --> 00:46:22.640
With my strength, I gave birth to you.

802
00:46:22.984 --> 00:46:25.416
Then using that power, I got the money.

803
00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.360
From whom?

804
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.328
There is such a person.

805
00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:31.680
You think without your father and
that woman, I can't get money?

806
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.056
Surely...

807
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.136
If President Kim Jung Yoon contacts you,

808
00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:38.896
don't meet her.

809
00:46:41.816 --> 00:46:42.240
Why?

810
00:46:43.216 --> 00:46:43.800
Just because.

811
00:46:44.432 --> 00:46:45.664
Don't be used by her.

812
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.728
Is it President Kim Jung Yoon?!

813
00:46:49.624 --> 00:46:50.512
Omo!

814
00:46:51.448 --> 00:46:52.040
Omo... You

815
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.904
are such a good guesser...

816
00:46:54.104 --> 00:46:54.672
Are you crazy?!

817
00:46:55.888 --> 00:46:57.544
Oh, what's wrong with that?!

818
00:46:58.136 --> 00:46:59.152
This will be the last time.

819
00:47:00.848 --> 00:47:02.392
If you go around selling me again,

820
00:47:03.496 --> 00:47:04.952
then we will die together.

821
00:47:05.616 --> 00:47:06.632
How could you

822
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.272
talk so harshly to
your mom all the time?

823
00:47:09.776 --> 00:47:10.872
Talking nonsense about dying...

824
00:47:10.992 --> 00:47:12.112
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah!

825
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.552
Omo, no... Yah, yah... Yah!

826
00:47:13.752 --> 00:47:14.688
Yah, wait, yah... Omo!

827
00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:16.688
No... Yah.

828
00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:18.128
No, look.

829
00:47:18.592 --> 00:47:19.728
Yah, wait, no.

830
00:47:19.768 --> 00:47:20.536
Yah, that's mine.

831
00:47:20.616 --> 00:47:21.856
Yah. Yah, yah. Wait.

832
00:47:22.048 --> 00:47:22.448
Omo!

833
00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.032
Son!

834
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.224
Yah, that's my money!

835
00:47:27.216 --> 00:47:27.648
Son!

836
00:47:28.576 --> 00:47:29.488
Yah, that's my money!

837
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:30.984
Yah, bring it back!

838
00:47:39.864 --> 00:47:40.920
You don't have to be like this.

839
00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:42.296
Whatever's missing,
I'll replace it for you.

840
00:47:42.368 --> 00:47:42.952
No need.

841
00:47:44.176 --> 00:47:46.240
I had assumed I was giving
it to charity anyway.

842
00:47:46.624 --> 00:47:48.240
Then,
you can just donate it to another place.

843
00:47:51.184 --> 00:47:53.688
What that woman used to get the money,

844
00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.464
aren't you curious about it?

845
00:48:13.936 --> 00:48:14.620
2017 November Rumor in Chaebol Family

846
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.869
The youngest daughter from
G Group is estranging herself

847
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:17.376
from her husband and is going
around with a younger man.

848
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.752
It seems your stepmother
didn't tell you.

849
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:26.776
Did she see it?

850
00:48:27.976 --> 00:48:29.072
She's the main figure,
so she needed to see it.

851
00:48:29.264 --> 00:48:30.184
Please stop it now.

852
00:48:30.448 --> 00:48:32.216
That such a woman gave birth to you,

853
00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.592
you must want to deny it.

854
00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:36.648
Just like you, President?

855
00:48:39.992 --> 00:48:42.144
The fact that my stepmother
is your little sister,

856
00:48:42.832 --> 00:48:43.736
aren't you denying that?

857
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.784
So, is that how it comes across?

858
00:48:50.192 --> 00:48:51.488
This will not happen
again in the future.

859
00:48:56.632 --> 00:48:58.176
Why do you struggle so much?

860
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.624
Just stay quiet,

861
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.936
like your stepmother.

862
00:49:05.632 --> 00:49:08.144
No matter what her husband is doing
behind her back, she's able to live

863
00:49:08.744 --> 00:49:09.880
a comfortable, care-free life.

864
00:49:15.872 --> 00:49:16.656
Who says that?

865
00:49:21.472 --> 00:49:22.600
What did your husband say?

866
00:49:23.976 --> 00:49:25.832
Did he really take
away your inheritance?

867
00:49:26.624 --> 00:49:27.784
I will not let him off.

868
00:49:27.944 --> 00:49:28.416
Of course!

869
00:49:28.464 --> 00:49:29.768
You must teach him a good lesson.

870
00:49:30.544 --> 00:49:31.232
Hurry, eat up.

871
00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:33.488
After you eat, you have to gather
your strength to teach him a lesson.

872
00:49:34.384 --> 00:49:35.432
Yes. It's delicious.

873
00:49:36.472 --> 00:49:36.936
It is, isn't it?

874
00:49:37.688 --> 00:49:39.824
Now that Hong Sang Man, that person,
was also sent flying in one kick,

875
00:49:40.568 --> 00:49:41.968
my appetite has returned. Returned.

876
00:49:45.944 --> 00:49:46.536
Hello.

877
00:49:50.952 --> 00:49:51.304
Oh.

878
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.360
This must be where you
have your business.

879
00:49:53.456 --> 00:49:54.416
Ah, yes.

880
00:49:54.536 --> 00:49:55.568
Ah, how did you...?

881
00:49:56.072 --> 00:49:57.448
I wanted to buy some
ingredients to cook.

882
00:49:57.592 --> 00:49:58.584
Do you have squid?

883
00:49:59.240 --> 00:49:59.584
Yes.

884
00:49:59.904 --> 00:50:00.624
Unnie

885
00:50:01.088 --> 00:50:01.360
Water.

886
00:50:07.008 --> 00:50:08.120
I'll get it for you. How many?

887
00:50:08.752 --> 00:50:09.936
I think two should be enough.

888
00:50:32.448 --> 00:50:33.648
Are you close to my Unnie?

889
00:50:34.096 --> 00:50:35.248
This is the first time I've seen you.

890
00:50:35.448 --> 00:50:35.720
Yes?

891
00:50:38.136 --> 00:50:39.344
No, it's just that nearby,

892
00:50:40.008 --> 00:50:41.824
it's a wo-wood...

893
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.168
It's called Wood Story.
I opened a furniture workshop.

894
00:50:44.464 --> 00:50:46.064
He's a carpenter, a carpenter.

895
00:50:46.816 --> 00:50:47.752
I see.

896
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.512
Not even a pastor*, but a carpenter*?
*(single vowel apart)

897
00:50:53.256 --> 00:50:54.112
Thank you.

898
00:51:12.544 --> 00:51:13.328
Yes, President?

899
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.112
This time, I think it will
take a while to complete.

900
00:51:18.272 --> 00:51:18.592
Yes.

901
00:51:20.296 --> 00:51:22.008
Anyway,
I'll call you after it's finished.

902
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.800
Wood Story

903
00:51:43.496 --> 00:51:44.424
This must be the place.

904
00:51:45.792 --> 00:51:47.384
It looked as if they only
just knew each other.

905
00:51:47.768 --> 00:51:49.472
If Unnie finds out,
then she'll have words to say.

906
00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:50.432
No, it's not.

907
00:51:50.776 --> 00:51:52.864
This is the first time I've seen
Unnie with such an expression.

908
00:51:53.336 --> 00:51:54.936
What feeling did you get?

909
00:51:55.616 --> 00:51:57.152
Just in case he's a strange person,

910
00:51:57.168 --> 00:51:58.360
we should protect Unnie.

911
00:51:58.376 --> 00:51:58.800
Oh!

912
00:52:00.168 --> 00:52:00.936
Hurry, hurry.

913
00:52:31.224 --> 00:52:32.712
He seems like a good person.

914
00:52:33.176 --> 00:52:34.560
You can't tell just from
looking at his outer appearance.

915
00:52:34.912 --> 00:52:36.936
And we don't know what
he's making inside.

916
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.576
Oh, he said that he made furniture.

917
00:52:42.128 --> 00:52:43.944
Oh, let's go now, Jung Hye.

918
00:52:44.576 --> 00:52:45.040
Hurry, hurry.

919
00:52:59.552 --> 00:53:00.080
What is it?

920
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.096
I know, I know.

921
00:53:10.216 --> 00:53:11.384
You already knew about it, didn't you?

922
00:53:13.304 --> 00:53:14.184
But how did you...?

923
00:53:14.344 --> 00:53:15.496
I asked if you knew about it already.

924
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.248
Don't even talk about it!

925
00:53:17.448 --> 00:53:18.736
In order to settle this matter,

926
00:53:18.856 --> 00:53:21.032
I had to see President Kim Jung Yoon
and try to get on her good side.

927
00:53:21.552 --> 00:53:22.464
Aigoo...

928
00:53:22.656 --> 00:53:23.392
You already knew about this,

929
00:53:23.592 --> 00:53:25.648
but you did nothing and
let mother see this?

930
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.520
Well, what could I do?

931
00:53:28.208 --> 00:53:29.764
It's because you two
always go around together,

932
00:53:29.964 --> 00:53:31.520
that there is material
for things like this.

933
00:53:34.496 --> 00:53:36.672
Soo Gyum... Yah. Yah!

934
00:53:38.464 --> 00:53:40.128
That, that... Look at that rudeness.
That... That...

935
00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:43.880
I...

936
00:53:59.592 --> 00:54:00.704
Oh, you're here?

937
00:54:00.848 --> 00:54:01.392
What about dinner?

938
00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.910
Are you Principal Hong Sang Man?

939
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.350
I am.

940
00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.324
There are numerous reports
coming out that female teachers

941
00:54:27.524 --> 00:54:29.547
have been sexually harassed,
is that the truth?

942
00:54:29.747 --> 00:54:31.771
That family of the victim
who first reported it

943
00:54:31.971 --> 00:54:34.370
as a matter of conscience
was also subjected to harassment,

944
00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:35.110
do you acknowledge that to be true?

945
00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:38.600
That you dragged in a public official into
a false report that you made, is that true?

946
00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.491
Since it's in the middle
of the investigation,

947
00:54:40.691 --> 00:54:43.165
I can't say anything.
The truth will soon be revealed.

948
00:54:43.365 --> 00:54:45.840
There is a video of you
confessing and numerous witnesses.

949
00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:47.460
Everything was fabricated. Fabricated.

950
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:47.880
I'm busy.

951
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.440
Principal! Principal!

952
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:21.800
Hello?

953
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.480
President Lee, what's going on?

954
00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.255
The truth hasn't even been revealed yet.

955
00:55:28.455 --> 00:55:30.510
If you kick a person
out in one morning...?

956
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.640
Hello? Hello?

957
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.950
Principal Hong Sang Man?

958
00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.150
Yes.

959
00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.440
You need to come with us.

960
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:43.040
What is this?

961
00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.420
If you have anything to say, I suggest
waiting until you get to the station.

962
00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:47.240
I'm innocent!

963
00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.330
Because that was done separately
by General Manager Lee,

964
00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:02.640
I'm not familiar with the details.
I will check on it and get back to you.

965
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.840
That's not necessary.

966
00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:22.990
You have a good son.

967
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.850
He asked for a favor.

968
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:28.880
The child, you met him again?

969
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.020
He came here of his own will yesterday.

970
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.510
The money I gave his mother,

971
00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:36.210
he returned it before he left.

972
00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:42.190
He asked me to be on your side.

973
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:45.160
I have a favor to ask.

974
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:50.020
Let's first hear what you want.

975
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:52.310
Please be on my stepmother's side.

976
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.440
I don't think that's
something you can ask me for.

977
00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:59.660
In return I will do whatever you ask.

978
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:04.070
What can you do?

979
00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:06.490
I will become

980
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:08.900
a useless son to my father.

981
00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:14.320
That way, as you want,
my uncle will become the heir.

982
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:28.090
He asked me to make it so his
father can't touch your property.

983
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.320
For the adultery, you seemed to
have gotten something out of it.

984
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:35.370
He's only 18 years old.

985
00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.730
Don't bother with him.

986
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:37.790
Why?

987
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:41.300
He said he would become a useless son.

988
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:44.620
Aren't you curious how he will do that?

989
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.570
Don't think about using him.

990
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:53.350
Why don't you make a deal with me?

991
00:57:55.090 --> 00:57:55.740
A deal?

992
00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:00.230
Senior Hong,

993
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.150
why did you put yourself
in this situation?

994
00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:08.680
Did you think I thought
it would end up like this?

995
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:12.980
There's really nothing I can do.

996
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:16.770
I don't think we should be meeting
as often either for the time being.

997
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:18.570
You know my situation.

998
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:20.950
How can you talk like that?

999
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:23.290
In times like this,

1000
00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:26.930
we should be combining our strength.

1001
00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:29.960
The mood here is bleak,

1002
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.840
let's go somewhere
nicer and have a drink.

1003
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:34.610
I have another engagement
right now so I can't.

1004
00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:35.620
That's right.

1005
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:37.300
I think until things settle down,

1006
00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.070
you should keep a low profile.

1007
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:40.280
Also,

1008
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.900
people talk here at the office,

1009
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.410
so you should be careful
about coming here.

1010
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.160
You guys are too much.

1011
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:52.440
I don't even know if
I'll have to go to jail.

1012
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:55.610
But thinking of you like
my real little brothers,

1013
00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.460
do you know what I've even done?

1014
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.400
Avengers Club?

1015
00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.310
Did the letter come?

1016
00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.140
This morning, this was among the mail.

1017
00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:27.880
What is this?

1018
00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.840
What have you been up to that
something like this would be sent here.

1019
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:34.990
That letter. You sent it?

1020
00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.460
Avengers Club? What is it?

1021
00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:41.950
That's why you need me around.

1022
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:44.200
Listen carefully.

1023
00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.710
There are 3 members.

1024
00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:48.590
Your wife.

1025
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:50.520
Your wife.

1026
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:54.730
The last member is the fish monger.

1027
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.005
The one from the chicken fight?

1028
00:59:57.205 --> 00:59:59.110
That's right. That's right.

1029
00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:00.950
You were taken in by them.

1030
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:14.810
You think you're safe?

1031
01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:15.600
Me, too?

1032
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.710
Does Jung Hye

1033
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:21.080
seem the type of person
to serve and cook?

1034
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.530
Your food was amazing.

1035
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.570
Thank you.

1036
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.600
You... have a foolish side to you.

1037
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.290
These days,

1038
01:00:36.490 --> 01:00:39.030
I keep having moments of forgetfulness.

1039
01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:39.810
Ahhh!

1040
01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.010
There's something you remember,
isn't there?

1041
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.310
You think back carefully, too.

1042
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:47.700
Assholes!

1043
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.170
I'm going to kill you all!

1044
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.520
Ahh...

1045
01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.520
Son of...

1046
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.860
Ahhh... now that I think of it...

1047
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:58.440
You see, you see.

1048
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.240
That's right.

1049
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.020
So now we need to discuss what
we're going to do in the future.

1050
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:06.900
What now?

1051
01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:10.950
As for a lawyer, I'll ask around.

1052
01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:12.360
When the election is over,

1053
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.190
I'll help.

1054
01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:15.800
Are you really...?

1055
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.210
Oh, look at the time. I have to go.

1056
01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:19.730
Professor Baek.

1057
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:21.080
Professor Baek.

1058
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.130
You know how to leave, right?

1059
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:22.910
Hey!

1060
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.220
Lee Byung Soo

1061
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.600
Baek Young Pyo

1062
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.800
Hong Sang Man

1063
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:55.790
Joo Gil Yeon

1064
01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:57.460
Of the four...

1065
01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.660
One name is missing.

1066
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.150
Han Soo Ji

1067
01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.270
The person who gave birth to me.

1068
01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.450
Two we've taken care of.

1069
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.590
That leaves three left.

1070
01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:19.410
How to take care of the rest of them,

1071
01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.090
shall we make a plan?

1072
01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:27.450
Fish market owner!

1073
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:28.650
Come out!

1074
01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.650
Fishmonger!

1075
01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.940
I'm telling you to come out!

1076
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.460
Hong Sang Man?!

1077
01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:39.440
Come out!

1078
01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.540
I'm telling you come out!

1079
01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.540
Fishmonger!

1080
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:48.650
How did you know my address?

1081
01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:51.490
I'm the broken...

1082
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:53.110
I mean I'm the Principal.

1083
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:56.230
You think I couldn't get the
address of one contract teacher?

1084
01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.230
You should go quietly.

1085
01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.380
We'll call the police.

1086
01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.260
A-ven-gers CI - ub!

1087
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:10.940
I know

1088
01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.370
what you did!

1089
01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:26.540
Omo! Omo!

1090
01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:29.150
Hey,

1091
01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.850
you can't be here like this.
Hurry and get up!

1092
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:35.750
Ahhh...

1093
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:38.850
It's an NLA.

1094
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:40.770
NLA!

1095
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.570
What is he saying?

1096
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.570
You don't know?

1097
01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:50.590
Neighborhood leftover ajummas.

1098
01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:57.560
Let's bury him.

1099
01:03:58.170 --> 01:03:59.640
Let's just bury him.

1100
01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.130
Will this do?

1101
01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:02.710
Neighborhood leftover ajusshi.

1102
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:41.870

1103
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.590
Then the plan this time,
we've perfectly completed it, right?

1104
01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:03.620
There is one bastard left.

1105
01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.130
It seems that you've been running
around doing some fun things these days.

1106
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:07.870
Avengers Club.

1107
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:09.950
We'll have to sort you out soon.

1108
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.650
Avengers Club,

1109
01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:12.275
they say you're the leader.

1110
01:06:12.475 --> 01:06:13.700
Should I tell you? Here...

1111
01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.300
He said that they were going to have
another meeting at the house today,

1112
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.640
so I'll try to find something out.

1113
01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.010
Do I look as if I'm doing
this because I'm bored?

1114
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.010
Lee Byung Soo, I will take him on.

1115
01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:23.810
You'll have to find a person for me.

1116
01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:27.910
Aren't you curious how I
took care of Lee Byung Soo?

1117
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.050
Surely...?

1118
01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:32.930
