<i>[This program is suitable
for viewers ages 15 and up.]</i>

3
00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:24.295
<i>Do you know why I came here?</i>

4
00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:32.877
<i>I ended up finding out.</i>

5
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.880
<i>[Internal Medicine]</i>

6
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.796
She's had indigestion
and gas for a long time now.

7
00:00:41.796 --> 00:00:45.207
How long has she taken this medicine for?

8
00:00:45.207 --> 00:00:47.331
It's been a long time.

9
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:50.140
She sets an alarm
so she never forgets to take it.

10
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.901
Is it indigestion?

11
00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:55.930
- Father.
- Yeah?

12
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.094
- This...
- Yeah?

13
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.504
<i>He said you have cancer.</i>

14
00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:33.055
Let's go home.

15
00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:35.552
Wait, come here for a second.

16
00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:39.180
- Aren't we going home?
- I told you to come here for a second.

17
00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.650
<i>[High-quality France Premium Package]</i>

18
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:49.430
I asked the kids to print it out.
Let's go there.

19
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.516
- What about the restaurant?
- We can take a few days off.

20
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:57.692
You make it sound like we're
well-off. It's company picnic season.

21
00:01:57.692 --> 00:02:00.010
Do you want to get cursed at
by our regular customers?

22
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.734
Let's go. You said it was
your dream to go to France.

23
00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:06.662
- When?
- You said it while watching a movie.

24
00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:10.561
You said you wouldn't want anything else
if you could go there. What was it?

25
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.075
It was a movie with a princess in it.

26
00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.681
"Roman Holiday"?

27
00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:19.477
- Was it Rome?
- Yes.

28
00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:23.572
Rome and France are the same.
Let's go and have fun just the two of us.

29
00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:25.913
Just the two of us? What about the kids?

30
00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:30.150
We don't have money for all of us
to go! Let's go just the two of us.

31
00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:35.955
I really don't want to go,
just the two of us...

32
00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.181
Let's go.

33
00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:45.002
<i>I thought you'd be really happy.</i>

34
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:46.830
Two tickets, yes.

35
00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.860
Yes, yes.

36
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.114
This is why I didn't want to go
on a vacation with you.

37
00:03:00.861 --> 00:03:03.515
I really hate you.

38
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:26.174
<i>[I lived like a fool.]</i>

39
00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:49.510
I didn't mean it like that.

40
00:03:51.407 --> 00:03:54.790
- So So.
- I want to listen to the music.

41
00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:04.169
You can still hear the music, right?

42
00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.156
Should I close my eyes?
I'd still be able to hear the music.

43
00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:09.860
- You don't want to see me?
- Yes.

44
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.355
Do I suck because I gave you
a warning without knowing anything?

45
00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:15.548
- Yes.
- Are you disappointed?

46
00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:17.076
Very much.

47
00:04:20.423 --> 00:04:22.245
So So, you still have a long way to go.

48
00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:26.440
You said you followed
a man here and got married.

49
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.762
Don't bring that up.

50
00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:29.839
You can't go home
now that the man is gone.

51
00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.446
- San Ma Ru.
- You're ashamed to see your family

52
00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:36.007
so you're getting your PhD
as if you're being punished.

53
00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.103
Why do you despise yourself so much?

54
00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:43.838
You said I was right
to fight against my company.

55
00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:47.290
My company is suing me
for 1.4 billion won.

56
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.031
For disturbing their business
and exposing secret information.

57
00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.283
What do you think?

58
00:04:56.372 --> 00:05:00.358
Can you still say...
I did the right thing?

59
00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.377
You didn't do anything wrong.

60
00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:06.572
That's what I wanted to say.
You did nothing wrong.

61
00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:10.315
It's not wrong for you to be
hung up on your past.

62
00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:15.355
Will you sit down?

63
00:05:30.923 --> 00:05:36.237
The wrong thing to do...
would be to forget about it.

64
00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:37.985
Without any worries.

65
00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:42.105
I... just like this place.

66
00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:46.266
My job isn't bad.
I'm not forcing myself to endure it.

67
00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:48.208
What do you really want to do?

68
00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:52.439
What do you really want to say
besides telling me to go back to Korea?

69
00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:53.994
Come back to Korea.

70
00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:57.038
Are you kidding me?

71
00:05:58.771 --> 00:06:00.675
Come back to Korea and date me.

72
00:06:00.675 --> 00:06:03.086
If you go back to France
after that, I'll come to you.

73
00:06:03.086 --> 00:06:06.062
I can't come here every time.

74
00:06:06.062 --> 00:06:11.321
I mean, I can come, but I won't see
you often, and it'll be expensive.

75
00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:13.358
I'm not saying
it's a waste of money, though.

76
00:06:13.358 --> 00:06:14.985
What is this?

77
00:06:16.326 --> 00:06:17.673
A proposal.

78
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.572
How can a proposal be so logical?

79
00:06:24.572 --> 00:06:26.697
I don't feel anything.

80
00:06:27.384 --> 00:06:29.004
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:29.004 --> 00:06:31.432
You ruined our date.

82
00:06:32.132 --> 00:06:33.430
About my proposal...

83
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.949
There are too many things
we don't know about each other.

84
00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.281
- Tomorrow is our last day.
- Then, I'll answer you tomorrow.

85
00:06:41.281 --> 00:06:43.360
What will your answer be?

86
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.367
I'll just follow my heart.

87
00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:47.430
I can't see the stage.

88
00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:50.769
Then look at me instead.

89
00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:26.872
The High-quality France Premium Package.

90
00:07:26.872 --> 00:07:28.790
Are you aware that today is the last day?

91
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.067
Yes!

92
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.646
You don't have to answer me.

93
00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:35.867
After we take pictures
at a special location

94
00:07:35.867 --> 00:07:39.266
we will pass Pont Neuf
and visit Place de la Concorde.

95
00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:44.689
And then we'll go to the Louvre and
Notre-Dame de Paris on this exciting day.

96
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:49.107
I contemplated long and hard about
where to take our commemorative pictures.

97
00:07:49.107 --> 00:07:52.591
- Are you curious about the reason?
- Yes!

98
00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:55.139
You don't have to answer me.

99
00:07:55.139 --> 00:07:59.067
In most packages, the Eiffel Tower
observatory is included.

100
00:07:59.067 --> 00:08:03.418
But if you go there,
you just think, "Wow, it's high."

101
00:08:03.418 --> 00:08:06.166
It's similar to what you see
when you take off or land on a plane.

102
00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:11.322
But the place
we're going to is very different.

103
00:08:11.322 --> 00:08:15.925
It's not an observatory. But you can
see the most beautiful view of Paris.

104
00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:23.415
Did everyone fight?
Why does everyone look down?

105
00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:26.711
I guess this is a family-like
atmosphere after all.

106
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:29.781
You know that families
fight the most, right?

107
00:08:30.355 --> 00:08:34.274
We're going to get off, so remember to
take your passports, wallets, and phones!

108
00:08:34.274 --> 00:08:35.458
Yes!

109
00:08:43.908 --> 00:08:46.687
Father, what does this place
remind you of?

110
00:08:46.687 --> 00:08:49.293
Where else? It looks like France.

111
00:08:49.293 --> 00:08:51.837
- Is it a good place to grill meat?
- No way.

112
00:08:51.837 --> 00:08:53.663
This is a classy place.

113
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.259
This is the first Paris observatory.

114
00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:02.249
Take a look around,
and meet back here in 15 minutes.

115
00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:04.725
- Yes.
- Yes.

116
00:09:12.437 --> 00:09:15.964
- Let's take a picture.
- Later.

117
00:09:15.964 --> 00:09:18.879
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Do you
want me to take a picture of you?

118
00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:21.590
That's okay. I don't feel
like taking pictures.

119
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.341
- Don't you know what day it is?
- Excuse me.

120
00:09:26.326 --> 00:09:27.418
I was wondering...

121
00:09:27.418 --> 00:09:30.581
Would you like a picture?
Fom the waist up?

122
00:09:30.581 --> 00:09:34.635
No, you took a good one last time,
so you can take it freely this time.

123
00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:36.964
Then, I'll make you look like
an actress this time.

124
00:09:36.964 --> 00:09:39.581
Hey, I could never be an actress.

125
00:09:39.581 --> 00:09:42.739
- Where should I stand? Here?
- Move back a bit.

126
00:09:42.739 --> 00:09:45.196
Yes, that's good. I'll take it now.

127
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:49.187
- You're doing that again.
- What?

128
00:09:49.187 --> 00:09:52.385
- Pose in a sexy way.
- Gosh, how could I?

129
00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:54.738
- Like this?
- Great!

130
00:09:55.341 --> 00:09:58.138
Then, pose in a cute way this time.

131
00:10:02.193 --> 00:10:04.350
Gosh, I can't do this!

132
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.720
Then, look out into the distance
in a romantic way.

133
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.697
You're asking for all sorts of things.

134
00:10:10.697 --> 00:10:14.196
Wow! You're so pretty!

135
00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:16.365
<i>Did you know?</i>

136
00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:20.672
<i>I hate the sight of you taking pictures.</i>

137
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.669
Get up already! You're so stubborn!

138
00:10:25.669 --> 00:10:28.528
Just one picture.

139
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.832
Why would you take a funeral photo
if we came here for a passport photo?

140
00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:36.546
- Are we dying on vacation?
- I might as well since I'm here.

141
00:10:36.546 --> 00:10:40.173
If I take it now,
he'll give me a 20 percent discount.

142
00:10:40.173 --> 00:10:41.760
Get up so we can go home!

143
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.888
These days, people don't call them
funeral pictures as if it's unlucky.

144
00:10:45.888 --> 00:10:47.977
If you take it early,
you'll receive more luck...

145
00:10:47.977 --> 00:10:51.390
You're just trying to sell your
service! I want to talk to your boss!

146
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.721
Fine, I won't take it. Stop it.
I won't take it. Let's go.

147
00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:58.000
- How dare you...
- I'm sorry. I'll be back.

148
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.975
- Let go!
- Stop it!

149
00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:03.201
<i>It's because you only think about
dying instead of fighting to live.</i>

150
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:04.692
<i>I had my reasons.</i>

151
00:11:04.692 --> 00:11:06.400
Don't take her funeral photo!

152
00:11:12.054 --> 00:11:14.630
- Gosh, what is this?
- It turned out well!

153
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.234
Erase this one. Erase it.

154
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:20.567
<i>You're so pretty when you smile.</i>

155
00:11:21.738 --> 00:11:24.350
<i>You're beautiful, no matter
how much I look at you.</i>

156
00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:31.269
- Come here.
- Don't boss an elder around.

157
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:34.355
Gosh, I'll take a picture of both of you.

158
00:11:34.974 --> 00:11:37.913
You're a photographer now, huh?

159
00:11:37.913 --> 00:11:40.775
Ready? Smile!

160
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:44.157
Mister, try to smile.

161
00:11:44.157 --> 00:11:47.572
- Hurry up.
- Ma'am, link arms.

162
00:11:52.544 --> 00:11:54.686
Mister, it'd be
so much better if you smiled!

163
00:11:54.686 --> 00:11:59.011
Big Sis, you don't listen.
You should just take it...

164
00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:00.999
Did you take it while I was talking?

165
00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:04.083
- What the heck?
- You're too much.

166
00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:05.828
It didn't turn out well.

167
00:12:07.551 --> 00:12:10.384
Let me see if it turned out well.

168
00:12:10.384 --> 00:12:12.397
She said it didn't turn out well.

169
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.855
<i>They say you should refuse
the first time around.</i>

170
00:12:20.855 --> 00:12:24.464
<i>I was planning to smile
and hold your hand</i>

171
00:12:24.464 --> 00:12:26.644
<i>after the first few shots.</i>

172
00:12:37.947 --> 00:12:40.740
That dress was a little over 100 euros.

173
00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.914
It's cheaper than I thought.

174
00:12:42.914 --> 00:12:46.576
But I don't have a reason
to wear it, so it's a waste for me.

175
00:12:46.576 --> 00:12:50.306
- Is that shop hard to find?
- It's right behind the hotel.

176
00:12:50.306 --> 00:12:53.630
Take the back door, turn left, take
the first alleyway and walk one minute.

177
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.673
It's close. That's a relief.

178
00:12:55.673 --> 00:13:00.042
Another tourist from
the last group bought five of them.

179
00:13:00.042 --> 00:13:03.000
- It was for her friend's wedding.
- Amazing.

180
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.365
There must have been a lot of tension.
You know how it is among friends.

181
00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:09.836
You're right. There's always that
one friend you can't stand.

182
00:13:09.836 --> 00:13:13.476
You have to look prettier
when they get married.

183
00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:14.768
You're right.

184
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:20.106
Women become friends so easily.

185
00:13:20.106 --> 00:13:23.298
I know, right? Isn't it fascinating?

186
00:13:23.837 --> 00:13:26.186
Look at her excitement.

187
00:13:27.394 --> 00:13:29.481
Your girlfriend is beautiful.

188
00:13:29.481 --> 00:13:33.062
Pardon? Your girlfriend is beautiful too.

189
00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:34.480
Thank you.

190
00:13:37.989 --> 00:13:40.683
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

191
00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:49.822
- You were in the search forces, right?
- Yes.

192
00:13:49.822 --> 00:13:52.778
- In the army forces?
- No, in the 505 special forces.

193
00:13:52.778 --> 00:13:54.856
505...

194
00:13:54.856 --> 00:13:56.962
- Below the mountain?
- You know?

195
00:13:56.962 --> 00:14:01.370
Of course! If you head toward Seoul from
there, there's an industrial complex.

196
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.745
- Yes, there is.
- That's where I was.

197
00:14:03.745 --> 00:14:05.293
With 505...

198
00:14:05.293 --> 00:14:08.865
Men become friends so easily.

199
00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:11.927
I know, right? Isn't it fascinating?

200
00:14:11.927 --> 00:14:13.318
Then...

201
00:14:15.794 --> 00:14:17.825
What do you think they're doing?

202
00:14:18.565 --> 00:14:22.614
I'm not even curious.
He's so frustrating.

203
00:14:22.614 --> 00:14:25.918
But your boyfriend is very handsome.

204
00:14:25.918 --> 00:14:31.169
He's not that handsome.
Your boyfriend is much more handsome.

205
00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:33.301
I don't have a boyfriend.

206
00:14:34.346 --> 00:14:36.756
I'll call you if I can't find the shop.

207
00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:43.307
I can't believe I met you here.

208
00:15:20.865 --> 00:15:24.048
This is the Pont Neuf bridge
which was in the movie

209
00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.323
"The Lovers on the Bridge."

210
00:15:26.323 --> 00:15:29.417
"Pont" means bridge,
and "Neuf" means new.

211
00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:31.888
So it means "new bridge."

212
00:15:32.465 --> 00:15:37.490
I think "Pont Neuf" is a word that
completes the romance of Paris.

213
00:15:38.116 --> 00:15:42.222
Take a leisurely stroll, have a chat

214
00:15:42.222 --> 00:15:46.582
and talk about why
you came here on vacation.

215
00:15:57.443 --> 00:15:59.039
Yes, Big Brother.

216
00:16:00.736 --> 00:16:03.368
Pardon? Today?

217
00:16:07.263 --> 00:16:09.898
Yes, thank you. Yes, have a good night.

218
00:16:09.898 --> 00:16:11.663
Yes. Yes.

219
00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:15.724
So Ran, the investment decision
will be made today.

220
00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:19.721
I passed the final round.
All that's left is the CEO's approval.

221
00:16:20.739 --> 00:16:22.519
Then it's not decided yet.

222
00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:25.967
It's pretty much decided.
The CEO's approval is just a formality.

223
00:16:25.967 --> 00:16:29.168
Okay, I really hope it works out.

224
00:16:29.168 --> 00:16:31.942
Geez, can't you be happy with me?

225
00:16:31.942 --> 00:16:33.917
I'm happy.

226
00:16:33.917 --> 00:16:36.889
So Ran, I'll do a good job.

227
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:38.490
I'll do a really good job.

228
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:44.198
I'll only put business cards that I'll
keep for years in the wallet you gave me.

229
00:16:44.821 --> 00:16:46.451
I'll stick to it.

230
00:16:48.928 --> 00:16:50.289
Okay.

231
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.530
<i>[2,555 days]</i>

232
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.605
<i>[Seven years]</i>

233
00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.960
<i>It's been around 27 or 28 years
since we got together.</i>

234
00:17:27.116 --> 00:17:30.844
<i>I wasn't in the best situation,
so you had a hard time.</i>

235
00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:35.066
<i>I know you had a hard time.</i>

236
00:17:43.038 --> 00:17:46.874
You're driving me crazy.
Is this a coffee shop?

237
00:17:46.874 --> 00:17:49.758
Why did you bring coffee machines
into this restaurant?

238
00:17:49.758 --> 00:17:53.395
Americano with chicken?
It looks like we'll be on the news!

239
00:17:53.395 --> 00:17:57.134
A cup of coffee after a meal
would be so nice.

240
00:17:57.134 --> 00:17:59.987
This alone will make us
100 million won a month.

241
00:17:59.987 --> 00:18:02.647
Who told you that?

242
00:18:02.647 --> 00:18:06.772
These coffee machines
cost 8.24 million won each

243
00:18:06.772 --> 00:18:11.441
but we bought 500 of them
to lend to coffee shop establishments.

244
00:18:11.931 --> 00:18:14.314
If you buy three, you'll be a chief.

245
00:18:14.314 --> 00:18:16.939
If you buy six, you'll be the director.

246
00:18:16.939 --> 00:18:21.230
If you buy 9, you'll be
the chief director. If you buy 12...

247
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.288
you'll become the president,
with an official business license.

248
00:18:25.288 --> 00:18:28.098
Who? All of you.

249
00:18:28.098 --> 00:18:33.880
If you invest this much money into this
business, how much will you make a month?

250
00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:36.034
100 million won!

251
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.517
100 million won!

252
00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:42.701
This is how you make money, everyone.

253
00:18:50.146 --> 00:18:52.440
So, how many did you buy?

254
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.660
I'm a director now.

255
00:18:59.592 --> 00:19:01.576
You bought six of them?

256
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.402
We're rich now, too.

257
00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:10.405
<i>At the time,
I thought I developed cancer.</i>

258
00:19:13.727 --> 00:19:17.085
Wow, this is nice.

259
00:19:18.355 --> 00:19:22.377
A raw fish restaurant and a fish
stew restaurant needs to be here.

260
00:19:22.377 --> 00:19:26.366
I'll use the nets,
and you can use the fishing rods.

261
00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:27.994
That'll keep us busy.

262
00:19:28.594 --> 00:19:30.781
Here, we'll open the Seine river
raw fish restaurant.

263
00:19:30.781 --> 00:19:33.989
And over there, we'll open
the Pont Neuf fish stew restaurant.

264
00:19:33.989 --> 00:19:36.810
Fish stew, raw fish, fish stew, raw fish.

265
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:41.374
That'd be great. We can expand
our business and make a lot of money.

266
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.611
And we can live happily
for a very long time.

267
00:20:54.757 --> 00:20:58.114
<i>Your legs will hurt.
Sit down and get some rest.</i>

268
00:21:06.121 --> 00:21:07.326
<i>Are you a stalker?</i>

269
00:21:09.063 --> 00:21:10.807
<i>We just got here.</i>

270
00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:14.996
<i>Do you remember
the first time we came here?</i>

271
00:21:16.884 --> 00:21:19.281
<i>Nothing memorable happened that day.</i>

272
00:21:20.348 --> 00:21:21.938
<i>Are you taking it off?</i>

273
00:21:29.153 --> 00:21:31.726
<i>Typo! Typo! I mean, really?</i>

274
00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:33.086
<i>It was a typo!</i>

275
00:21:36.034 --> 00:21:37.980
<i>I was just about to block you.</i>

276
00:21:41.069 --> 00:21:44.105
<i>After today's agenda,
spend time with me.</i>

277
00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:49.385
<i>You're becoming more direct over time.</i>

278
00:22:10.435 --> 00:22:13.508
224 years ago, Marie Antoinette

279
00:22:13.508 --> 00:22:16.663
was executed here,
at Place de la Concorde.

280
00:22:16.663 --> 00:22:20.916
They accused her of squandering money
for her extravagant lifestyle

281
00:22:20.916 --> 00:22:25.031
as well as various other reasons,
but it was all a lie.

282
00:22:25.031 --> 00:22:26.662
All of it.

283
00:22:26.662 --> 00:22:29.893
They simply hated her.

284
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:35.500
As Marie Antoinette died miserably
due to the hatred, she said this.

285
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.882
People are only able to discover
who they are when they're unhappy.

286
00:22:42.637 --> 00:22:44.499
<i>Big Sis Guide is right.</i>

287
00:22:45.135 --> 00:22:50.419
<i>After you got sick, I realized who I was.</i>

288
00:22:53.695 --> 00:22:55.521
<i>I'm a fool.</i>

289
00:22:56.295 --> 00:22:58.980
<i>I can't live on without you.</i>

290
00:22:59.556 --> 00:23:01.932
<i>I went to a cathedral
for the first time in my life.</i>

291
00:23:01.932 --> 00:23:03.432
Father...

292
00:23:05.105 --> 00:23:06.843
<i>And I even went to temples.</i>

293
00:23:08.442 --> 00:23:11.461
<i>I couldn't do anything but pray.</i>

294
00:23:11.461 --> 00:23:16.690
Have you ever prayed for me?

295
00:23:21.286 --> 00:23:23.201
<i>You haven't, have you?</i>

296
00:23:41.901 --> 00:23:43.144
Huh?

297
00:23:44.056 --> 00:23:45.309
What is it?

298
00:23:47.363 --> 00:23:48.717
Over there.

299
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.184
This is weird.

300
00:23:52.184 --> 00:23:54.666
They're not the type to stick together.

301
00:23:54.666 --> 00:24:00.183
I know, right? This is the most
unbelievable sight I've seen in France.

302
00:24:05.914 --> 00:24:08.141
- You startled me!
- You scared me!

303
00:24:08.141 --> 00:24:10.872
Why are you standing there
without saying a word?

304
00:24:10.872 --> 00:24:13.403
- You're too much.
- Why?

305
00:24:13.403 --> 00:24:15.094
I thought you were a ghost!

306
00:24:17.968 --> 00:24:20.555
I thought you were a ghost!

307
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.107
Big Sis, I heard there's
a baguette sandwich shop here.

308
00:24:28.107 --> 00:24:31.701
Yes, there's a delicious shop here.
How did you know?

309
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:35.497
How about we take a break
at the park with some sandwiches?

310
00:24:35.497 --> 00:24:38.660
We can go people watching. I'll buy them.

311
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.866
I like that idea. But we still
have a few things left to do.

312
00:24:42.866 --> 00:24:45.835
- Then, should we buy them together?
- Yes.

313
00:24:59.094 --> 00:25:00.958
<i>I hate the sight of her.</i>

314
00:25:02.351 --> 00:25:06.132
<i>Why would she buy bread for someone
who's having a hard time eating?</i>

315
00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:13.435
<i>Stop it. Thanks to her, I regained
my strength so I could lift the pyramid.</i>

316
00:25:14.961 --> 00:25:18.329
I'll take it now. One, two.

317
00:25:18.992 --> 00:25:20.928
Great, who's next?

318
00:25:25.846 --> 00:25:29.022
Ready? One, two.

319
00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.564
Again. Again.

320
00:25:45.415 --> 00:25:48.615
I'll take it now. One, two.

321
00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:59.912
Don't be surprised when they
check your belongings at the gate.

322
00:25:59.912 --> 00:26:02.391
You know what you need to
take a picture of, right?

323
00:26:02.391 --> 00:26:04.510
- Mona Lisa.
- That's right.

324
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.355
"Mona" is a title that was
given to married women

325
00:26:07.355 --> 00:26:09.929
and "Lisa" was the model's name.

326
00:26:09.929 --> 00:26:13.800
If you translate it,
it would be "Madam Lisa."

327
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.817
It's a world-famous painting, so try
to take a picture even if it's hard.

328
00:26:17.817 --> 00:26:20.929
- Will someone stop us?
- It's not that

329
00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:23.932
but imagine yourself taking
a picture of Mona Lisa.

330
00:26:27.305 --> 00:26:29.463
<i>You'd strike your best pose.</i>

331
00:26:30.726 --> 00:26:33.570
<i>And elegantly admire the work.</i>

332
00:26:34.653 --> 00:26:37.980
That will be hard to do.
You'll see when you get inside.

333
00:26:38.538 --> 00:26:41.645
Father, you didn't wear
your hiking attire today.

334
00:26:41.645 --> 00:26:44.740
What? Is hiking attire banned?

335
00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.288
- It's not that...
- Is there a museum attire?

336
00:26:47.288 --> 00:26:48.779
Comfort is key.

337
00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:53.404
Let's go inside.
I'll wait for you at the exit.

338
00:27:06.377 --> 00:27:14.353
<i>Let nothing...</i>

339
00:27:14.353 --> 00:27:22.400
<i>make you sad.</i>

340
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:29.592
<i>Let nothing...</i>

341
00:27:29.592 --> 00:27:35.990
<i>frighten you.</i>

342
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.880
Hey, Bae Hyung Goo!

343
00:27:41.364 --> 00:27:43.818
Hey, get lost.

344
00:27:45.536 --> 00:27:46.945
Again.

345
00:27:48.202 --> 00:27:49.593
Hey, stay back.

346
00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:51.817
Don't come near me.

347
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.617
Don't come here.

348
00:27:54.617 --> 00:27:55.868
Hey!

349
00:27:56.617 --> 00:27:58.002
I'll hit you!

350
00:28:00.395 --> 00:28:02.421
Hey, call the police!

351
00:28:03.654 --> 00:28:05.909
Don't come near me! Don't...

352
00:28:11.711 --> 00:28:14.826
What's wrong? Are you
threatening me with self-harm?

353
00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:18.626
I came here to thank you.

354
00:28:19.721 --> 00:28:21.776
I came back from seeing my sister.

355
00:28:21.776 --> 00:28:25.105
And she's still pretty, kind, and cool.

356
00:28:25.105 --> 00:28:28.067
I always thought she was
too good for you.

357
00:28:28.067 --> 00:28:30.476
So thanks for leaving her early.

358
00:28:36.693 --> 00:28:39.608
Here, buy some pain relief patches.

359
00:28:39.608 --> 00:28:41.919
I don't want to see you again,
Bae Hyung Goo.

360
00:28:44.214 --> 00:28:47.026
I didn't do anything. He fell on his own.

361
00:28:47.026 --> 00:28:48.431
Hey!

362
00:28:50.597 --> 00:28:52.096
Hey, stop right there.

363
00:28:54.078 --> 00:28:55.358
Did you beat him up?

364
00:28:56.076 --> 00:28:57.682
- No.
- Why not?

365
00:28:57.682 --> 00:29:00.365
- I'd be a repeated offender.
- You have a criminal record already

366
00:29:00.365 --> 00:29:02.287
so you might as well
beat him up one more time.

367
00:29:04.364 --> 00:29:07.993
What? Are you touched by how pretty I am?

368
00:29:09.577 --> 00:29:14.873
I... lived as an upright person
until now because of my sister.

369
00:29:14.873 --> 00:29:17.041
Yeah, it's all thanks to So So.

370
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:22.083
But from now on,
I'll live as an upright person for you.

371
00:29:22.083 --> 00:29:23.922
I promise.

372
00:29:23.922 --> 00:29:26.012
I'm speechless.

373
00:29:26.012 --> 00:29:29.105
It's something you would have said
on our first night after getting married.

374
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:34.258
Do you think we'll have time to talk
on our first night after getting married?

375
00:29:34.258 --> 00:29:35.642
Of course not.

376
00:29:37.664 --> 00:29:42.113
That punk was so surprised when
he saw me, that he fell of the stage.

377
00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:45.568
- Really?
- Yeah, I think he injured his back.

378
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.496
What are you doing?

379
00:30:16.321 --> 00:30:17.571
What are you doing?

380
00:30:19.433 --> 00:30:22.559
- Why are you startled?
- Why are you here already?

381
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.647
I thought you'd be bored by yourself.

382
00:30:24.647 --> 00:30:25.867
What about the museum?

383
00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:28.097
I saw the Mona Lisa
and came out right away.

384
00:30:28.097 --> 00:30:30.812
You can't tour a museum
so half-heartedly.

385
00:30:30.812 --> 00:30:34.564
- I was afraid you'd be bored.
- Are you going to entertain me?

386
00:30:34.564 --> 00:30:38.060
Yes, give me your phone.
I'll take a picture of you.

387
00:30:47.084 --> 00:30:50.316
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E11 The Package</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

388
00:30:59.718 --> 00:31:02.176
Why are there so many people?

389
00:31:02.176 --> 00:31:05.869
I mean, it's not like Mona Lisa
is going anywhere.

390
00:31:05.869 --> 00:31:09.888
Why is everyone clustered
together to see it?

391
00:31:09.888 --> 00:31:11.436
Damn it.

392
00:31:12.898 --> 00:31:15.823
- How do I look?
- I'm almost ready. Wait.

393
00:31:17.465 --> 00:31:19.958
I'll take it now. One, two three.

394
00:31:19.958 --> 00:31:21.648
This is hard.

395
00:31:21.648 --> 00:31:23.506
Again. Take it one more time.

396
00:31:23.506 --> 00:31:26.611
One, two, three!

397
00:31:27.862 --> 00:31:29.314
Wow.

398
00:31:31.358 --> 00:31:32.590
Is that it?

399
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.977
This is good for my first shot.

400
00:31:34.977 --> 00:31:37.637
Take it again. Again.

401
00:31:37.637 --> 00:31:39.234
You're picky.

402
00:31:41.386 --> 00:31:44.042
Ready? Move to the left.

403
00:31:44.991 --> 00:31:47.028
Bend a little more!

404
00:31:47.028 --> 00:31:49.350
- One... one...
- Oh no.

405
00:31:52.946 --> 00:31:54.724
Geez, you're cute.

406
00:31:57.821 --> 00:31:59.283
One more time.

407
00:32:00.721 --> 00:32:04.053
You can't take pictures
like that. Erase it.

408
00:32:04.053 --> 00:32:06.291
This is your phone.

409
00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:08.201
Don't erase it, okay?

410
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:10.704
It's time to assemble!

411
00:32:13.953 --> 00:32:16.600
We're late. I'm going crazy.

412
00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:18.029
<i>Notre-Dame de Paris was destroyed in the
French Revolution of the 18th century.</i>

413
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:21.726
<i>It was left alone until
the beginning of the 19th century.</i>

414
00:33:21.726 --> 00:33:25.957
<i>But it was so hideous, that the city
thought about tearing it down.</i>

415
00:33:25.957 --> 00:33:29.539
That was when a writer who wanted
to protect the cathedral's tradition

416
00:33:29.539 --> 00:33:32.677
started to write. As a result

417
00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:36.840
<i>he wrote "Notre-Dame de Paris,"
known as "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame."</i>

418
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.044
<i>Victor Hugo's novel brought
a lot of attention to the cathedral.</i>

419
00:33:41.044 --> 00:33:44.426
<i>And the citizens grouped together
to protect the cathedral.</i>

420
00:33:44.426 --> 00:33:50.946
In the end, the cathedral was rebuilt,
and we're here for our last stop.

421
00:33:50.946 --> 00:33:54.485
Now, we'll go to the center of Paris.

422
00:33:54.485 --> 00:33:57.490
Please hold hands and form a circle!

423
00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:01.005
It's a little awkward, though.

424
00:34:06.416 --> 00:34:09.659
Point Zero.
It's also Point Zero in French.

425
00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:11.978
This is the center of Paris.

426
00:34:11.978 --> 00:34:17.143
They say, if you step on Point Zero,
you'll come back to Paris.

427
00:34:23.203 --> 00:34:27.623
Everyone, thank you for coming to Paris.

428
00:34:27.623 --> 00:34:32.864
And I'm thankful that I was your guide,
among countless other guides.

429
00:34:32.864 --> 00:34:38.449
And I hope you cherish
and love the time you spent in Paris.

430
00:34:39.927 --> 00:34:43.136
I hope we meet again.

431
00:34:43.136 --> 00:34:45.089
- Yes!
- Yes.

432
00:34:45.089 --> 00:34:46.386
Yes.

433
00:34:56.382 --> 00:34:57.690
What are you doing?

434
00:35:06.906 --> 00:35:09.440
<i>I can't come back anyway.</i>

435
00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:11.797
<i>Not me.</i>

436
00:35:12.853 --> 00:35:14.223
Step on it.

437
00:35:17.029 --> 00:35:20.034
<i>Stop thinking that you're going to die.</i>

438
00:35:35.922 --> 00:35:38.388
<i>Do you know how mad I was?</i>

439
00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:43.792
<i>I was praying for you to live a long life</i>

440
00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:47.156
<i>but you were getting
ready to die before winter.</i>

441
00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.699
<i>You're not going to die.</i>

442
00:35:54.272 --> 00:35:57.199
<i>Not everyone dies from cancer.</i>

443
00:37:00.395 --> 00:37:02.226
You said you'd answer me today.

444
00:37:03.194 --> 00:37:04.922
About my proposal yesterday.

445
00:37:07.614 --> 00:37:10.083
I waited all day for this.

446
00:37:10.083 --> 00:37:13.723
- Aren't you tired?
- No.

447
00:37:14.953 --> 00:37:17.882
Do you have an international license?

448
00:37:17.882 --> 00:37:21.603
I do. I got one just in case.

449
00:37:21.603 --> 00:37:27.647
There's somewhere I want to go,
but I'm too tired to drive.

450
00:37:27.647 --> 00:37:30.029
You're not driving the bus, are you?

451
00:37:30.663 --> 00:37:32.542
I borrowed a car.

452
00:37:33.197 --> 00:37:37.844
Geez, seriously. Hey, you guys!
Where are my car keys?

453
00:37:37.844 --> 00:37:40.005
So So asked for it so I sent it to her.

454
00:37:40.005 --> 00:37:42.384
Why did you send my car to So So?

455
00:37:43.331 --> 00:37:47.040
- Speak Korean.
- She said you allowed it.

456
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.835
These two are driving me nuts.

457
00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:51.953
The brother threatens
and the sister lies.

458
00:37:54.857 --> 00:37:56.536
What's her area code?

459
00:37:57.717 --> 00:37:59.163
02.

460
00:38:00.147 --> 00:38:03.547
02? Isn't that Seoul? Geez, seriously.

461
00:38:03.547 --> 00:38:07.067
Thank you, Boss. I'll use it well.

462
00:38:07.067 --> 00:38:08.639
<i>So So!</i>

463
00:38:10.527 --> 00:38:12.005
He told me to use it well.

464
00:38:12.005 --> 00:38:14.208
Is there somewhere you want to go?

465
00:38:14.857 --> 00:38:16.788
The place where we first met.

466
00:38:19.677 --> 00:38:21.518
The airport?

467
00:39:04.728 --> 00:39:06.480
Don't do anything useless.

468
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:20.493
Are you done yet?

469
00:40:20.493 --> 00:40:22.268
<i>I'm done. I'm coming out.</i>

470
00:40:22.268 --> 00:40:23.851
Hurry up.

471
00:40:28.464 --> 00:40:30.357
Why did you turn off the lights?

472
00:40:33.828 --> 00:40:35.592
Thanks for dating me.

473
00:40:38.989 --> 00:40:41.779
It's a seventh anniversary room service.

474
00:40:46.804 --> 00:40:48.726
I feel like I'm in France.

475
00:40:49.442 --> 00:40:50.853
Thank you.

476
00:40:56.429 --> 00:40:58.781
I was thankful to you
for the last seven years.

477
00:40:59.589 --> 00:41:02.446
And I'll continue to be thankful.

478
00:41:02.446 --> 00:41:03.759
Me too.

479
00:41:04.726 --> 00:41:07.205
Let's go out and put this on
when we're done.

480
00:41:07.205 --> 00:41:12.060
Was it Pont Neuf? Apparently,
everyone puts these along the bridge.

481
00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.616
Look at this.

482
00:41:23.163 --> 00:41:25.165
I'm not sure about this.

483
00:41:25.165 --> 00:41:27.478
I know where it is. I found the address.

484
00:41:28.612 --> 00:41:30.281
Not that.

485
00:41:31.042 --> 00:41:34.487
Is love something
that should be locked up?

486
00:41:34.487 --> 00:41:35.603
What?

487
00:41:35.603 --> 00:41:38.612
I'm not sure if it's right
to lock up love like that.

488
00:41:38.612 --> 00:41:42.342
Of course we should lock it up.
Let's blow out the candle.

489
00:41:48.147 --> 00:41:49.337
I got it!

490
00:41:52.993 --> 00:41:54.357
It's my investor big brother.

491
00:41:54.877 --> 00:41:57.018
Geez, seriously.

492
00:41:58.112 --> 00:42:00.409
Bonjour, Big Brother.

493
00:42:00.409 --> 00:42:06.134
Yes, of course.
I was waiting for your call.

494
00:42:06.134 --> 00:42:07.397
Yes.

495
00:42:12.337 --> 00:42:13.710
Pardon?

496
00:42:18.094 --> 00:42:19.292
Wait.

497
00:42:27.594 --> 00:42:28.935
Wait a minute.

498
00:42:29.795 --> 00:42:33.835
Big Brother, you said
I passed all the rounds.

499
00:42:33.835 --> 00:42:37.527
I was sure this time,
but our CEO rejected it last minute.

500
00:42:37.527 --> 00:42:41.371
Wait, Big Brother, the thing is...

501
00:42:41.371 --> 00:42:44.469
I was just about to propose.

502
00:42:44.469 --> 00:42:48.286
To tell her everything worked out,
and that we can get married now...

503
00:42:48.286 --> 00:42:49.672
<i>That's that.</i>

504
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:53.540
I'm sure someone else
will tell you when you get back

505
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.308
but do you remember
the 30 million won I lent you?

506
00:42:56.308 --> 00:42:58.645
You invested that money.

507
00:42:58.645 --> 00:43:01.295
I guess there was a misunderstanding.

508
00:43:01.295 --> 00:43:04.344
I lent it to you in the form
of an investment.

509
00:43:04.344 --> 00:43:07.230
Anyway, I need you to pay me back.

510
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.228
<i>I need it.</i>

511
00:44:45.366 --> 00:44:47.295
<i>Are you okay?</i>

512
00:44:47.295 --> 00:44:50.092
Yeah, sorry.

513
00:44:50.092 --> 00:44:52.799
The call lasted awhile.

514
00:44:53.837 --> 00:44:56.154
Can you start eating without me?

515
00:44:56.938 --> 00:45:00.377
I'm fine, so you can come out.

516
00:45:02.107 --> 00:45:05.719
Wait. I need to make another call.

517
00:45:13.478 --> 00:45:17.380
Do you want me to leave?
Do you need some time alone?

518
00:45:24.451 --> 00:45:26.540
<i>I'll go out for a walk.</i>

519
00:47:08.486 --> 00:47:11.983
<i>It's your last day.
Remember to ride the cruise ship.</i>

520
00:47:11.983 --> 00:47:16.253
<i>You know the Seine river cruise
is the best when taken alone, right?</i>

521
00:47:16.253 --> 00:47:19.209
<i>I heard anyone can become
the lead in a movie on that ship.</i>

522
00:48:04.256 --> 00:48:05.666
Are we here?

523
00:48:06.657 --> 00:48:09.285
Is this where we first met?

524
00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:33.729
I said I'm tired.

525
00:48:33.729 --> 00:48:35.539
You're not the boatman.

526
00:48:35.539 --> 00:48:40.488
It's just that... I'm not in a good mood.

527
00:48:40.488 --> 00:48:42.229
I want to rest.

528
00:48:42.229 --> 00:48:43.678
Get on!

529
00:48:57.568 --> 00:49:00.512
People should become
more gentle as they age.

530
00:49:01.111 --> 00:49:03.437
You keep getting more stubborn.

531
00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:08.336
- Are you happy?
- Of course I'm happy.

532
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.003
If we came to France,
we should ride things like this.

533
00:49:12.003 --> 00:49:16.709
I mean, are you happy
that you always win?

534
00:49:17.631 --> 00:49:19.966
I don't win.

535
00:49:19.966 --> 00:49:22.954
You're the one who wins
while pretending to lose.

536
00:49:23.979 --> 00:49:26.557
I wish you'd stop trying to win.

537
00:49:26.557 --> 00:49:28.162
Just enjoy the view.

538
00:49:29.673 --> 00:49:33.213
Wow, we should really set up
a raw fish restaurant here.

539
00:49:39.414 --> 00:49:42.541
I'm going to die soon.

540
00:49:42.541 --> 00:49:45.349
Can't you back down from time to time?

541
00:49:49.477 --> 00:49:51.289
I'm going to die.

542
00:49:54.055 --> 00:49:55.765
I have cancer.

543
00:49:59.526 --> 00:50:01.774
I said I'm dying.

544
00:50:08.588 --> 00:50:10.637
That's nonsense.

545
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:16.370
You're not dying. Who's dying?

546
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:18.146
I knew you'd get mad.

547
00:50:18.146 --> 00:50:20.099
How could I not get mad?

548
00:50:21.566 --> 00:50:24.149
Why did you have to go off
and get cancer?

549
00:50:24.149 --> 00:50:25.461
Why?

550
00:50:26.573 --> 00:50:30.823
You should have told me earlier.
But you threw out your clothes

551
00:50:30.823 --> 00:50:33.517
took a funeral photo,
and cried all by yourself.

552
00:50:33.517 --> 00:50:35.265
You don't deserve to do this!

553
00:50:38.925 --> 00:50:40.753
Did you know all along?

554
00:50:40.753 --> 00:50:43.120
Did you take me for a fool?

555
00:50:44.439 --> 00:50:47.557
Did you treat me like that,
even though you knew?

556
00:50:48.193 --> 00:50:52.370
Then, how should I have treated you?
Did you think I'd carry you everywhere?

557
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:54.863
Yes, I thought you would!

558
00:50:54.863 --> 00:50:57.341
I thought you'd carry me
so I wouldn't get more sick!

559
00:50:57.341 --> 00:51:01.559
Taking care of you with my heart is
enough! I'm not your older brother!

560
00:51:01.559 --> 00:51:04.468
Why would I do that for my wife?

561
00:51:07.186 --> 00:51:11.736
How could you be so shameless?

562
00:51:15.285 --> 00:51:17.686
I said I'm dying.

563
00:51:17.686 --> 00:51:20.782
- Aren't you sad at all?
- Then

564
00:51:20.782 --> 00:51:23.682
should a man walk around sobbing?

565
00:51:23.682 --> 00:51:27.320
Should I go find God and Buddha and pray?

566
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:31.995
The husband is the sky and the wife
is the earth. I need to fulfill my role.

567
00:51:31.995 --> 00:51:34.613
If I cry every day...

568
00:51:37.066 --> 00:51:42.343
If I cry too... you'll feel
too weakhearted to win this battle.

569
00:51:45.356 --> 00:51:47.689
That's why I'm going to
smile more from now on.

570
00:51:56.606 --> 00:51:58.077
I...

571
00:52:01.075 --> 00:52:03.948
want you to smile one more time.

572
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.841
I don't want you to be sick.

573
00:52:09.925 --> 00:52:12.452
What am I supposed to do?

574
00:52:22.108 --> 00:52:24.959
I learned that men
aren't supposed to cry.

575
00:52:26.566 --> 00:52:31.562
I lived my whole life... like a fool.

576
00:52:32.794 --> 00:52:36.225
What am I supposed to do now?

577
00:52:41.677 --> 00:52:43.555
If you leave me...

578
00:52:45.175 --> 00:52:47.773
what am I supposed to do?

579
00:53:01.446 --> 00:53:03.421
You learned well.

580
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:07.847
Who taught you such a thing?

581
00:53:13.039 --> 00:53:14.432
Stop it.

582
00:53:21.593 --> 00:53:23.372
Stop it already.

583
00:53:29.327 --> 00:53:31.153
I was wrong.

584
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:33.713
Honey.

585
00:53:42.863 --> 00:53:44.365
Goodness.

586
00:53:45.017 --> 00:53:47.108
I told you to stop.

587
00:53:57.854 --> 00:54:00.506
Don't be sick.

588
00:54:06.608 --> 00:54:08.119
Okay.

589
00:54:09.584 --> 00:54:11.646
I won't be sick.

590
00:54:11.646 --> 00:54:15.571
That's right!
That's right. Don't be sick.

591
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:31.778
<i>Honey, don't be sick.</i>

592
00:54:31.778 --> 00:54:36.222
<i>Let's live happily,
for a long, long time.</i>

593
00:54:37.709 --> 00:54:40.887
<i>I want to see
your healthy face every day.</i>

594
00:54:40.887 --> 00:54:45.434
<i>I wish that only happy days remain.</i>

595
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:25.236
It's right here.
This is where we first met.

596
00:55:27.191 --> 00:55:29.390
We were here on the third day.

597
00:55:29.939 --> 00:55:34.240
I was told that I was fated
to meet my true love here.

598
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.367
They said he'd take me
to an angel's feet.

599
00:55:40.244 --> 00:55:42.881
I thought it was nonsense.

600
00:55:43.494 --> 00:55:48.211
But... I met that person.

601
00:55:49.629 --> 00:55:51.102
Who was it?

602
00:55:53.093 --> 00:55:54.602
You.

603
00:55:59.383 --> 00:56:02.916
Am I... your fated love?

604
00:56:04.042 --> 00:56:05.820
I think so.

605
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.334
You don't believe in fate, though.

606
00:56:09.588 --> 00:56:11.537
I'm going to believe in it now.

607
00:56:12.767 --> 00:56:13.773
Then...

608
00:56:13.773 --> 00:56:17.611
We might have been two people
who had to meet.

609
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:19.367
That's why...

610
00:56:23.144 --> 00:56:27.367
we'll be able to meet again,
even if we break up.

611
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:30.573
Are we breaking up?

612
00:56:35.919 --> 00:56:40.898
I felt like I was
your girlfriend all day long.

613
00:56:41.986 --> 00:56:46.506
I was so happy that I wanted to
go back to Korea with you.

614
00:56:46.506 --> 00:56:51.256
I didn't know it felt so good
to feel the power of fate.

615
00:56:51.256 --> 00:56:56.517
But... there is something
that is more important than fate.

616
00:56:59.057 --> 00:57:00.519
Me.

617
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:04.983
I still need to love myself more.

618
00:57:06.046 --> 00:57:10.122
If I can't love myself,
I'm going to try to fill that void

619
00:57:10.122 --> 00:57:12.762
with someone else's love.

620
00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:17.144
"Pay more attention to me.
Love me a little more."

621
00:57:17.825 --> 00:57:20.856
I'll end up hiding behind love...

622
00:57:22.894 --> 00:57:25.053
without being able to do anything.

623
00:57:27.256 --> 00:57:31.769
So So, do you remember when I
told you that you're a cool woman?

624
00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:36.780
But you're acting foolish.

625
00:57:37.595 --> 00:57:39.648
What are you so scared of?

626
00:57:41.638 --> 00:57:43.562
Being in love.

627
00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:47.651
I'm afraid this love will hurt too.

628
00:57:49.816 --> 00:57:51.856
That's not true. It won't.

629
00:57:51.856 --> 00:57:55.497
I'll call you often, and visit you
in France when I can.

630
00:57:59.019 --> 00:58:00.820
Don't call me.

631
00:58:01.874 --> 00:58:03.785
It'll start with a call every day

632
00:58:03.785 --> 00:58:05.744
but then it'll be once a week,
once a month.

633
00:58:05.744 --> 00:58:07.965
I don't want it to fade out...

634
00:58:08.684 --> 00:58:10.334
like that.

635
00:58:14.807 --> 00:58:18.914
Then... are we breaking up now?

636
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:39.097
If we... happen to really meet,
as if it were fate

637
00:58:39.097 --> 00:58:42.236
then... then...

638
00:58:42.809 --> 00:58:45.718
I won't be scared anymore.

639
00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:57.084
Please say something.

640
00:59:00.528 --> 00:59:02.151
Don't erase my pictures.

641
00:59:08.724 --> 00:59:10.398
Okay, then.

642
00:59:36.461 --> 00:59:43.461
