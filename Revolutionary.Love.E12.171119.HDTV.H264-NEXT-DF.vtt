<i>[Episode 12]</i>

3
00:00:32.684 --> 00:00:34.635
What is this?

4
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:39.224
Hyuk has been being entertained
by our collaborating companies.

5
00:00:39.224 --> 00:00:42.686
Why would a mere intern
be wined and dined?

6
00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:46.873
The companies we work with wouldn't
see him as a mere intern.

7
00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:48.656
They would see him as your son, Father.

8
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.894
It seems he's been requesting a lot.

9
00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:55.778
I've been getting many anonymous tips.

10
00:00:55.778 --> 00:00:57.979
Gosh, Gang Su.

11
00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.550
You should've given him a decent salary.

12
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.381
He could spend
tens of millions of won a day.

13
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:04.804
How can live off
an intern's salary of 1.5 million won?

14
00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:06.497
That rascal.

15
00:01:06.497 --> 00:01:10.516
Why didn't he come to me
if he needed money?

16
00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:12.256
He's up to all sorts of things lately.

17
00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:14.327
This shouldn't be taken lightly, Father.

18
00:01:14.327 --> 00:01:18.676
Things that were seen as traditional
in the past are now problems.

19
00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:22.134
What about the beef rice bowls?

20
00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:24.708
You don't think he gained favor
for them through bribes, do you?

21
00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:25.873
Oh my!

22
00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:29.557
Will you lose the president's
commendation if that's true?

23
00:01:29.557 --> 00:01:33.048
Oh, they might tell you to return it!

24
00:01:33.048 --> 00:01:35.301
For goodness' sake.

25
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:37.488
You out there. Secretary Park!

26
00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:40.385
Yes, CEO.

27
00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:42.534
- Tell Hyuk to come up.
- Yes, CEO.

28
00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:52.056
Huh?

29
00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:55.527
You should've been smarter about it
if you were going to accept them.

30
00:01:55.527 --> 00:01:58.408
Why would you leave behind evidence?

31
00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:00.810
This... this really is total nonsense!

32
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.030
This isn't true.

33
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.840
I went along because I was told
the meeting was for work.

34
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.479
I never accepted money.
Please trust me, Father!

35
00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.578
It's okay.

36
00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:10.507
When you work in a company...

37
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:14.556
things like this can happen.

38
00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:18.820
But, people have started sending
each other anonymous tips.

39
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.312
You had that airplane scandal
not too long ago.

40
00:02:22.312 --> 00:02:24.791
Imagine if this leaks out too!

41
00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:28.580
Restoring you will be impossible then.

42
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.850
Just leave for a bit.

43
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.189
Or until things quiet down, just go...

44
00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.701
stay quiet somewhere.

45
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:39.763
Why should I? This isn't true, Father.

46
00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:41.693
Stop making excuses.

47
00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:45.733
You should be thankful for our
father's generous decision.

48
00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:56.741
Father, I'd rather you did
an official investigation.

49
00:02:56.741 --> 00:03:00.086
After the investigation,
if it is revealed that I took the bribe

50
00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:02.848
then I will happily
accept any punishment.

51
00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:05.293
However, I really did not do it.

52
00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:07.259
I have been framed this time.

53
00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:10.961
- Framed?
- Yes, Father.

54
00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:16.337
I don't know who
or why they framed me.

55
00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:18.226
I must found out and reveal them.

56
00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.227
Then bring me evidence.

57
00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:25.016
Bring me irrefutable evidence
that you've been framed.

58
00:03:25.016 --> 00:03:26.087
Father.

59
00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:30.531
I'll give you exactly three days.

60
00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:34.761
If you can't bring me evidence by then,
you're out of the company.

61
00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:36.392
Do you understand?

62
00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:37.697
I understand.

63
00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:47.546
What? A bribe?

64
00:03:48.774 --> 00:03:50.446
Are you doing that kind of thing now?

65
00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.332
I didn't do it though.
I didn't take a bribe.

66
00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:55.304
I've really been wronged.

67
00:03:55.304 --> 00:03:58.212
You said there was a picture of you
taking an envelope though.

68
00:03:58.212 --> 00:04:00.660
That's why I'm going crazy here, Joon.

69
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.850
Who in the world took
that picture and why am I in it?

70
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.731
My father wants me to prove I've
been framed within three days.

71
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.000
What do I do, Joon?

72
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.422
What do I do, Jae Hoon?

73
00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:14.804
Where did the picture come from?

74
00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:17.771
I don't know. I'm the only one in it.

75
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:19.340
The other company person isn't in it.

76
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.321
Still, there must one
or two people you can think of.

77
00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:27.912
Perhaps...

78
00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:31.122
it's CEO Min.

79
00:04:31.122 --> 00:04:33.073
- CEO Min?
- CEO Min?

80
00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.352
Yes.

81
00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:36.622
He's the CEO of the company.

82
00:04:36.622 --> 00:04:41.044
Yes, turns out he owns a food product, a
food container, and a packaging company.

83
00:04:41.044 --> 00:04:44.453
All three are owned by CEO Min.

84
00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:46.413
Was Section Chief Yang there with you?

85
00:04:46.413 --> 00:04:48.143
Of course!

86
00:04:48.143 --> 00:04:51.273
Section Chief Yang
took all the envelopes.

87
00:04:51.273 --> 00:04:54.119
I need see the pictures. Where are they?

88
00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:55.740
My father has them.

89
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.420
Ah, really?

90
00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:02.482
Okay, I'll look into
the pictures somehow.

91
00:05:02.482 --> 00:05:04.670
Get Section Chief Yang
to make a statement for you.

92
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.011
As if Section Chief Yang
would make such a statement.

93
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:10.261
He should try though,
especially against CEO Min.

94
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:12.862
He can't take it lying down, right Hyuk?

95
00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:16.412
Of course! I'll go meet
Section Chief Yang.

96
00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:18.081
Okay. Let's go!

97
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:20.396
Go!

98
00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:53.518
I just need to talk for a moment.

99
00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:54.746
Why? What is it?

100
00:05:54.746 --> 00:05:57.855
You know that time we were
drinking with CEO Min?

101
00:05:57.855 --> 00:06:00.665
I didn't take
any envelopes from him, did I?

102
00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:03.424
Envelopes? Why would you mention that?

103
00:06:03.424 --> 00:06:06.978
You took an envelope
from him and I didn't.

104
00:06:06.978 --> 00:06:10.030
Can you go see the CEO and
make that statement for me?

105
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.357
What are you talking about?
You're crazy.

106
00:06:13.357 --> 00:06:14.891
Section Chief Yang!

107
00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:17.682
The envelope... the envelope!

108
00:07:05.634 --> 00:07:07.386
<i>[To: Baek Joon]</i>

109
00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:12.054
<i>[Have secured the pictures.]</i>

110
00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.651
Section Chief Yang, Section Chief Yang!

111
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:20.912
I was totally drunk that day and
I don't remember a thing.

112
00:07:20.912 --> 00:07:25.124
Section Chief Yang!
You accepted that envelope.

113
00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:26.884
Hey, you'd better be quiet.

114
00:07:26.884 --> 00:07:30.410
If you bring this up once more,
I won't let it go.

115
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.081
I'll go to the CEO and tell him
you took an envelope full of money too.

116
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:38.422
- What?
- Just stop bothering me.

117
00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:40.768
Seriously, Section Chief Yang!

118
00:07:55.672 --> 00:07:57.453
<i>[Mister Lee]</i>

119
00:07:57.453 --> 00:08:00.062
<i>[Have secured the pictures.]</i>

120
00:08:01.752 --> 00:08:03.422
Okay, then.

121
00:08:05.658 --> 00:08:07.110
Oh, you scared me.

122
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:09.790
What are you doing here?

123
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.336
Don't get involved in this.

124
00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:15.317
If I don't, should I leave Hyuk
to get wronged like this?

125
00:08:15.317 --> 00:08:17.220
Hyuk might really have taken the money.

126
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.633
Hyuk says he didn't.

127
00:08:18.633 --> 00:08:20.833
How can you trust him?

128
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.074
You don't believe him?

129
00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:27.814
He's going up against CEO Min.

130
00:08:27.814 --> 00:08:30.948
You and I both know
who's backing CEO Min.

131
00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:32.916
Isn't the picture obvious to you?

132
00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:35.295
Yes, you're right.

133
00:08:35.295 --> 00:08:37.025
This is Hyuk's family's fight.

134
00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:39.627
This a fight between
Hyuk and his brother.

135
00:08:39.627 --> 00:08:42.832
But, he's fighting
very dirty for a family fight.

136
00:08:42.832 --> 00:08:44.900
He's even framing him
for a bribe Hyuk didn't take.

137
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.060
Nonetheless, just ignore it.

138
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.651
- We shouldn't get involved this time.
- No.

139
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:52.930
Hyuk didn't just stand by and watch.

140
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:58.115
When I went to President Jang to find out
the truth about my dad's bribery case...

141
00:08:58.115 --> 00:09:00.271
I only heard the truth thanks to Hyuk.

142
00:09:01.378 --> 00:09:02.939
So, how can I do nothing?

143
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:10.519
We are Hyuk's friends, Jae Hoon.

144
00:09:12.583 --> 00:09:13.647
Aren't we?

145
00:09:14.757 --> 00:09:17.250
<i>What is this picture you want to draw?</i>

146
00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:19.867
A world where you can win.

147
00:09:25.237 --> 00:09:29.155
A place where my friends,
like Joon, can win.

148
00:09:36.665 --> 00:09:38.974
What? CEO Min?

149
00:09:38.974 --> 00:09:40.053
Yes, CEO Min.

150
00:09:40.053 --> 00:09:43.125
CEO Min has that many companies?

151
00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:44.145
Turns out he does.

152
00:09:44.145 --> 00:09:48.585
Section Chief Yang's proposals this time
all include CEO Min's companies.

153
00:09:48.585 --> 00:09:51.536
Oh my goodness, my goodness!

154
00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:05.622
Ah, here it is.

155
00:10:05.622 --> 00:10:07.770
The names of all of CEO Min's companies.

156
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.266
<i>[Hangang Food Products,
Hangang Containers, Hangang Packaging]</i>

157
00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:13.444
Something smells off about this.

158
00:10:13.444 --> 00:10:14.731
What smell?

159
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:17.256
Look, food products,
containers, and packaging.

160
00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:21.131
All of these are connected to each other,
so why make separate companies?

161
00:10:21.131 --> 00:10:24.294
The CEO is one person.
Right, Ki Sub?

162
00:10:24.294 --> 00:10:25.852
It can't be...

163
00:10:27.462 --> 00:10:30.050
No way. It can't be.

164
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.141
What? What is it?

165
00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:35.021
No, I'll look into it some more.

166
00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:37.606
I'll tell you once I'm sure.

167
00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:41.330
I am an expert in the equity structure
of complicated companies.

168
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.767
I'll figure it out
and let you know, okay?

169
00:10:43.767 --> 00:10:45.181
Yes, okay.

170
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:50.640
Then I'll look into what contracts those
companies have with Gangsu Foods.

171
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.758
What's going on with the pictures?

172
00:10:52.758 --> 00:10:55.337
Joon agreed to look into the pictures.

173
00:10:56.925 --> 00:10:58.688
- Eat up.
- All right.

174
00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:01.291
Wow.

175
00:11:02.486 --> 00:11:04.695
Yum. This is good.

176
00:11:18.397 --> 00:11:21.045
Do you remember him, Sis?

177
00:11:25.478 --> 00:11:26.556
Yeah.

178
00:11:26.556 --> 00:11:29.137
I heard CEO Min was there too.

179
00:11:29.137 --> 00:11:31.876
You were there too, right?

180
00:11:31.876 --> 00:11:34.578
I don't know. Maybe, I was.

181
00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:40.107
Did this person here
really take that money?

182
00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:44.529
I don't know. I can't really remember.

183
00:11:44.529 --> 00:11:46.647
Did he take it or not...

184
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:52.569
Sis! Please just tell me.

185
00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:54.781
Did he really take the money?

186
00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:56.579
Is this picture correct?

187
00:11:56.579 --> 00:11:58.660
I have nothing to say.
You should leave, Joon.

188
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.809
It's very important to this person.

189
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:06.016
Can't you please tell me?

190
00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:09.133
Let me ask you something first.
Why are you doing this?

191
00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:11.161
I told you that it's important to him.

192
00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:14.381
It's not because he's important to you?

193
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:16.622
If he's not that kind
of person to you, then leave.

194
00:12:16.622 --> 00:12:19.810
Don't go through the trouble.

195
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.275
He is...

196
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:27.760
important to me.

197
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.050
How important is he?

198
00:12:35.953 --> 00:12:37.084
Very.

199
00:12:38.743 --> 00:12:40.132
Very, very important.

200
00:12:42.803 --> 00:12:46.892
So, please think of our history.

201
00:12:46.892 --> 00:12:48.615
Can't you help me this once?

202
00:12:51.483 --> 00:12:52.793
I'm asking you to help.

203
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:57.742
What will you do about Hyuk, Father?

204
00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:05.193
You will send him out if he can't bring
evidence within three days, right?

205
00:13:05.193 --> 00:13:07.652
Do you not know
your younger brother at all?

206
00:13:07.652 --> 00:13:09.343
What do you mean by that?

207
00:13:09.343 --> 00:13:13.282
He usually gives up on everything.

208
00:13:13.282 --> 00:13:16.242
He may not admit
to other people's wrongs.

209
00:13:16.242 --> 00:13:18.915
He is the type to avoid things.

210
00:13:18.915 --> 00:13:20.333
Isn't that right, Woo Sung?

211
00:13:24.532 --> 00:13:28.102
He went to study abroad like that
and had many chances to run.

212
00:13:28.102 --> 00:13:30.061
Right now, he's holding firm though.

213
00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:32.883
That means there's a reason why.

214
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.762
Why don't you consider believing
your brother at all?

215
00:13:42.972 --> 00:13:46.041
I do believe that Hyuk is innocent.

216
00:13:46.041 --> 00:13:49.713
Shouldn't we keep our personal
and business lives separate though?

217
00:13:49.713 --> 00:13:53.103
This is not a small matter. It's bribery.

218
00:13:53.103 --> 00:13:55.311
What? Bribery?

219
00:13:55.311 --> 00:13:57.631
Who? Hyuk?

220
00:13:57.631 --> 00:14:00.309
He says he was framed.
He's going to prove it.

221
00:14:00.309 --> 00:14:02.910
Let's wait and see, okay?

222
00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:13.251
What is this all about?

223
00:14:13.251 --> 00:14:17.121
What is this about bribery and
about proving his innocence?

224
00:14:18.463 --> 00:14:22.473
Did something happen to Hyuk again?

225
00:14:22.473 --> 00:14:24.319
Honey.

226
00:14:24.319 --> 00:14:27.599
If you had choose between Woo Sung
and Hyuk, who would you choose?

227
00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:30.510
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.968
I suppose I should choose the one
who's left standing in the end.

229
00:14:34.968 --> 00:14:36.762
He will be the stronger one.

230
00:14:36.762 --> 00:14:40.377
They are both my children and
they both need to live well.

231
00:14:40.377 --> 00:14:43.645
You want to see one die
just to raise one strong one?

232
00:14:43.645 --> 00:14:47.093
Are you determined to cast one out?

233
00:14:47.093 --> 00:14:49.473
Is that what you're doing?

234
00:14:49.473 --> 00:14:53.314
When it comes to company management,
the strong one would be best.

235
00:14:53.314 --> 00:14:57.574
How can you be a father and not even
consider the happiness of your kids?

236
00:14:57.574 --> 00:15:00.284
All you talk about is your
company, company, company!

237
00:15:01.457 --> 00:15:04.505
Come on, you're being too harsh.

238
00:15:04.505 --> 00:15:05.665
That's enough.

239
00:15:06.636 --> 00:15:10.684
Do you know how much I've regretted
not righting that wrong back then?

240
00:15:11.575 --> 00:15:13.597
Well, why would you know?

241
00:15:13.597 --> 00:15:15.734
You have no interest at all.

242
00:15:17.106 --> 00:15:19.228
Where are you going?

243
00:15:19.228 --> 00:15:20.236
Hey.

244
00:15:21.669 --> 00:15:22.786
Honey.

245
00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:26.815
Where are you going this late at night?

246
00:15:26.815 --> 00:15:30.698
I've lost all affection for you.
I don't want to be near you.

247
00:15:30.698 --> 00:15:33.987
Wait. Honey. Honey!

248
00:15:33.987 --> 00:15:35.237
My goodness.

249
00:15:47.626 --> 00:15:49.325
<i>[Madam Baek]</i>

250
00:15:50.483 --> 00:15:51.743
<i>[Baek Joon]</i>

251
00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.242
<i>Come for drinks at the street vendor.</i>

252
00:16:04.758 --> 00:16:07.274
I'll be going now.

253
00:16:07.274 --> 00:16:08.968
Can't you see everyone's working late?

254
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.847
I'm done with all of my work.

255
00:16:10.847 --> 00:16:12.127
Work hard.

256
00:16:13.737 --> 00:16:17.770
Third Generation sure has
a free office life.

257
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.695
I'm going to get going as well.

258
00:16:23.673 --> 00:16:24.868
What's going on?

259
00:16:27.368 --> 00:16:29.069
What?

260
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:31.279
The employees on this team are a mess!

261
00:16:38.988 --> 00:16:40.303
Over here.

262
00:16:46.054 --> 00:16:47.522
What happened?

263
00:16:47.522 --> 00:16:49.409
Did you find out
the source of the picture?

264
00:16:49.409 --> 00:16:51.569
Who am I? Of course, I did.

265
00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:55.436
It's not a picture. It's a video.

266
00:16:55.436 --> 00:16:57.040
A video?

267
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.695
It's not a hidden camera, is it?

268
00:16:58.695 --> 00:16:59.876
A hidden camera?

269
00:17:08.955 --> 00:17:12.557
Hidden camera? This is a hidden camera?

270
00:17:12.557 --> 00:17:15.301
Yes, it was filmed with that.

271
00:17:18.192 --> 00:17:20.057
Where is the original file?

272
00:17:20.057 --> 00:17:22.470
CEO Min took it long ago.

273
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.905
There's nothing here.

274
00:17:25.905 --> 00:17:30.215
Joon, I'm saying this
because I care about you.

275
00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:32.445
Don't get involved so recklessly.

276
00:17:32.445 --> 00:17:34.316
Byun Woo Sung is a scary person.

277
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.316
Chief Byun Woo Sung?

278
00:17:37.316 --> 00:17:41.732
Chief Byun Woo Sung
probably has that video now.

279
00:17:44.846 --> 00:17:46.715
What? My brother?

280
00:17:46.715 --> 00:17:49.945
Yes, she says your brother
probably has it.

281
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:53.004
CEO Min does whatever
Byun Woo Sung tells him to do.

282
00:17:57.465 --> 00:17:58.946
Are you okay, Hyuk?

283
00:17:58.946 --> 00:18:00.636
Wow, what is this?

284
00:18:01.936 --> 00:18:05.575
Is this the "War of the Brothers"
that I've only heard about?

285
00:18:05.575 --> 00:18:07.376
It's not a war yet.

286
00:18:07.376 --> 00:18:09.827
You haven't officially
pulled out your sword yet.

287
00:18:10.898 --> 00:18:12.485
Where are you going?

288
00:18:12.485 --> 00:18:14.098
To meet CEO Min.

289
00:18:14.098 --> 00:18:17.428
I need to see for myself,
to see if my brother ordered all of this.

290
00:18:17.428 --> 00:18:20.944
If you do ask him,
do you think he'll just confess?

291
00:18:20.944 --> 00:18:23.665
Suppose that he does,
do you think that's evidence?

292
00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:25.165
I'll have to record him.

293
00:18:25.165 --> 00:18:29.521
Going to him to bring up your brother
is rash and it's like suicide, okay?

294
00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:31.985
Yeah, Jae Hoon is right.

295
00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:35.936
Once you bring up your brother,
it doesn't help us get evidence.

296
00:18:43.007 --> 00:18:44.555
Then what should I do now?

297
00:18:44.555 --> 00:18:49.793
First, we need to get
the video that Chief Byun has.

298
00:18:49.793 --> 00:18:51.615
We don't even know where it is.

299
00:18:51.615 --> 00:18:54.145
Hello... Kitty.

300
00:18:55.915 --> 00:18:58.395
- Hello Kitty?
- Hello Kitty?

301
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.559
Hello Kitty?

302
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:08.038
Yes, it's on the Hello Kitty USB
that CEO Min took.

303
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.248
Hello Kitty, you say.

304
00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:24.519
<i>It's a sign of my sincerity.</i>

305
00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:26.724
<i>It's all part of the affection
that's between us.</i>

306
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.743
Please don't refuse. Just accept it.

307
00:19:44.743 --> 00:19:46.970
It's all part of the affection
that's between us.

308
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.264
CEO, don't do this.
I won't take this.

309
00:19:50.264 --> 00:19:53.595
If you keep doing this,
I'll be very hurt.

310
00:19:53.595 --> 00:19:55.657
If you keep doing this,
I'm going to leave.

311
00:19:55.657 --> 00:19:59.395
All right, all right.
Then just have another drink.

312
00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:00.555
Here.

313
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.311
Here you go.

314
00:20:24.136 --> 00:20:26.395
Is this the only copy of the video?

315
00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:28.716
- Are you sure?
- I am certain.

316
00:20:28.716 --> 00:20:31.416
Keep your people quiet.

317
00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:33.466
Be careful, so nothing leaks.

318
00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:34.758
Yes, I understand.

319
00:20:38.629 --> 00:20:40.484
<i>If you keep doing this,
I'm going to leave.</i>

320
00:20:40.484 --> 00:20:41.805
<i>All right.</i>

321
00:21:38.713 --> 00:21:39.983
Wait.

322
00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:56.562
<i>Oh, that lethal agility.</i>

323
00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:58.526
<i>That luxurious, voluptuous beauty.</i>

324
00:23:30.129 --> 00:23:32.603
Hello, kitty.

325
00:23:32.603 --> 00:23:34.422
Yes, Joon.

326
00:23:34.422 --> 00:23:38.192
My love, my love, mi amor.

327
00:23:38.192 --> 00:23:42.595
Mi amor, mi amor.

328
00:23:44.212 --> 00:23:50.932
Mi amor, mi amor, mi amor, mi amor...

329
00:23:50.932 --> 00:23:52.254
What are you doing?

330
00:23:54.784 --> 00:23:58.965
I guess getting it like that isn't
going to work, right?

331
00:23:58.965 --> 00:24:00.547
Of course not.

332
00:24:00.547 --> 00:24:04.765
You could get charged
with breaking and entering.

333
00:24:04.765 --> 00:24:07.835
Do you want to be interrogated
by prosecutors again?

334
00:24:07.835 --> 00:24:10.406
No, I don't want that, friend.

335
00:24:10.406 --> 00:24:13.556
Should I pretend to clean to look for it?

336
00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:17.451
If you get caught on the CCTV,
it could be a problem later.

337
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:20.036
Then what can we do?

338
00:24:20.036 --> 00:24:25.257
Ah, who can go into Chief Byun's
office without looking suspicious?

339
00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:28.474
Without looking suspicious,
go inside and...

340
00:24:28.474 --> 00:24:34.200
the person who
could take the video is...

341
00:24:40.037 --> 00:24:42.954
Are you crazy? I'm not doing that.

342
00:24:42.954 --> 00:24:44.505
Dream on.

343
00:24:44.505 --> 00:24:46.994
Hey, how can you just leave like this?

344
00:24:50.397 --> 00:24:52.868
It could be too much
for Jae Hoon, right?

345
00:24:52.868 --> 00:24:54.190
Don't be disappointed.

346
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.510
We still have time,
so let's think of a way.

347
00:25:00.638 --> 00:25:02.488
Whatever happens, Joon...

348
00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:07.539
I'm so thankful that
you're worrying about me this much.

349
00:25:12.183 --> 00:25:15.118
You don't need to hold my hand though.

350
00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:18.155
Okay.

351
00:25:19.253 --> 00:25:20.665
We'll find a way, right?

352
00:25:34.231 --> 00:25:35.274
Excuse me.

353
00:25:38.407 --> 00:25:40.978
What did you mean earlier?

354
00:25:40.978 --> 00:25:42.073
What do you mean?

355
00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:46.788
Why did you tell me
you transferred to Financial Crimes?

356
00:25:46.788 --> 00:25:50.510
Just... think whatever you'd like.

357
00:25:51.647 --> 00:25:52.749
Oh yeah.

358
00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:56.744
Do you know a company called BS?

359
00:26:00.087 --> 00:26:01.166
You don't know?

360
00:26:04.175 --> 00:26:06.797
Never mind if you don't know.

361
00:26:06.797 --> 00:26:07.873
Look here.

362
00:26:09.684 --> 00:26:13.312
Do you know that
you're getting on my nerves?

363
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.970
I don't particularly like you either.

364
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.569
Are you starting something with me?

365
00:26:20.569 --> 00:26:22.094
I'm just talking to you.

366
00:26:23.078 --> 00:26:24.078
Bye.

367
00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:32.253
What's going on with you two?

368
00:26:32.253 --> 00:26:34.825
Did something happen between you two?

369
00:26:45.277 --> 00:26:46.633
What was that?

370
00:26:46.633 --> 00:26:55.084
They're not getting mad at each
other over me, are they?

371
00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:57.540
I don't want them fighting over me.

372
00:26:59.629 --> 00:27:01.226
What? Who's fighting?

373
00:27:01.226 --> 00:27:02.659
Oh, you scared me.

374
00:27:04.446 --> 00:27:06.475
Did you just get in?

375
00:27:06.475 --> 00:27:09.106
Yes, was someone fighting?

376
00:27:09.106 --> 00:27:11.579
No, it's just Jae Hoon.

377
00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:13.728
- What about Jae Hoon?
- What about Jae Hoon?

378
00:27:13.728 --> 00:27:18.815
He keeps butting heads with
my neighbor because of me.

379
00:27:18.815 --> 00:27:22.713
I'm worried that they'll
end up in a fight.

380
00:27:22.713 --> 00:27:24.591
I'm a little nervous.

381
00:27:24.591 --> 00:27:26.624
I really am okay.

382
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.869
What is this all about, Joon?
Why would Jae Hoon do that?

383
00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:36.110
You don't need to know.
Just go to bed.

384
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.201
Come on. Why would Jae Hoon do that?

385
00:27:40.161 --> 00:27:41.380
Actually...

386
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:46.521
I guess Yeon Hee likes Jae Hoon.

387
00:27:47.841 --> 00:27:52.090
Oh? Really?

388
00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.139
Oh! Oh!

389
00:28:10.357 --> 00:28:12.327
Oh, it's cold.

390
00:28:15.607 --> 00:28:16.818
Joon.

391
00:28:16.818 --> 00:28:18.155
Hyuk's mother.

392
00:28:21.325 --> 00:28:22.645
Hello.

393
00:28:22.645 --> 00:28:24.152
So cold, so cold.

394
00:28:24.152 --> 00:28:26.211
Let's go inside.

395
00:28:26.211 --> 00:28:28.409
Come on inside.

396
00:28:28.409 --> 00:28:31.139
Oh, I almost froze to death.

397
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.933
I left my boiler off.
It should get warm soon.

398
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:42.950
What brings you by today?

399
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:49.349
Well, is it okay if I sleep here tonight?

400
00:28:49.349 --> 00:28:50.830
What?

401
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.839
Actually, I left my home.

402
00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:56.319
It's a secret from Hyuk.

403
00:28:56.319 --> 00:28:57.741
Ah, okay.

404
00:28:59.348 --> 00:29:02.830
But, it'll be uncomfortable
sleeping here.

405
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.251
No, it's fine.
I'm not uncomfortable at all.

406
00:29:06.251 --> 00:29:08.387
Are you uncomfortable?

407
00:29:08.387 --> 00:29:09.472
Yes.

408
00:29:11.238 --> 00:29:14.127
I think I will be a bit uncomfortable.

409
00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:15.690
Oh my.

410
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:20.178
How could you be so honest to my face?

411
00:29:20.178 --> 00:29:23.934
You really are my kind of person
the more I see you, Joon.

412
00:29:23.934 --> 00:29:27.307
A person who is blunt and honest
like you, is just my type of person.

413
00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:30.200
I was just like you when I was younger.

414
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.731
I may look this way,
but I'm part of the protest generation.

415
00:29:33.731 --> 00:29:36.289
I've even thrown rocks.

416
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:40.345
I see.

417
00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:44.764
It was my dream to move out and
live in a place like this in college.

418
00:29:44.764 --> 00:29:47.778
Oh no. Rooftop rooms
can be bad in some ways.

419
00:29:47.778 --> 00:29:48.959
There are cockroaches.

420
00:29:48.959 --> 00:29:50.927
Oh my, oh my!

421
00:29:57.319 --> 00:29:59.489
Should I bring you some clothes?

422
00:29:59.489 --> 00:30:01.088
Yes, I'd like that.

423
00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:06.332
Hey, can you bring me
some socks for sleeping too?

424
00:30:06.332 --> 00:30:08.438
Sure, sleeping socks.

425
00:30:16.075 --> 00:30:17.944
Hey, Joon.

426
00:30:17.944 --> 00:30:20.532
Look on my Hyuk favorably.

427
00:30:20.532 --> 00:30:22.453
Hyuk likes you so much.

428
00:30:27.906 --> 00:30:29.770
Here you go.

429
00:30:31.219 --> 00:30:36.338
I won't ever be a bothersome
mother-in-law if you two marry.

430
00:30:36.338 --> 00:30:39.879
Marry?

431
00:30:39.879 --> 00:30:44.128
Yes, I would be
a really cool mother-in-law.

432
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:51.378
By any chance, do you have any
lukewarm water for drinking?

433
00:30:51.378 --> 00:30:53.271
Yes, I do.

434
00:30:53.271 --> 00:30:55.009
I'll... I'll bring you some.

435
00:31:06.817 --> 00:31:08.927
No, no.

436
00:31:08.927 --> 00:31:12.868
You have to have half cold and
half hot to make lukewarm water.

437
00:31:12.868 --> 00:31:15.128
- You know how, right?
- Yes.

438
00:31:15.128 --> 00:31:17.211
Half cold and half hot.

439
00:31:17.211 --> 00:31:19.014
I understand.

440
00:31:22.904 --> 00:31:24.873
I want to reiterate it once more.

441
00:31:24.873 --> 00:31:27.503
I'm not the kind of mother-in-law

442
00:31:27.503 --> 00:31:30.135
who will order you around
and tell you what to do.

443
00:31:30.135 --> 00:31:31.732
You'll know once you see.

444
00:31:33.015 --> 00:31:34.147
Yes.

What is it?
Do you have something to say?

447
00:31:56.433 --> 00:32:00.078
No, but is there someone
you like by any chance?

448
00:32:01.966 --> 00:32:03.459
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

449
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.981
I just don't think
I can remember you dating a girl.

450
00:32:07.981 --> 00:32:10.739
Be quiet. Go to bed
if you have nothing to do.

451
00:32:17.209 --> 00:32:18.608
Do you know what?

452
00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:23.417
I really want you to be truly happy.

00:32:23.417 --> 00:32:25.957
You are my one and only friend.

454

If you can't prove that you're
innocent of bribery...

455
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.604
what will happen to you?

456
00:32:37.604 --> 00:32:39.844
I'll probably get kicked out
of the company.

457
00:32:39.844 --> 00:32:42.071
That won't happen though.

458
00:32:42.071 --> 00:32:45.332
I will end up getting that video.

459
00:32:47.973 --> 00:32:49.354
Oh, I'm so tired.

460
00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.842
- Hyuk.
- I'm so tired.

461
00:32:54.844 --> 00:32:56.780
- Sleep in your spot.
- Okay.

Did you hear about what happened

They're talking about bribery

- I left home last night.
- What?

486
00:35:48.867 --> 00:35:54.718
I just don't think my mind suits
your father's any longer.

487
00:35:54.718 --> 00:35:59.031
The gap grows larger the older he gets
and it's a big problem.

488
00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:01.919
Still, you should resolve
family issues in the home.

489
00:36:01.919 --> 00:36:05.499
This is the company.
You shouldn't do this here.

490
00:36:05.499 --> 00:36:09.997
Your mom left home.
How could you not express any worry?

491
00:36:09.997 --> 00:36:12.209
You're just going
to cut me off like this?

492
00:36:12.209 --> 00:36:14.638
I have a meeting here
with the marketing team soon.

493
00:36:15.968 --> 00:36:19.738
Goodness, they do say
raising sons is useless.

494
00:36:19.738 --> 00:36:23.249
You haven't even asked me
if I had breakfast yet!

495
00:36:24.249 --> 00:36:25.678
Have you had breakfast?

496
00:36:25.678 --> 00:36:28.127
Of course, I haven't.

497
00:36:28.127 --> 00:36:31.892
Is there a place nearby to have brunch?

498
00:36:33.182 --> 00:36:35.113
I'll tell Section Chief Gong to take you.

499
00:36:35.115 --> 00:36:39.323
Oh? You want me to eat alone?

500
00:36:41.082 --> 00:36:44.452
Section Chief Gong, about the meeting...

501
00:36:45.738 --> 00:36:47.084
push it back one hour.

502
00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:50.705
- All right.
- My eldest son is the best.

503
00:36:51.323 --> 00:36:55.002
Let's go eat paninis.
I want to eat a panini.

504
00:37:01.763 --> 00:37:04.327
I could not find the Hello Kitty.

505
00:37:04.328 --> 00:37:06.111
We need to go to Plan B.

506
00:37:08.785 --> 00:37:10.392
- Let's go.
- Okay.

507
00:37:20.044 --> 00:37:22.066
<i>Operation Plan B.</i>

508
00:37:48.718 --> 00:37:50.153
What are you doing?

509
00:37:50.153 --> 00:37:51.327
What does it look like?

510
00:37:51.327 --> 00:37:52.573
I told you not to get involved.

511
00:37:52.573 --> 00:37:54.289
Get out if you don't
want to get involved.

512
00:37:55.901 --> 00:37:57.470
Let's go in together, Joon.

513
00:38:29.323 --> 00:38:31.633
Hey, don't make it obvious
that you were in here.

514
00:38:31.633 --> 00:38:33.475
Don't move all the stuff around.

515
00:38:33.475 --> 00:38:34.769
Okay, okay. Shh.

516
00:38:34.769 --> 00:38:36.607
Chief Byun is a total neat freak.

517
00:38:36.607 --> 00:38:38.738
He will know right away
if anything is out of place.

518
00:38:43.832 --> 00:38:46.269
Oh! Here it is.

519
00:38:46.269 --> 00:38:47.819
You found it?

520
00:38:53.102 --> 00:38:55.510
Hello, kitty.

521
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.600
You're not just going to take it, right?

522
00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.720
No, we have make sure
he doesn't notice it's gone.

523
00:39:09.426 --> 00:39:12.617
Oh, so cool.

524
00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:16.189
Isn't Joon so smart, Jae Hoon?

525
00:39:19.901 --> 00:39:23.231
Don't worry. Hyuk's mom
will be delaying him.

526
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:35.229
You should eat some too.

527
00:39:46.477 --> 00:39:48.180
Section Chief Gong, it's me.

528
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.323
Go to my office and look over
the documents from Strategic Planning.

529
00:39:51.323 --> 00:39:52.461
Yes.

530
00:40:02.459 --> 00:40:04.792
Wait! Wait.

531
00:40:04.792 --> 00:40:06.540
Yes, hold on.

532
00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.213
You startled me. What is it?

533
00:40:11.256 --> 00:40:12.734
What is it? Who is that?

534
00:40:12.734 --> 00:40:13.885
<i>What is it?</i>

535
00:40:14.919 --> 00:40:16.666
What is it? Who is that?

536
00:40:16.666 --> 00:40:19.035
Hide! Hide, hide, hide.

537
00:40:20.124 --> 00:40:23.997
No, I just thought I waxed that.

538
00:40:23.999 --> 00:40:25.099
Waxed?

539
00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:28.227
I thought about it.

540
00:40:28.227 --> 00:40:32.706
I don't think I did...
I didn't wax this spot.

541
00:40:32.706 --> 00:40:34.892
- Sorry.
- What the heck?

542
00:40:34.892 --> 00:40:36.704
I only did one side.

543
00:40:36.704 --> 00:40:39.593
Uh, wait. Excuse me. Wait...

544
00:40:46.356 --> 00:40:50.392
Oh, Section Chief Kwon.
What are you doing here?

545
00:40:50.392 --> 00:40:54.409
I dropped by to see Chief Byun,
but he wasn't here.

546
00:40:57.157 --> 00:41:00.468
His mother came by,
so he had to step out.

547
00:41:00.468 --> 00:41:03.959
The marketing meeting
was pushed back one hour.

548
00:41:03.959 --> 00:41:05.961
Come back later.

549
00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.360
Ah... all right.

550
00:41:15.952 --> 00:41:17.287
Aren't you leaving?

551
00:41:18.343 --> 00:41:20.084
I am leaving. Yes.

552
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:48.599
- It's done.
- Done?

553
00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:49.802
Okay.

554
00:42:05.034 --> 00:42:07.693
Operation complete.

555
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.365
- Joon.
- Huh?

556
00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:16.680
Why are you so good to me?

557
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.421
Why would you ask something like that?

558
00:42:18.421 --> 00:42:20.662
You did so much for us.

559
00:42:20.662 --> 00:42:23.631
Still, I'm really touched by this.

560
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:25.139
Are you?

561
00:42:25.139 --> 00:42:26.590
Yes, I am.

562
00:42:28.311 --> 00:42:31.182
Take this up and show
the CEO that you're innocent.

563
00:42:34.523 --> 00:42:35.791
Why aren't you going?

564
00:42:41.008 --> 00:42:42.191
Thank you.

565
00:42:47.019 --> 00:42:48.093
Yeah.

566
00:43:05.043 --> 00:43:06.974
Mother, I should get going now.

567
00:43:06.974 --> 00:43:08.334
You and Hyuk...

568
00:43:09.363 --> 00:43:13.494
it's my wish that
the two of you get along well.

569
00:43:13.494 --> 00:43:15.994
I don't like your father's ways.

570
00:43:15.994 --> 00:43:18.166
You are his older brother.

571
00:43:19.535 --> 00:43:23.476
Don't fight with your younger brother
and just get along, okay?

572
00:43:31.351 --> 00:43:34.711
<i>It's a sign of my sincerity.</i>

573
00:43:34.711 --> 00:43:36.985
<i>It's all part of the affection...</i>

574
00:43:36.985 --> 00:43:40.432
This scene and...

575
00:43:40.432 --> 00:43:42.678
<i>CEO, don't do this.
I won't take this.</i>

576
00:43:42.678 --> 00:43:45.059
<i>If you keep doing this,
I'll be very hurt.</i>

577
00:43:46.077 --> 00:43:47.954
- <i>If you keep doing this...</i>
- This scene too.

578
00:43:50.354 --> 00:43:54.512
Now, you can see where
these pictures came from, right?

579
00:43:56.077 --> 00:44:02.311
So, these were specifically captured
from a video to make you look bad?

580
00:44:02.313 --> 00:44:04.213
- Is that it?
- Yes.

581
00:44:04.213 --> 00:44:08.273
Your brother used a disgraceful
method to frame you.

582
00:44:12.805 --> 00:44:16.269
Honestly, I don't want
to believe that Woo Sung did it.

583
00:44:16.269 --> 00:44:17.798
What is this now?

584
00:44:17.798 --> 00:44:21.985
If you have the opportunity,
you should end his life.

585
00:44:21.985 --> 00:44:25.816
You have to stomp people out so
no one can do this to you again.

586
00:44:25.816 --> 00:44:27.834
What? End his life?

587
00:44:27.834 --> 00:44:31.168
I'm not doing this to win
or stomp people out.

588
00:44:33.294 --> 00:44:34.468
Then why?

589
00:44:34.468 --> 00:44:36.635
I just want to change things.

590
00:44:37.814 --> 00:44:39.184
What?

591
00:44:39.184 --> 00:44:43.030
First, please stop working
with companies that use bribes.

592
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:46.769
A company that slanders people
like this is doomed anyway.

593
00:44:46.769 --> 00:44:47.930
Is that all?

594
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.735
Yes, that's all for now.

595
00:44:50.767 --> 00:44:51.818
Bye now.

596
00:45:00.019 --> 00:45:01.400
That rascal.

597
00:45:03.756 --> 00:45:08.311
It seems like you've
lost this time, Woo Sung.

598
00:45:21.595 --> 00:45:22.992
Hey!

599
00:45:29.695 --> 00:45:30.831
Really?

600
00:45:30.831 --> 00:45:33.771
Is Hyuk free of that accusation now?

601
00:45:33.771 --> 00:45:36.546
Yes, I think so.

602
00:45:36.546 --> 00:45:37.896
Oh, I'm so relieved.

603
00:45:39.329 --> 00:45:41.331
I'm sorry to have asked you
for a difficult favor.

604
00:45:41.331 --> 00:45:43.517
No, I'm okay.

605
00:45:43.517 --> 00:45:46.559
I haven't had such excitement
in so long. It was fun.

606
00:45:48.827 --> 00:45:50.898
By the way, Joon.

607
00:45:50.898 --> 00:45:54.646
How long are you going
to continue cleaning?

608
00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.541
Until I find a part-time job
that pays very well.

609
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:01.651
Why?

610
00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:06.133
Because it's a waste of such
a bright, smart girl like you.

611
00:46:06.133 --> 00:46:09.461
Hey, what's your dream?

612
00:46:09.461 --> 00:46:11.508
Was there something you wanted to be?

613
00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:19.211
I don't know.

614
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:32.220
<i>Joon, what's your dream?</i>

615
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.369
<i>My dream?</i>

616
00:46:34.369 --> 00:46:36.550
<i>Was there something you wanted to be?</i>

617
00:46:38.769 --> 00:46:40.765
<i>I never thought about it.</i>

618
00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:46.160
<i>I thought about
who I shouldn't live like.</i>

619
00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.316
<i>So, thinking about how I should live...</i>

620
00:46:49.552 --> 00:46:51.044
<i>was something I hadn't done.</i>

621
00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:17.175
Oh, you look cool.

622
00:47:20.144 --> 00:47:21.586
Done working?

623
00:47:21.586 --> 00:47:22.914
Yes, done.

624
00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.070
Should I go for a drive?

625
00:47:35.608 --> 00:47:38.280
If you step on it slowly,
it'll go forward.

626
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.756
- It just goes?
- Yes.

627
00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:41.586
- Slowly, slowly, slowly.
- I'm going.

628
00:47:42.871 --> 00:47:45.010
Careful, careful, careful.

629
00:47:47.336 --> 00:47:48.887
Be careful.

630
00:47:48.887 --> 00:47:50.941
- Oh.
- I'll do one round.

631
00:47:50.941 --> 00:47:52.640
- You're pretty good.
- Am I?

632
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.789
- Okay.
- No hands.

633
00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:57.166
Be careful there.

634
00:47:57.166 --> 00:47:58.869
<i>Joon.</i>

635
00:47:58.869 --> 00:48:05.849
<i>If I had not met you,
how would I be living today?</i>

636
00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:07.557
<i>Joon.</i>

637
00:48:07.557 --> 00:48:13.108
<i>If you are not here,
how will I live tomorrow?</i>

638
00:48:32.303 --> 00:48:33.374
Joon.

639
00:48:37.039 --> 00:48:38.349
Just one more time...

640
00:48:39.776 --> 00:48:41.157
can we confirm to see?

641
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:45.342
What?

642
00:49:29.753 --> 00:49:31.796
Hyuk.

643
00:49:31.796 --> 00:49:32.936
Byun Hyuk?

644
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.751
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

645
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:38.872
What are you doing?

646
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:41.050
Hm?

647
00:49:42.843 --> 00:49:46.012
Yeah... I wonder.

648
00:49:46.012 --> 00:49:48.912
What was I imagining?

649
00:49:48.912 --> 00:49:52.642
I wonder why I was imagining that?

650
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.381
Gosh, seriously.

651
00:50:00.381 --> 00:50:02.626
<i>Joon, what are you doing now?</i>

652
00:50:07.082 --> 00:50:09.467
- Hyuk.
- Huh?

653
00:50:09.467 --> 00:50:11.287
Do you want to go on a date?

654
00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:16.296
What? Really?

655
00:50:16.296 --> 00:50:17.842
For real!

656
00:50:17.842 --> 00:50:21.088
Really? Really!

657
00:50:21.088 --> 00:50:24.264
Wow, wow!

658
00:50:24.264 --> 00:50:27.593
Let's go, let's go. We're going now.

659
00:50:27.593 --> 00:50:30.497
- Hold on tight. We're going.
- Hurry.

660
00:50:30.497 --> 00:50:33.747
Hold on tight and we're going.

661
00:50:38.133 --> 00:50:39.896
Be careful. Be careful.

662
00:50:46.472 --> 00:50:47.793
Byun Hyuk.

663
00:50:47.793 --> 00:50:50.517
This thing is pretty fast.

664
00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.195
This is pretty good.

665
00:51:15.287 --> 00:51:18.077
What? A date?

666
00:51:18.077 --> 00:51:21.247
Yes, a date.

667
00:51:21.247 --> 00:51:23.968
Do you have time today?

668
00:51:27.467 --> 00:51:28.916
I don't know.

669
00:51:28.916 --> 00:51:31.555
See you in front
of the building after work.

670
00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:59.698
Byun Hyuk? Did he go somewhere?

671
00:51:59.698 --> 00:52:01.918
He left work right on time.

672
00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:05.188
Wow, Third Generation.
He's really something.

673
00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:08.403
You need get rest in order to work well.

674
00:52:08.403 --> 00:52:10.421
You should go home too,
Section Chief Yang.

675
00:52:12.363 --> 00:52:14.813
What? You're leaving right
on time too, Section Chief Kwon?

676
00:52:14.813 --> 00:52:17.822
Yes, I finished my work. Bye.

677
00:52:22.744 --> 00:52:26.872
So, what? You all agree?

678
00:52:26.872 --> 00:52:29.631
Fine, then. You can all go home.

679
00:52:29.631 --> 00:52:32.503
- Really?
- Thank you, Section Chief.

680
00:52:32.503 --> 00:52:34.974
I'll stay alone and finish up.

681
00:52:34.974 --> 00:52:36.314
I have lots of work to do.

682
00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:06.443
Are you leaving now?

683
00:53:07.575 --> 00:53:10.807
I thought you'd stick around
because of Section Chief Yang.

684
00:53:10.807 --> 00:53:13.887
You... haven't left yet?

685
00:53:13.887 --> 00:53:16.066
I did but I was waiting for you.

686
00:53:16.066 --> 00:53:18.204
- Me?
- Joon!

687
00:53:20.269 --> 00:53:21.387
Oh!

688
00:53:22.727 --> 00:53:25.280
You finished earlier than I thought.

689
00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.905
Section Chief Yang didn't say anything?

690
00:53:29.927 --> 00:53:31.601
What is going on here?

691
00:53:31.601 --> 00:53:35.488
What else? I told you before, a date.

692
00:53:35.488 --> 00:53:38.072
- Oh, there she is.
- Who?

693
00:53:39.101 --> 00:53:41.079
Yeon Hee, over here!

694
00:53:41.079 --> 00:53:42.704
Oh, hi!

695
00:53:46.014 --> 00:53:47.244
Hello.

696
00:53:49.838 --> 00:53:54.079
All you people who work so hard.

697
00:53:54.079 --> 00:53:56.519
Let's go have some fun for once.

698
00:53:56.519 --> 00:53:57.829
Sounds good.

699
00:53:57.829 --> 00:54:00.939
Let's go, Joon. Let's go, Jae Hoon.
Let's go, Yeon Hee.

700
00:54:00.939 --> 00:54:01.967
Okay.

701
00:54:06.889 --> 00:54:08.086
Shall we go?

702
00:54:30.796 --> 00:54:33.057
Jae Hoon, Jae Hoon!

703
00:54:33.057 --> 00:54:34.151
Jae Hoon.

704
00:54:42.269 --> 00:54:43.780
- Should we rest?
- Yeah.

705
00:54:48.291 --> 00:54:49.572
Go over to him.

706
00:54:56.822 --> 00:54:58.503
Why aren't you skating, Jae Hoon?

707
00:54:58.503 --> 00:55:00.264
They look better together
than I imagined.

708
00:55:00.264 --> 00:55:03.798
Will our Kwon Jae Hoon
finally get a girlfriend?

709
00:55:03.798 --> 00:55:04.947
I wonder.

710
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:11.550
Oh?

711
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:21.724
What's with that?
Are they leaving together already?

712
00:55:21.724 --> 00:55:23.340
I guess so.

713
00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.793
Kwon Jae Hoon has
more spirit than I thought.

714
00:55:25.793 --> 00:55:28.053
Should we get going too?

715
00:55:28.053 --> 00:55:30.039
- Where?
- Wherever.

716
00:55:30.039 --> 00:55:31.488
Anywhere, as long as you are there.

717
00:55:33.947 --> 00:55:35.885
It's cold. Let's go home.

718
00:55:37.707 --> 00:55:40.075
Joon! Baek Joon!

719
00:55:40.075 --> 00:55:43.878
Hey, let's go on our date.
We should have our date too.

720
00:55:45.677 --> 00:55:49.188
Where should we go, Jae Hoon?
Should we go for coffee?

721
00:55:49.188 --> 00:55:53.008
Well, I'm okay with soju
instead of coffee.

722
00:55:53.008 --> 00:55:55.371
I know a street vendor
with good fish cake soup.

723
00:55:55.371 --> 00:55:57.588
Should we go there?

724
00:55:57.588 --> 00:56:01.227
No, a street vendor wouldn't be
so great on a day like today.

725
00:56:01.227 --> 00:56:05.137
Should we go to a nice wine bar nearby?

726
00:56:11.477 --> 00:56:12.769
Yeon Hee.

727
00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:15.072
Yes, Jae Hoon.
Where should we go?

728
00:56:15.072 --> 00:56:19.287
I think that Joon and Hyuk
did a stupid thing.

729
00:56:20.608 --> 00:56:21.724
What?

730
00:56:21.724 --> 00:56:23.407
There's a woman I like.

731
00:56:26.773 --> 00:56:29.936
If I don't tell you this
and I just drag it out...

732
00:56:29.936 --> 00:56:32.378
I would be doing you a disservice.

733
00:56:32.378 --> 00:56:34.139
That's why I'm telling you.

734
00:56:35.253 --> 00:56:36.367
I'm sorry.

735
00:56:38.367 --> 00:56:39.528
No.

736
00:56:41.012 --> 00:56:43.246
There's no need for you
to be sorry, Jae Hoon.

737
00:56:44.546 --> 00:56:46.044
You don't need to be.

738
00:56:47.144 --> 00:56:51.541
I didn't come out because I was
that interested in you or anything.

739
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:57.064
Joon and Third Generation were
pushing me into it so much.

740
00:56:58.255 --> 00:57:01.416
I'm okay. I really am.

741
00:57:02.735 --> 00:57:05.914
I was half forced into coming out.

742
00:57:05.914 --> 00:57:07.343
That's a relief then.

743
00:57:08.436 --> 00:57:09.568
What?

744
00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:12.115
A relief?

745
00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:24.905
You really have no manners,
Kwon Jae Hoon.

746
00:57:42.267 --> 00:57:45.488
Please give us two hot Americanos.

747
00:57:45.488 --> 00:57:46.713
Yes, of course.

748
00:57:47.704 --> 00:57:50.563
Wow, this is very unique and new.

749
00:57:50.563 --> 00:57:52.180
I wonder if they're hiring.

750
00:58:00.164 --> 00:58:03.164
I wonder if Jae Hoon is doing okay.

751
00:58:03.164 --> 00:58:04.347
I don't know.

752
00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:07.057
He's so stiff that I hope
he doesn't get dumped.

753
00:58:07.057 --> 00:58:08.285
Here you go.

754
00:58:08.285 --> 00:58:09.602
Thank you.

755
00:58:15.305 --> 00:58:16.465
It's Jae Hoon!

756
00:58:19.026 --> 00:58:21.322
Huh? Why is he alone?

757
00:58:25.742 --> 00:58:26.852
Jae Hoon!

758
00:58:26.852 --> 00:58:28.095
Kwon Jae Hoon!

759
00:58:29.954 --> 00:58:31.780
Where is Yeon Hee?
Why are you alone?

760
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.501
You two just left together, not long ago.

761
00:58:37.751 --> 00:58:40.303
What is it? Did something happen?

762
00:58:44.825 --> 00:58:46.394
I really think I'm going insane.

763
00:58:52.784 --> 00:58:56.343
I think he's really angry.

764
00:58:56.343 --> 00:58:57.765
You're right.

765
00:58:57.765 --> 00:58:59.246
Why is he acting like that?

766
00:59:34.523 --> 00:59:36.479
Kwon Jae Hoon, you jerk.

767
00:59:44.684 --> 00:59:47.343
He got me all confused.

768
00:59:47.343 --> 00:59:49.381
What?

769
00:59:49.381 --> 00:59:51.311
There's a woman he likes?

770
00:59:58.744 --> 01:00:00.490
Ma'am!

771
01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.684
One more bottle of soju please.

772
01:00:02.684 --> 01:00:03.713
Coming.

773
01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:27.099
Please go. I want to be alone.

774
01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.697
It doesn't taste good if you drink alone.

775
01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.967
Are you upset about something?

776
01:00:42.023 --> 01:00:43.311
That jerk.

777
01:00:44.581 --> 01:00:47.262
Kwon Jae Hoon, you jerk.

778
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.394
Kwon Jae Hoon, you jerk!

779
01:01:08.793 --> 01:01:09.963
Are you okay?

780
01:01:27.791 --> 01:01:30.019
What exactly happened?

781
01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:32.090
I know they left together.

782
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:35.840
So, why would they separate so fast
and come back alone?

783
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.309
I know, right?

784
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:40.249
Kwon Jae Hoon is such a prickly jerk.

785
01:01:40.249 --> 01:01:41.550
I can see why it happened.

786
01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:44.916
Ah, just one more drink.
Just one more.

787
01:01:44.916 --> 01:01:46.108
What is that?

788
01:01:46.108 --> 01:01:48.003
Just one, huh?

789
01:01:48.003 --> 01:01:50.633
You drank lots, Yeon Hee.
Go on inside.

790
01:01:50.633 --> 01:01:53.012
Oh, come on.

791
01:01:53.012 --> 01:01:56.396
Salute, I'll even do that.

792
01:01:56.396 --> 01:02:00.756
So, just one more.
Let's go have one more.

793
01:02:00.756 --> 01:02:03.218
No, you cannot. I'm going in.

794
01:02:03.218 --> 01:02:04.918
One drink.

795
01:02:04.918 --> 01:02:06.639
I don't want to.

796
01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:08.041
Hey, no.

797
01:02:11.682 --> 01:02:12.881
No...

798
01:02:14.209 --> 01:02:15.390
Wow.

799
01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:20.669
So tiring.

800
01:02:20.669 --> 01:02:21.934
Excuse me.

801
01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.914
Am I heavy?

802
01:02:24.914 --> 01:02:25.954
No.

803
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:31.086
Was Kwon Jae Hoon dumped by Yeon Hee?

804
01:02:31.086 --> 01:02:32.345
Huh?

805
01:02:40.188 --> 01:02:42.499
Jae Hoon, are you sleeping?

806
01:02:42.499 --> 01:02:45.809
Be quiet. Just sleep.

807
01:02:45.809 --> 01:02:46.820
Okay.

808
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:53.985
<i>Kwon Jae Hoon is in a terrible mood.</i>

809
01:02:53.985 --> 01:02:55.834
<i>I think he did get dumped.</i>

810
01:03:03.575 --> 01:03:05.673
<i>[Kwon Jae Hoon is in a terrible mood.
I think he did get dumped.]</i>

811
01:03:17.747 --> 01:03:19.280
I really think I'm going insane.

812
01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:46.454
<i>[Three years ago]</i>

813
01:03:46.454 --> 01:03:49.423
It's small, old,
and the location isn't great.

814
01:03:49.423 --> 01:03:50.843
Let's go somewhere else then.

815
01:03:55.608 --> 01:03:56.932
Kwon Jae Hoon?

816
01:04:00.818 --> 01:04:02.840
It's been a long time.

817
01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.289
What are you doing here?

818
01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:08.059
Do you... live here?

819
01:04:08.059 --> 01:04:10.300
Yes, what about you?

820
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:11.351
Me?

821
01:04:14.925 --> 01:04:17.099
- I'm going to move here.
- What?

822
01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:19.789
Really?

823
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:20.919
Yes.

824
01:04:45.197 --> 01:04:48.352
You brought in a proposal that's lowering
the company's margin by one percent.

825
01:04:50.313 --> 01:04:52.414
What are you thinking,
Managing Director Seol?

826
01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:58.412
We are at a disadvantage
when it comes to group lunches.

827
01:04:58.412 --> 01:05:03.293
As a strategy to increase our market,
organic foods are necessary.

828
01:05:04.552 --> 01:05:07.090
Think of the long-term, CEO.

829
01:05:07.092 --> 01:05:11.048
The lunches are a limited market anyway.

830
01:05:12.267 --> 01:05:14.126
We don't want to proceed recklessly

831
01:05:14.126 --> 01:05:15.986
by alienating our existing
business partners.

832
01:05:15.986 --> 01:05:18.577
Which business partners?

833
01:05:18.577 --> 01:05:19.798
BS.

834
01:05:21.968 --> 01:05:24.088
BS? You're sure about that?

835
01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:25.206
<i>I'm sure.</i>

836
01:05:25.206 --> 01:05:28.601
<i>Hangang Food Products,
Hangang Containers, Hangang Packaging...</i>

837
01:05:28.601 --> 01:05:32.677
BS is the parent company of
all three companies.

838
01:05:32.677 --> 01:05:34.376
Who is the real owner of BS?

839
01:05:34.376 --> 01:05:36.021
<i>That's the mysterious part.</i>

840
01:05:36.021 --> 01:05:39.197
It isn't public who the shareholders are.

841
01:05:39.197 --> 01:05:41.762
CEO Min is just the owner on paper.

842
01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.845
Oh yeah.

843
01:05:47.847 --> 01:05:51.077
Do you know a company called BS?

844
01:05:57.749 --> 01:05:59.910
You should know better.

845
01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:03.102
I don't know what to think when
you bring proposals like this.

846
01:06:03.102 --> 01:06:05.021
Please fix it and resubmit it.

847
01:06:06.352 --> 01:06:08.651
Do you agree, CEO Byun?

848
01:06:13.389 --> 01:06:15.124
Do as Woo Sung says.

849
01:06:15.124 --> 01:06:17.025
Discard this.

850
01:06:22.084 --> 01:06:23.441
Just do it.

851
01:06:31.727 --> 01:06:32.843
Manager Kim.

852
01:06:32.843 --> 01:06:36.894
Reorganize that proposal you submitted
before and give it to me.

853
01:06:36.894 --> 01:06:39.079
It needs to be given
to Managing Director Seol.

854
01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:40.186
Yes, all right.

855
01:06:40.186 --> 01:06:42.914
Mister Kim Ki Sub,
stop what you were working on.

856
01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:46.548
What? Stop?

857
01:06:46.548 --> 01:06:48.088
What happened, Section Chief Yang?

858
01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:49.311
I told you.

859
01:06:49.311 --> 01:06:52.200
Didn't I say the bosses
wouldn't let it pass?

860
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.456
The CEO put a stop to
the proposal from Director Seol.

861
01:06:55.456 --> 01:06:57.595
He ordered us to work with
the existing companies.

862
01:06:57.595 --> 01:06:59.249
Just know that and don't argue about it.

863
01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:03.099
I'm already totally annoyed
that I have to do the same thing twice.

864
01:07:15.407 --> 01:07:18.285
<i>Is this because of the company called BS?</i>

865
01:07:18.285 --> 01:07:22.434
Do you want to stay quiet and
work in this company for a long time?

866
01:07:23.553 --> 01:07:27.153
Then don't ask any questions.

867
01:07:27.153 --> 01:07:28.365
Do as you are told.

868
01:07:30.019 --> 01:07:33.856
Is it the type of company
that I'm imagining it to be?

869
01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:39.238
Who owns BS anyway?

870
01:07:43.218 --> 01:07:45.387
Who is the owner of BS?

871
01:07:45.389 --> 01:07:48.258
Who is it that you overturn
the managing director's decision?

872
01:07:48.258 --> 01:07:49.918
You don't need to know.

873
01:07:49.918 --> 01:07:52.628
The decisions have already been made.

874
01:07:52.628 --> 01:07:54.693
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Father!

875
01:07:54.693 --> 01:07:58.595
By the way, are you still close
to that girl, Baek Joon?

876
01:07:58.595 --> 01:08:00.671
I thought you were
supposed to end things.

877
01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:03.555
When you have feelings for someone,
how can you end things?

878
01:08:03.555 --> 01:08:06.327
You'll end up ending things
by getting hurt.

879
01:08:06.327 --> 01:08:08.278
You two are born to end up that way.

880
01:08:08.278 --> 01:08:10.320
There's a gap that you can't overcome.

881
01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:14.010
How much did you wrong her father
that you're acting like this?

882
01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:16.982
Can't you apologize to Joon now
for what happened then?

883
01:08:16.982 --> 01:08:19.795
Why would I apologize, you punk!

884
01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:21.871
It was Baek Sung Ki
who put me in danger.

885
01:08:21.871 --> 01:08:24.512
So, you framed him for bribery
and kicked him out?

886
01:08:24.512 --> 01:08:26.844
So, what are you saying?

887
01:08:26.844 --> 01:08:30.223
Are you going to go up against me?

888
01:08:30.223 --> 01:08:31.707
I told you, Father.

889
01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:34.567
I'm not trying to fight.
I just want to change things.

890
01:08:35.638 --> 01:08:37.677
You're going to change me?

891
01:08:37.677 --> 01:08:39.607
If that's the way to change the company.

892
01:08:51.098 --> 01:08:55.737
There's nothing you can change
without facing it head on and fighting.

893
01:08:55.737 --> 01:08:58.577
If you want to change
the company, fight and win.

894
01:08:58.577 --> 01:09:00.893
Start with your brother, Woo Sung.

895
01:09:00.893 --> 01:09:02.402
After that...

896
01:09:04.983 --> 01:09:06.689
I will face you.

897
01:09:15.286 --> 01:09:18.616
<i>Father, what is it that you're hiding?</i>

898
01:09:20.045 --> 01:09:23.075
<i>Can we expose it?</i>

899
01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:30.661
