<i>[Episode 11]</i>

3
00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:29.618
Hello. I'll be working on the
Strategic Planning team with you.

4
00:00:29.618 --> 00:00:31.051
My name is Kim Ki Sub.

5
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:34.635
I am a one-year contract employee,
but I promise to work hard.

6
00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:37.440
Think of me as the rookie.

7
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.172
Work me as hard as you like.

8
00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.970
Let's work well together.

9
00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.109
Bravo.

10
00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.453
What is it?

11
00:00:58.005 --> 00:00:59.645
What happened, Hyuk?

12
00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:02.275
A former cleaner now has a one-year
contract in Strategic Planning?

13
00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:04.124
What did you do?

14
00:01:04.124 --> 00:01:06.007
Are you curious, my friend?

15
00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:09.945
I'll give you a reward,
so tell me if you want something.

16
00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:11.079
A reward?

17
00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.831
<i>So, I thought about it.</i>

18
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:27.897
I think this is the one.

19
00:01:31.707 --> 00:01:34.410
Let's go with a luxury car.

20
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.102
<i>Should I get a fast sports car?</i>

21
00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:38.809
Wow!

22
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.233
Yeah...

23
00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.722
This is really nice.

24
00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:48.457
<i>Should I get a home with a great view?</i>

25
00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:50.609
We can sign the contract right away?

26
00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:09.941
<i>Cash could be the most useful.</i>

27
00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:16.525
However, I am Byun Hyuk.

28
00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:19.513
I did decide to be revolutionary,
just like my name.

29
00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:26.810
They were the hidden workers
behind that commendation.

30
00:02:28.137 --> 00:02:32.380
Hire them onto the management team
as experienced employees.

31
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.451
So, the chairman allowed that?

32
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:36.732
Yes!

33
00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:39.600
How come only Mister Kim got a job?

34
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.139
Only one person would
pass to get hired here.

35
00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:48.138
They all pitched in and it would
be unfair to choose just him.

36
00:02:48.138 --> 00:02:52.108
Do I run a soup kitchen
where I have distribute fairly?

37
00:02:52.108 --> 00:02:56.750
A company only hires
the people they need.

38
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.141
- Father.
- What, kid?

39
00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:00.716
Father.

40
00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:03.496
Suppose you all did
the same work and made a pie.

41
00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:07.056
Then they all left you out
and ate the pie.

42
00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:09.368
Would you feel good or bad?

43
00:03:09.368 --> 00:03:13.318
Oh yeah? Then, I'll be fair...

44
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.663
and not hire anyone.

45
00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:23.195
No, please don't do that. Thank you.

46
00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:25.024
There you go.

47
00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:27.744
Ki Sub, wait up.

48
00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:29.923
Come along.

49
00:03:29.923 --> 00:03:31.579
Good work today.

50
00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:35.478
Oh, what do I do?

51
00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:39.061
Pie...

52
00:03:39.838 --> 00:03:41.298
Gosh.

53
00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:46.066
Honey, I'm home.

54
00:03:49.614 --> 00:03:52.168
Have you had dinner?

55
00:03:56.845 --> 00:04:00.113
I told you to eat.

56
00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:01.822
Should I give you your meal?

57
00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.937
Did you have a good day today, Mother?

58
00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:12.125
<i>Where's the tutoring academy
money for the kids?</i>

59
00:05:14.687 --> 00:05:16.175
Sorry.

60
00:05:16.704 --> 00:05:19.716
The rent for my room went up this month.

61
00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:21.666
<i>I don't even expect child support.</i>

62
00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:24.969
<i>At least, you should give me money
for the tutoring academy.</i>

63
00:05:26.815 --> 00:05:28.825
I'll send it soon.

64
00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:30.497
Are the kids doing well?

65
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:32.726
Can you put Eun Ji on the phone?

66
00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:35.336
<i>Hi, Dad. Are you doing well?</i>

67
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:38.464
Of course, your dad's doing great.

68
00:05:38.464 --> 00:05:41.226
<i>Dad, when are you coming to see me?</i>

69
00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:46.236
Oh, my youngest daughter,
I'll go see you this weekend.

70
00:05:46.236 --> 00:05:48.454
<i>Don't bother coming.
Just send the money.</i>

71
00:06:08.457 --> 00:06:10.209
This is the right place.

72
00:06:11.396 --> 00:06:12.954
Mister Byun.

73
00:06:15.322 --> 00:06:16.937
Mister!

74
00:06:20.507 --> 00:06:21.947
What did you just say?

75
00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.839
It's not a full-time job.
It's a one-year contract.

76
00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:27.687
You'd be an employee without rank.

77
00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:28.880
Would that be all right?

78
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.392
I would do it. Of course, I would.

79
00:06:32.007 --> 00:06:36.007
But... we all did it together.

80
00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:38.217
Is it okay for me to go in alone?

81
00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:40.135
Of course, it's okay.

82
00:06:40.135 --> 00:06:41.555
Mister Lee.

83
00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:43.824
We're a little late, right?

84
00:06:48.976 --> 00:06:51.687
Wait. How did you all know to come?

85
00:06:51.687 --> 00:06:53.319
I contacted them.

86
00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:58.488
I recommended all three of you,
but only Mister Kim got hired.

87
00:06:58.988 --> 00:07:00.647
I'm sorry to the two of you.

88
00:07:00.647 --> 00:07:04.957
There's no need to say such a thing.
No need to be sorry.

89
00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:08.716
You're a master of PR and marketing,
so of course they'd hire you.

90
00:07:08.716 --> 00:07:11.507
Madam Ahn and I wouldn't be applicable.

91
00:07:11.507 --> 00:07:13.635
We understand, okay?

92
00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:17.127
Even if things go well
for one of us, that's great.

93
00:07:17.127 --> 00:07:20.640
I really want to
congratulate you, Mister Kim.

94
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.493
Come on now.

95
00:07:22.493 --> 00:07:26.553
Since we're here to congratulate you,
let's have a celebratory drink.

96
00:07:26.553 --> 00:07:29.892
To the brother we love...

97
00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.793
we truly congratulate you
on getting a job again.

98
00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:41.998
Thank you, everyone.
I really am thankful.

99
00:07:41.998 --> 00:07:44.587
- Cheers!
- Congratulations!

100
00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:46.057
Congratulations!

101
00:07:50.548 --> 00:07:53.183
See you at work tomorrow.

102
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.390
And that's what happened.
What do you think?

103
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.942
Aren't I kind of cool, huh?

104
00:07:58.942 --> 00:08:00.803
No.

105
00:08:00.803 --> 00:08:03.250
No? You said no?

106
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.074
- Not at all?
- Not at all.

107
00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:09.009
You seemed to be deluding yourself,
thinking you did something great...

108
00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:11.716
He's not delusional. It was great.

109
00:08:11.716 --> 00:08:13.897
Good job, Byun Hyuk. It's very cool.

110
00:08:13.897 --> 00:08:15.248
Right, Joon?

111
00:08:15.248 --> 00:08:17.111
Don't you think this is irrational?

112
00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:20.611
You have to be irrational
every now and then in life.

113
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:23.750
Also, it's not Hyuk's style
to play it safe.

114
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.425
Of course! A company where
a person who retired can return.

115
00:08:27.425 --> 00:08:28.526
It's nice.

116
00:08:28.526 --> 00:08:32.001
If Mister Kim succeeds,
then it can open the path for others.

117
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:36.310
With the years of experience he has,
I'm sure he'll do a good job.

118
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.478
He's been retired
for more than five years.

119
00:08:38.478 --> 00:08:42.398
It's been a long time and he's lost
his touch, so can he really do well?

120
00:08:42.398 --> 00:08:47.035
Do you really think he'll be
so happy to be back?

121
00:08:52.694 --> 00:08:55.677
Let's work well together, Ms. Sang Hee.

122
00:08:55.677 --> 00:08:57.075
Here you go.

123
00:08:57.075 --> 00:08:59.469
Let's work well together.

124
00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:03.302
Here you go.

125
00:09:04.597 --> 00:09:07.056
Let's work well together,
Section Chief Yang.

126
00:09:07.056 --> 00:09:08.753
Thank you.

127
00:09:08.753 --> 00:09:11.531
Yes... oh, oh.

128
00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:15.137
Here you go.

129
00:09:16.983 --> 00:09:20.188
Let's work well together,
Section Chief Kwon.

130
00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:25.275
Let's work well together, Ms. Hyun Joo.

131
00:09:25.275 --> 00:09:26.666
Thank you.

132
00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:29.526
Let's work well together,
Mister Yong Joon.

133
00:09:33.354 --> 00:09:36.647
Let's work well together,
Mister Byun Hyuk.

134
00:09:36.647 --> 00:09:39.309
Mister, there's no need for this.

135
00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:41.936
Still, I am the rookie here.
I should do what's expected.

136
00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:43.835
Hey, Mister Byun Hyuk.

137
00:09:43.835 --> 00:09:47.377
Call him by his proper title.

138
00:09:48.405 --> 00:09:50.382
Section Chief Yang is correct.

139
00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:53.999
You can call me Mister Kim Ki Sub.

140
00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:56.272
Still, I don't want to
call him by his name...

141
00:09:56.272 --> 00:09:59.858
Can't I just call him my junior?

142
00:09:59.858 --> 00:10:02.720
Junior Kim.

143
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.128
That's not bad... Sir.

144
00:10:05.128 --> 00:10:06.589
Senior Byun.

145
00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:09.200
- Junior Kim.
- Senior Byun.

146
00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:13.544
Just don't look.

147
00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:05.331
What should I wear to look good?

148
00:11:14.734 --> 00:11:15.945
Mom, are you going somewhere?

149
00:11:15.945 --> 00:11:20.521
Se Na, what should I wear
to look elegant and intelligent?

150
00:11:21.315 --> 00:11:25.477
No, maybe I should go for
an independent image.

151
00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.026
I feel like she might like that.

152
00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:29.805
You have to look good for someone?

153
00:11:29.805 --> 00:11:32.117
Who is it, anyway? Tell me.

154
00:11:32.117 --> 00:11:35.845
Just someone who's
independent and intelligent.

155
00:11:51.306 --> 00:11:53.435
Madam, she's coming.

156
00:11:53.435 --> 00:11:55.796
Where? Where, where?

157
00:11:55.796 --> 00:11:57.454
From over there.

158
00:11:59.022 --> 00:12:01.963
Stay here, Driver Kwon.

159
00:12:01.963 --> 00:12:03.099
All right.

160
00:12:13.493 --> 00:12:16.393
Excuse me. Excuse me... I, I...

161
00:12:16.393 --> 00:12:19.405
Oh my. Hey, hey, hey!

162
00:12:21.882 --> 00:12:23.219
Me?

163
00:12:38.108 --> 00:12:40.858
Oh! Goodness.

164
00:12:41.776 --> 00:12:43.972
Oh my!

165
00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:46.146
What is this?

166
00:12:46.146 --> 00:12:48.757
Hey, you jerk! Do you want to die!

167
00:12:48.757 --> 00:12:50.506
We almost got hurt!

168
00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:53.042
Gosh, that was dangerous.

169
00:12:53.042 --> 00:12:55.650
Oh, you're so tough.

170
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.804
Are you all right? Are you hurt at all?

171
00:12:57.804 --> 00:13:00.004
Oh, I'm okay.

172
00:13:00.004 --> 00:13:01.815
I'm safe, thanks to you.

173
00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:04.416
How about you? Are you hurt?

174
00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:05.762
I'll be fine.

175
00:13:07.165 --> 00:13:09.762
What will you do?
Your clothes are all wet.

176
00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:13.974
I know, and I spent
so much time picking this out.

177
00:13:13.974 --> 00:13:15.275
Goodness.

178
00:13:15.275 --> 00:13:17.922
My place happens to be up there.

179
00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:21.049
Would you like to come
and dry your clothes?

180
00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:23.579
- Really?
- Yes, if that's okay with you.

181
00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:27.089
It's okay with me. It's very okay.

182
00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:28.275
You must be cold.

183
00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:30.199
Oh, it's cold... so cold.

184
00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:32.182
- We're almost there.
- Really?

185
00:13:33.752 --> 00:13:35.286
It's here. Come on up.

186
00:13:35.286 --> 00:13:36.374
Ah, yes.

187
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.379
- So cold.
- Mom!

188
00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.276
Joon, you're home?

189
00:13:45.276 --> 00:13:46.574
Who...

190
00:13:46.574 --> 00:13:48.860
- Just up front...
- Oh, is this your mother?

191
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.358
Yes.

192
00:13:50.358 --> 00:13:53.362
Oh, hello.

193
00:13:53.362 --> 00:13:56.612
Yes, hello. Who are you?

194
00:13:56.612 --> 00:14:00.002
Oh, my son lives here
on the second floor.

195
00:14:00.002 --> 00:14:01.691
- The second floor?
- Yes.

196
00:14:01.691 --> 00:14:04.061
Oh my, oh my!

197
00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:06.142
That young man who works at Gangsu Group?

198
00:14:06.142 --> 00:14:07.944
Yes, he's my son.

199
00:14:07.944 --> 00:14:10.083
<i>So, Hyuk's mother?</i>

200
00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:15.071
I was wondering who raised
such a great son and it was you.

201
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:18.300
He's tall, handsome, and smart.

202
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.372
Yes, yes.

203
00:14:20.372 --> 00:14:24.281
He's already a section chief at that age.
You must be so happy.

204
00:14:24.281 --> 00:14:27.741
What? A... a section chief?

205
00:14:28.295 --> 00:14:32.805
<i>Mom, not Kwon Jae Hoon.
She's here for Hyuk.</i>

206
00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:35.464
Now that you mention it,
you must be worried lately.

207
00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:39.753
Someone has latched onto
your son like a bed bug lately.

208
00:14:39.753 --> 00:14:43.483
A bed bug? What do you mean?

209
00:14:44.998 --> 00:14:46.262
Hold on.

210
00:14:46.262 --> 00:14:49.036
You didn't know? Oh, you didn't.

211
00:14:49.036 --> 00:14:52.568
A friend latched onto Jae Hoon
like a bed bug not too long ago.

212
00:14:52.568 --> 00:14:55.722
A very annoying friend
seems to have moved in.

213
00:14:55.722 --> 00:14:59.100
His name is... I think it was Hyuk.

214
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.967
Right, Joon?
That young bed bug man is Byun Hyuk.

215
00:15:03.436 --> 00:15:06.853
<i>[Bed bug]
Huh? My Hyuk is a bed bug?</i>

216
00:15:06.853 --> 00:15:09.309
You must be cold.

217
00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:11.652
You should get inside over there.

218
00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:15.200
Bed bug? A bed bug...

219
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.234
Make sure that the bedbug is paying his
share of expenses since you're here.

220
00:15:20.234 --> 00:15:22.637
It seems like he's even
eating your son's food.

221
00:15:22.637 --> 00:15:24.201
Stop it.

222
00:15:27.377 --> 00:15:28.954
Why?

223
00:15:29.968 --> 00:15:31.975
Please look into it.

224
00:15:31.975 --> 00:15:34.450
One has to make good friends.

225
00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:37.588
Forget it. You're wrong.

226
00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:46.886
I'm sorry.

227
00:15:47.607 --> 00:15:50.850
My mom didn't really know
and made a mistake.

228
00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:55.709
I'm sorry too for
not telling you who I was.

229
00:15:55.709 --> 00:16:00.623
She may be surprised once she knows,
so keep it a secret from your mom.

230
00:16:00.623 --> 00:16:01.912
Okay.

231
00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:05.713
Still, a bed bug...

232
00:16:05.713 --> 00:16:08.938
It's a little shocking.

233
00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:15.703
- I'll call Hyuk to see when he's coming.
- No.

234
00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:17.555
I didn't come to see Hyuk.

235
00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:19.146
What?

236
00:16:20.752 --> 00:16:22.936
I came to see you.

237
00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:25.709
Baek Joon, right?

238
00:16:26.734 --> 00:16:28.209
Yes.

239
00:16:29.213 --> 00:16:33.578
I'm not good at talking in circles,
so I'll get to the point.

240
00:16:34.283 --> 00:16:39.239
Miss, what's your relationship
with my Hyuk?

241
00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:41.718
We're just friends.

242
00:16:41.718 --> 00:16:47.310
Come on, not the diplomatic answer,
but your real relationship.

243
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:51.188
What have you two promised each other?

244
00:16:52.196 --> 00:16:54.759
We really are just friends.

245
00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:58.406
Hyuk and I haven't promised
each other anything either.

246
00:16:58.406 --> 00:17:01.378
Why not? What's with my Hyuk?

247
00:17:01.378 --> 00:17:04.056
Does he not satisfy you?

248
00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:05.737
Is it his lack of education?

249
00:17:05.737 --> 00:17:07.598
Or because he gets into trouble?

250
00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:09.266
No, it's not that.

251
00:17:09.266 --> 00:17:12.804
Hey, he might've been investigated
by the police, but he has no record.

252
00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:15.855
Also, he went through
a traumatic event in high school.

253
00:17:15.855 --> 00:17:20.034
He had trouble after that.
He studied very well before that.

254
00:17:20.034 --> 00:17:21.718
He is not a bed bug at all.

255
00:17:21.718 --> 00:17:24.258
Hyuk doesn't have that
kind of image at all.

256
00:17:24.258 --> 00:17:26.889
Yes, I know that.

257
00:17:28.889 --> 00:17:33.264
What kind image has Hyuk
been making for himself?

258
00:17:33.264 --> 00:17:35.737
Seriously, so annoying.

259
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:41.249
What is this?

260
00:17:42.846 --> 00:17:44.884
Oh, what is this?

261
00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:13.620
It would help to increase the chart.

262
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.921
What? Oh, sure.

263
00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:17.597
I'll take care of it.

264
00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:20.424
Yes, okay.

265
00:18:25.797 --> 00:18:28.908
I think there's an error
in the market research here.

266
00:18:28.908 --> 00:18:30.276
What's wrong with it?

267
00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.946
It needs a seasonal analysis.

268
00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:37.591
Alcohol is a product that's
sensitive to weather and seasons.

269
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:39.179
Excuse me.

270
00:18:39.179 --> 00:18:43.418
I've got this, so please
just focus on your own work.

271
00:18:43.418 --> 00:18:46.610
Oh... I should.

272
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:51.103
I suppose I should know my place.

273
00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:53.274
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:02.853 --> 00:19:06.446
Hey, attention, everyone.

275
00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:07.476
Pay attention.

276
00:19:07.476 --> 00:19:10.845
We got one of the projects from
the food service department.

277
00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:14.046
We need to make a proposal for
the school lunches this week.

278
00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:15.503
School lunch proposal?

279
00:19:15.503 --> 00:19:18.902
These will be submitted into the system
and there will be a bid for the contract.

280
00:19:18.902 --> 00:19:21.497
Everyone needs to focus.

281
00:19:21.497 --> 00:19:23.283
Section Chief Kwon,
I want you to do one.

282
00:19:23.283 --> 00:19:26.507
Manager Kim and Sang Hyun,
do one each and give it to me.

283
00:19:26.507 --> 00:19:29.693
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes, I understand.

284
00:19:29.693 --> 00:19:31.071
Section Chief Yang!

285
00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:34.091
Should Junior Kim and I do one too?

286
00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:35.812
No, don't do it.

287
00:19:35.812 --> 00:19:39.082
You always try to butt in
when you don't know what it is.

288
00:19:39.082 --> 00:19:40.477
Do I?

289
00:19:44.076 --> 00:19:47.702
Why don't you try it, Mister Kim Ki Sub?

290
00:19:47.702 --> 00:19:49.104
What?

291
00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:57.419
Yes, I'll put in
my best effort and do so.

292
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.702
Byun Hyuk, you follow me.

293
00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:07.142
I want to try making a proposal too.

294
00:20:07.142 --> 00:20:10.297
You can't even use Excel properly.

295
00:20:10.297 --> 00:20:13.325
- Don't complain and follow me.
- Okay.

296
00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:17.385
Where are we going so late anyway?

297
00:20:17.385 --> 00:20:19.003
Section Chief Yang!

298
00:20:25.448 --> 00:20:36.440
<i>Bounce with me, bounce with me.
Bounce with me, bounce.</i>

299
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.301
How can you suddenly ask us
to lower our unit price?

300
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:41.921
Are you asking us to die,
Section Chief Yang?

301
00:20:41.921 --> 00:20:44.523
I'm just saying take in a smaller margin.

302
00:20:44.523 --> 00:20:46.668
I keep getting orders from my bosses.

303
00:20:46.668 --> 00:20:49.931
What can I do about it? Nothing.

304
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:51.279
I...

305
00:20:52.565 --> 00:20:56.229
We have a good relationship
though, don't we?

306
00:20:56.229 --> 00:20:57.622
Please save me this once.

307
00:20:57.622 --> 00:20:59.684
Oh, don't do this. Stop it.

308
00:20:59.684 --> 00:21:02.247
Oh goodness.

309
00:21:03.706 --> 00:21:06.568
You were supposed to
lower unit prices by two percent.

310
00:21:06.568 --> 00:21:09.044
I guess we'll have to
go with one percent.

311
00:21:09.044 --> 00:21:10.394
You're driving me insane.

312
00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:12.198
I just can't win with you.

313
00:21:12.198 --> 00:21:14.567
Thank you, Section Chief Yang.
You're all I have.

314
00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:17.346
Why don't you come
have a drink too, Intern?

315
00:21:17.346 --> 00:21:19.575
Have a drink? I'll pour you a drink.

316
00:21:19.575 --> 00:21:21.886
Have a drink. Have a drink.

317
00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:24.947
Oh my. Let's work well together.

318
00:21:26.469 --> 00:21:28.482
Here. Drink up.

319
00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:30.728
You saw that, right?

320
00:21:30.728 --> 00:21:33.152
You push and pull
depending on the situation.

321
00:21:33.152 --> 00:21:35.722
This is the beauty of negotiating.

322
00:21:35.722 --> 00:21:40.100
It didn't look like negotiating,
but more like bullying him out of money.

323
00:21:42.458 --> 00:21:45.771
You only intended to lower it
by one percent to begin with.

324
00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:48.192
Hey, that's all a skill.

325
00:21:48.192 --> 00:21:50.363
I'm happy to achieve my goal.

326
00:21:50.363 --> 00:21:53.774
The subcontractor is happy to think
they got a discount on the decrease.

327
00:21:53.774 --> 00:21:56.853
You get your cake and eat it too.
Everyone is happy.

328
00:21:56.853 --> 00:21:59.219
Ah, I see.

329
00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:03.706
Section Chief Yang, you really
are a powerful member our team.

330
00:22:04.988 --> 00:22:06.536
A powerful member?

331
00:22:09.206 --> 00:22:11.663
You really do know
what you're talking about.

332
00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:14.883
So, you should learn from me.

333
00:22:14.883 --> 00:22:17.816
I'm not saying this because
you're the owner's son.

334
00:22:17.816 --> 00:22:22.295
If you follow a boss like me,
it will help you manage the company.

335
00:22:22.295 --> 00:22:23.598
Is that right?

336
00:22:23.598 --> 00:22:28.770
I will specially mentor you,
so learn well from me.

337
00:22:30.537 --> 00:22:33.556
Ah, it's cold.

338
00:22:46.109 --> 00:22:49.895
Driver Kwon, it must be nice
to have raised such a good son.

339
00:22:49.895 --> 00:22:50.901
Pardon?

340
00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:54.715
He's tall, handsome, and even smart.

341
00:22:54.715 --> 00:22:58.216
Oh my. It's not like I raised him.

342
00:22:58.216 --> 00:23:00.421
He grew up on his own.

343
00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:06.282
He may be my child,
but I didn't do anything for Jae Hoon.

344
00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:24.180
Joon... Joon!

345
00:23:25.132 --> 00:23:26.396
Did you work late?

346
00:23:26.396 --> 00:23:28.315
Are you going out to do
designated driving?

347
00:23:28.315 --> 00:23:30.998
I wish you would stop.

348
00:23:32.846 --> 00:23:37.468
Our Joon, I worry that
you'll get into a car accident.

349
00:23:38.186 --> 00:23:39.572
What's this?

350
00:23:40.815 --> 00:23:42.726
Did you drink?

351
00:23:42.726 --> 00:23:44.991
Yes, a little bit.

352
00:23:45.785 --> 00:23:48.124
Oh, your mom came a while ago.

353
00:23:48.124 --> 00:23:51.287
- Mom? Whose mom?
- Your mom.

354
00:23:52.643 --> 00:23:54.354
- My mom?
- Yes.

355
00:23:54.354 --> 00:23:55.994
My mom?

356
00:24:04.816 --> 00:24:07.701
Oh. Oh my, oh my!

357
00:24:08.537 --> 00:24:11.667
How can kimchi taste like this?

358
00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:14.247
Yum! Oh my goodness.

359
00:24:14.247 --> 00:24:16.461
Oh, it is so delicious.

360
00:24:24.717 --> 00:24:26.126
Yes, Hyuk.

361
00:24:26.126 --> 00:24:28.297
Mom, you met Joon?

362
00:24:28.297 --> 00:24:30.006
Yes, I did.

363
00:24:30.006 --> 00:24:32.738
Mom, you didn't even tell me beforehand.

364
00:24:32.738 --> 00:24:37.067
How can you meet her on your own
and make her feel taken aback?

365
00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:43.428
So, what did you think of her?

366
00:24:43.428 --> 00:24:44.833
She's great, right? Awesome, right?

367
00:24:44.833 --> 00:24:46.953
I thought she'd be great.

368
00:24:46.953 --> 00:24:49.154
What? You didn't like her, Mom?

369
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:51.594
Now, that I met her in person...

370
00:24:51.594 --> 00:24:53.694
she is just really, really great.

371
00:24:53.694 --> 00:24:56.386
She's so great.

372
00:24:56.814 --> 00:25:00.316
Right? I knew you would like her too.

373
00:25:00.316 --> 00:25:04.903
But, Hyuk... you need to
get your act together now.

374
00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:06.716
Why?

375
00:25:06.716 --> 00:25:10.586
It seems that Joon's mom
has her heart set on Jae Hoon.

376
00:25:10.586 --> 00:25:13.756
What? Joon's mom?

377
00:25:13.756 --> 00:25:17.551
My mom? What about my mom?

378
00:25:19.133 --> 00:25:21.696
She says the kimchi is so good.

379
00:25:21.696 --> 00:25:22.826
She says thank you.

380
00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:25.192
Oh, I was wondering what it was.

381
00:25:26.555 --> 00:25:29.526
Okay, let's hang up and talk later.

382
00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:32.646
Okay. Go get 'em, Hyuk!

383
00:25:32.646 --> 00:25:35.366
All right. Love you. Bye.

384
00:25:40.315 --> 00:25:42.805
<i>Joon's mom and Jae Hoon?</i>

385
00:25:42.805 --> 00:25:45.112
<i>Is that so?</i>

386
00:26:17.827 --> 00:26:20.988
Please take a look, Section Chief Kwon.

387
00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:30.577
The unit cost is too high.

388
00:26:30.577 --> 00:26:32.080
You need to lower it.

389
00:26:32.642 --> 00:26:34.621
Because it's food for children

390
00:26:34.621 --> 00:26:39.304
I felt it was best to use organic
products, even if it costs more.

391
00:26:39.304 --> 00:26:42.235
Who doesn't know that
organic products are good?

392
00:26:42.235 --> 00:26:46.423
Isn't the important thing whether
we can get win the contract or not?

393
00:26:47.094 --> 00:26:48.549
Yes.

394
00:26:49.535 --> 00:26:51.048
Do it again.

395
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:53.734
All right.

396
00:26:56.284 --> 00:26:59.251
You have Hyuk's tailbone
stuck in your back.

397
00:27:00.504 --> 00:27:02.178
You know that, right?

398
00:27:03.423 --> 00:27:08.814
You will have to show with your
own skill why you should stay here.

399
00:27:08.814 --> 00:27:10.360
Otherwise...

400
00:27:11.019 --> 00:27:15.597
it won't just be you in an
awkward position, but Hyuk as well.

401
00:28:04.969 --> 00:28:06.101
<i>Hold on to me.</i>

402
00:28:13.237 --> 00:28:14.697
Wait a moment.

403
00:28:21.133 --> 00:28:22.382
There you go.

404
00:28:24.404 --> 00:28:26.016
What am I to do?

405
00:28:32.574 --> 00:28:34.796
- Who is it?
- <i>Your neighbor.</i>

406
00:28:43.384 --> 00:28:44.538
What is it?

407
00:28:44.538 --> 00:28:45.768
Rice cakes for moving in.

408
00:28:45.768 --> 00:28:47.688
What? Rice cakes for moving in?

409
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.757
At this hour?

410
00:28:53.055 --> 00:28:54.304
You moved in a while ago.

411
00:28:54.304 --> 00:28:59.328
Your timing for distributing
rice cakes is a little odd.

412
00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:03.475
- This is what the rooftop looks like.
- What?

413
00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.924
What's your relationship with
the men on the second floor?

414
00:29:05.924 --> 00:29:08.066
How long have you known them?

415
00:29:08.927 --> 00:29:10.918
What are you doing right now?

416
00:29:13.046 --> 00:29:16.065
Sorry, it's a habit of my job.

417
00:29:16.967 --> 00:29:19.466
Anyway, I'll enjoy
the rice cakes, T-1000.

418
00:29:28.514 --> 00:29:33.302
You must enjoy being tall,
handsome, and so smart.

419
00:29:33.302 --> 00:29:34.361
What are you saying?

420
00:29:34.361 --> 00:29:36.583
Since when were you such
a favorite of Joon's mom?

421
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.401
What are you referring to now?

422
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.905
Who could that be at this hour?

423
00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:43.998
Is it Joon? Joon!

424
00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:48.215
Is that you, Joon?

425
00:29:51.801 --> 00:29:52.905
T-1000.

426
00:29:55.924 --> 00:29:58.015
What is it? What's going on?

427
00:29:59.257 --> 00:30:00.892
These are rice cakes for my move-in.

428
00:30:00.892 --> 00:30:02.211
Rice cakes?

429
00:30:04.508 --> 00:30:08.344
Wow, you just opened up
the entire floor here.

430
00:30:08.344 --> 00:30:09.834
Do you own it?

431
00:30:10.524 --> 00:30:13.148
Do you have a deposit on it
or is it just a monthly rent?

432
00:30:13.148 --> 00:30:14.391
What is this?

433
00:30:15.081 --> 00:30:17.230
Monthly rent would be very expensive.

434
00:30:18.478 --> 00:30:21.393
How long have you two
been living together?

435
00:30:22.371 --> 00:30:24.763
Since that incident?

436
00:30:24.763 --> 00:30:28.037
I feel like we're being
interrogated here.

437
00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:31.230
Sorry, it's a habit with my job.

438
00:30:31.741 --> 00:30:35.486
Why don't you be honest?
Why did you move here?

439
00:30:35.486 --> 00:30:38.062
Do I need a reason to move anywhere?

440
00:30:38.062 --> 00:30:39.873
You move if you like the place.

441
00:30:39.873 --> 00:30:42.054
You want me to believe
that it's just a coincidence?

442
00:30:42.054 --> 00:30:44.910
It seems you're uncomfortable living
in the same building as me.

443
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:48.962
Honestly, it is bothersome.

444
00:30:48.962 --> 00:30:50.671
Why does it bother you?

445
00:30:51.276 --> 00:30:53.873
Do you feel guilty about something?

446
00:30:53.873 --> 00:30:55.106
There's nothing like that.

447
00:30:55.915 --> 00:30:58.485
That's a relief to hear.

448
00:31:00.605 --> 00:31:01.946
This is good!

449
00:31:02.487 --> 00:31:04.986
I brought it from
my aunt's rice cake shop.

450
00:31:04.986 --> 00:31:07.815
Oh, she must be very skilled.

451
00:31:07.815 --> 00:31:08.885
It's been open for 30 years.

452
00:31:08.885 --> 00:31:11.103
No wonder the taste has depth, 30 years.

453
00:31:11.723 --> 00:31:14.814
If you have no further business,
please leave.

454
00:31:16.596 --> 00:31:18.509
Yes, then.

455
00:31:19.348 --> 00:31:20.507
By the way...

456
00:31:21.507 --> 00:31:25.003
I caught one of the
most wanted criminals not too long ago.

457
00:31:25.003 --> 00:31:26.834
So, I got a special promotion.

458
00:31:26.834 --> 00:31:29.946
I could choose the department
I wanted when I got promoted.

459
00:31:29.946 --> 00:31:33.380
I transferred to the
financial crimes team.

460
00:31:35.056 --> 00:31:36.056
Bye, then.

461
00:31:38.235 --> 00:31:41.534
Must be a good place,
the financial crimes team.

462
00:31:41.534 --> 00:31:42.892
What is that?

463
00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:46.571
You don't need to know.
Eat your rice cakes.

464
00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:53.987
Yum. It's good.

465
00:32:16.011 --> 00:32:19.243
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E11 Revolutionary Love</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

466
00:32:44.668 --> 00:32:48.615
I went in to clean the restroom and
he was wiping blood from his nose.

467
00:32:48.615 --> 00:32:50.652
I think he stayed at work all night.

468
00:32:50.652 --> 00:32:52.775
He had a nosebleed in the morning
and it was no joke.

469
00:33:32.824 --> 00:33:34.181
Are you kidding around?

470
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:38.544
Barely anything has changed
since yesterday.

471
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.263
I am discussing things
with the suppliers.

472
00:33:42.263 --> 00:33:45.622
Without even a estimated figure in mind,
how can you talk to the suppliers?

473
00:33:45.622 --> 00:33:47.441
Will that help you with the unit cost?

474
00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:50.929
Still, these are
school lunches for children.

475
00:33:52.048 --> 00:33:53.199
Do it again.

476
00:34:05.864 --> 00:34:07.274
Hey, Jae Hoon.

477
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:14.288
Call me by my proper title,
Mister Byun Hyuk.

478
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:16.526
I mean, Section Chief Kwon.

479
00:34:16.526 --> 00:34:19.183
Aren't you being too tough
on Junior Kim?

480
00:34:19.183 --> 00:34:20.319
How am I being tough?

481
00:34:20.319 --> 00:34:22.328
Junior Kim spent all night on it.

482
00:34:22.328 --> 00:34:24.256
Can't you see he's trying
to get the unit cost right?

483
00:34:24.256 --> 00:34:25.964
He's not the only one
who works all night.

484
00:34:25.964 --> 00:34:29.205
Everyone on our team works late and
has spent all night working before.

485
00:34:29.205 --> 00:34:32.399
Are you asking for special treatment
because you placed him there?

486
00:34:32.399 --> 00:34:35.325
Are you sure you're not seeing him
differently because of that?

487
00:34:35.325 --> 00:34:37.413
He is an experienced employee.

488
00:34:37.413 --> 00:34:39.000
What good is that?

489
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.484
He's an idealist who doesn't
suit the current reality.

490
00:34:41.484 --> 00:34:44.013
People like that cannot succeed.

491
00:34:44.013 --> 00:34:48.319
That's why he got pushed out of
his previous company so quickly.

492
00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:51.428
So, all idealists have to get pushed out?

493
00:34:51.428 --> 00:34:53.587
- What?
- They're not items you use.

494
00:34:53.587 --> 00:34:56.187
Isn't it wrong to
treat people like products?

495
00:34:56.187 --> 00:34:57.763
It's like Joon's dad.

496
00:34:57.763 --> 00:35:00.033
The revival of a retired man.

497
00:35:00.033 --> 00:35:03.861
Is that what you wanted to show Joon?

498
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:07.038
Then wake up from your dream,
Mister Byun Hyuk.

499
00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:08.930
A company is not
that kind of an organization.

500
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:14.718
Especially not Gangsu Group
run by CEO Byun Gang Su.

501
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:28.201
Oh no.

502
00:35:28.201 --> 00:35:31.315
I'm not trying to get you
to lower your prices.

503
00:35:31.315 --> 00:35:35.267
It's just that these foods would
be used in lunches for children.

504
00:35:35.267 --> 00:35:38.031
Hello? Hello?

505
00:35:40.257 --> 00:35:42.948
Didn't even listen to me.

506
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:56.748
Hello, I'm calling from the
Strategic Planning team at Gangsu Group.

507
00:35:56.748 --> 00:36:01.790
You know the dumplings
that you supply for us?

508
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:07.469
I'm calling to see if we could
adjust the unit cost of them.

509
00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:10.948
Wait. Please don't hang up. Hello?

510
00:36:18.207 --> 00:36:20.330
May we sit down with you?

511
00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.288
Yes, hurry up and sit down.

512
00:36:26.042 --> 00:36:29.241
I get to sit down and have a meal
with someone in a tie.

513
00:36:29.241 --> 00:36:30.569
It is a great honor.

514
00:36:30.569 --> 00:36:33.027
Don't say such nonsense.

515
00:36:35.518 --> 00:36:38.256
How is work lately?

516
00:36:38.256 --> 00:36:41.446
I'm just getting used to it.

517
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.652
Let me take a look.

518
00:36:47.216 --> 00:36:50.085
Spicy rice cakes, 3,000 won.
Sauce, 1,900 won.

519
00:36:50.085 --> 00:36:55.969
Ki Sub, the unit costs
are too high on this proposal.

520
00:36:55.969 --> 00:36:59.417
It was because it's food for children.

521
00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:01.605
I wanted to use high quality products.

522
00:37:01.605 --> 00:37:04.857
You can't negotiate prices
over the phone.

523
00:37:04.857 --> 00:37:07.893
You have to go look them
in the face and do it.

524
00:37:08.446 --> 00:37:11.672
Yes, but it's not just one place.

525
00:37:11.672 --> 00:37:14.261
It's a bit much to do on my own...

526
00:37:14.261 --> 00:37:17.489
- Why are you alone, Mister?
- Huh?

527
00:37:17.489 --> 00:37:21.089
What are you all doing this weekend?
Should get some country air?

528
00:37:21.089 --> 00:37:22.196
Sounds good.

529
00:37:22.196 --> 00:37:24.375
Well, I'm busy, so... I'm in.

530
00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:25.433
Hey.

531
00:37:29.252 --> 00:37:31.435
Today, we're meeting
a food product company.

532
00:37:31.435 --> 00:37:35.866
If things go well with this person,
we can lower costs of our products.

533
00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.609
Oh, you're already here.

534
00:37:41.609 --> 00:37:42.765
Section Chief Yang.

535
00:37:43.236 --> 00:37:46.098
It's an honor to drink
with you here. Thank you.

536
00:37:48.234 --> 00:37:49.569
CEO Min?

537
00:37:49.569 --> 00:37:53.230
Oh, Third Generation.
It's been a long time.

538
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.520
It's nice to see you.

539
00:37:55.053 --> 00:37:56.924
Please sit down. Sit down.

540
00:37:56.924 --> 00:37:58.924
Section Chief Yang, what's going on?

541
00:37:58.924 --> 00:38:01.064
He's the CEO of the company.

542
00:38:01.064 --> 00:38:02.473
Is something wrong?

543
00:38:02.473 --> 00:38:05.515
<i>Yes, something is wrong.</i>

544
00:38:05.515 --> 00:38:07.205
Come on, Mister Byun Hyuk.

545
00:38:07.205 --> 00:38:08.955
Let's forget our bad past.

546
00:38:08.955 --> 00:38:11.254
I may have closed down
the cleaning business.

547
00:38:11.254 --> 00:38:12.884
But I have no grudges.

548
00:38:12.884 --> 00:38:14.417
Come and sit down.

549
00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:15.839
Why aren't you sitting down?

550
00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:18.020
We need to make a deal on the price.

551
00:38:18.236 --> 00:38:20.018
Come on.

552
00:38:20.018 --> 00:38:24.277
All right, let's forget about our past.

553
00:38:24.277 --> 00:38:26.315
Let's just think about work.

554
00:38:26.315 --> 00:38:28.167
Section Chief Yang,
please have a drink.

555
00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:29.839
Thank you very much.

556
00:38:30.794 --> 00:38:31.893
Mister Byun Hyuk.

557
00:38:33.265 --> 00:38:35.149
Here you are...

558
00:38:36.098 --> 00:38:39.033
Cheers, everyone. Cheers!

559
00:38:39.033 --> 00:38:41.948
Cheers!

560
00:38:43.948 --> 00:38:47.489
<i>Something feels very wrong.</i>

561
00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:08.033
<i>[Kim Ki Sub]</i>

562
00:39:31.372 --> 00:39:32.477
Hyuk.

563
00:39:35.328 --> 00:39:37.844
Oh... it's Joon.

564
00:39:38.353 --> 00:39:39.587
Joon.

565
00:39:41.997 --> 00:39:44.564
What? Did you drink again?

566
00:39:45.812 --> 00:39:47.285
I did drink.

567
00:39:47.285 --> 00:39:51.895
If you placed Mister Kim in that job,
you should take responsibility and help.

568
00:39:51.895 --> 00:39:53.303
You've just been drinking instead?

569
00:39:53.303 --> 00:39:56.504
But, Joon... they say this is work too.

570
00:39:56.504 --> 00:39:57.725
Who said that?

571
00:39:57.725 --> 00:39:59.156
Section Chief Yang.

572
00:39:59.855 --> 00:40:02.886
So, I'm doing my best right now.

573
00:40:03.154 --> 00:40:07.596
I'm learning how Gangsu Foods
runs right now.

574
00:40:13.493 --> 00:40:16.571
You look tired. Go in and sleep.

575
00:40:29.924 --> 00:40:32.051
What... what are you doing?

576
00:40:38.102 --> 00:40:39.520
I'm going now.

577
00:40:50.274 --> 00:40:53.096
I missed you all day, Joon.

578
00:40:56.107 --> 00:40:58.178
Though you may not have felt the same.

579
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.714
It needs to be submitted tomorrow.

580
00:41:45.714 --> 00:41:47.602
How is it coming along?

581
00:41:48.102 --> 00:41:52.623
I think I should be able to lower
the costs of organic by five percent.

582
00:41:52.623 --> 00:41:55.145
You're insisting on organic
until the end?

583
00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:58.114
The trend with school lunches is organic.

584
00:41:58.114 --> 00:42:02.524
So, if Gangsu Foods can match
their foods to the trend.

585
00:42:02.524 --> 00:42:04.875
- I am sure that we can win.
- Stop.

586
00:42:05.953 --> 00:42:08.567
- Excuse me.
- Don't hold on to a failure.

587
00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:12.006
Make a proposal with regular food
products and submit it.

588
00:42:12.576 --> 00:42:13.806
Section Chief Kwon.

589
00:42:15.035 --> 00:42:16.377
Do as I say.

590
00:42:19.257 --> 00:42:20.602
But, wait...

591
00:42:52.292 --> 00:42:55.256
Jae Hoon, when did you get here?

592
00:42:56.116 --> 00:42:59.317
Hey, why are sleeping
in a place like this?

593
00:43:00.654 --> 00:43:02.618
I must've been really tired.

594
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:07.506
Go to a break room and sleep
properly if you're tired.

595
00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:17.142
Why's he getting mad?

596
00:43:19.696 --> 00:43:21.788
Oh, I slept well.

597
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:27.902
We're here!

598
00:43:27.902 --> 00:43:29.973
Come on in.

599
00:43:29.973 --> 00:43:31.808
It's nice to see you.

600
00:43:31.808 --> 00:43:34.259
The best thing for a hangover
is more drinking.

601
00:43:35.225 --> 00:43:36.915
CEO Min again?

602
00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:39.239
What is this, Section Chief Yang?

603
00:43:39.239 --> 00:43:41.819
We already agreed on prices
with him last night.

604
00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:44.116
Yesterday, that was food products.

605
00:43:44.116 --> 00:43:46.422
Today, we're going to
deal with food containers.

606
00:43:46.422 --> 00:43:47.502
Containers?

607
00:43:47.502 --> 00:43:50.007
Just sit down.
Are you going to stand all day?

608
00:43:50.007 --> 00:43:51.301
All right. Sit down.

609
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.196
Please sit down.

610
00:43:56.116 --> 00:43:59.806
CEO Min also owns
a food container company.

611
00:43:59.806 --> 00:44:01.689
How many companies do you own?

612
00:44:01.689 --> 00:44:04.303
Oh, not that many.

613
00:44:04.303 --> 00:44:09.210
I have a food product
and container company.

614
00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.964
Ah, I also have a company
that sells wrapping material.

615
00:44:14.848 --> 00:44:18.683
This is why I have to talk to CEO Min.

616
00:44:18.683 --> 00:44:20.573
If there's a bad proposal
for the school lunches

617
00:44:20.573 --> 00:44:25.156
I can resolve it all in one go
when I'm with CEO Min.

618
00:44:25.743 --> 00:44:27.696
Oh, please.

619
00:44:28.542 --> 00:44:31.810
I'm only able to make a living
because of Gangsu Foods.

620
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.183
CEO Min.

621
00:44:33.183 --> 00:44:37.707
I'm eating and living well
all thanks to you.

622
00:44:37.707 --> 00:44:39.007
Is that right?

623
00:44:39.506 --> 00:44:40.750
Have another drink.

624
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.625
<i>It's strange, just as I thought.</i>

625
00:44:42.625 --> 00:44:45.828
<i>Now, things are very strange.</i>

626
00:44:55.978 --> 00:44:57.565
Where is Mister Kim Ki Sub?

627
00:44:57.565 --> 00:45:01.408
He said he would go to the
suppliers himself to talk.

628
00:45:01.408 --> 00:45:02.808
So, he left.

629
00:45:02.808 --> 00:45:04.408
Talk to them himself?

630
00:45:04.408 --> 00:45:07.826
How can you ask that of me?
What am I supposed to live off of?

631
00:45:07.826 --> 00:45:11.747
Still, if you do this for us,
I'll return the favor one day.

632
00:45:11.747 --> 00:45:13.210
What am I supposed to eat then?

633
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.261
Get going.

634
00:45:14.261 --> 00:45:16.506
I have nothing more to say.
I said, just go.

635
00:45:16.506 --> 00:45:19.899
Oh my. Please have one of these.

636
00:45:19.899 --> 00:45:21.669
Ma'am, have one.

637
00:45:22.799 --> 00:45:24.497
Sir, here's one for you.

638
00:45:24.497 --> 00:45:27.913
Oh, just give that to me. I'll do it.

639
00:45:27.913 --> 00:45:30.163
Have this and just rest.

640
00:45:30.893 --> 00:45:33.993
Oh, yes. Talks are going well.

641
00:45:33.993 --> 00:45:35.181
How are things with you?

642
00:45:36.122 --> 00:45:38.265
Things aren't going so well for us.

643
00:45:38.265 --> 00:45:41.939
No, I decided to go
to the chicken factory.

644
00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:45.399
Mister Kim is going to
stay at the pig farm.

645
00:45:45.399 --> 00:45:48.100
Oh, Joon you must be so tired.

646
00:45:48.921 --> 00:45:50.940
Don't worry, Madam Ahn.

647
00:45:51.881 --> 00:45:53.620
I am just fine.

648
00:45:54.591 --> 00:45:56.611
Yes, let's talk again.

649
00:46:05.593 --> 00:46:07.102
Baek Joon?

650
00:46:07.672 --> 00:46:10.214
She already left with
Mister Lee and Madam Ahn.

651
00:46:11.163 --> 00:46:12.832
They must have something to do.

652
00:46:12.832 --> 00:46:15.814
They switched with the
evening shift employees and left.

653
00:46:15.814 --> 00:46:18.645
Ah... is that right?

654
00:46:20.864 --> 00:46:23.546
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

655
00:46:23.546 --> 00:46:26.355
- Ki Sub, the cabbage farm went well.
- <i>Okay.</i>

656
00:46:26.355 --> 00:46:27.897
<i>The pig farm is an "okay" too.</i>

657
00:46:28.544 --> 00:46:31.937
That's weird. Joon is not picking up.

658
00:46:31.937 --> 00:46:33.026
She's not picking up?

659
00:46:40.073 --> 00:46:41.643
Hm? What?

660
00:46:42.473 --> 00:46:45.283
Why is the battery running out now?

661
00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:50.205
What time is it?

662
00:46:56.873 --> 00:46:59.205
<i>[Store]</i>

663
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.611
Excuse me.

664
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.982
Do you need something?

665
00:47:11.982 --> 00:47:17.036
Grandma, the last bus time has passed,
but it's not coming.

666
00:47:17.036 --> 00:47:19.736
Oh, the schedule has changed.

667
00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:20.743
What?

668
00:47:20.743 --> 00:47:24.444
The schedule there
is the summer schedule.

669
00:47:24.444 --> 00:47:29.330
The bus stops running
a little earlier in the winter.

670
00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:30.672
What do I do?

671
00:47:32.803 --> 00:47:37.745
Grandma, I'm sorry,
but could you lend me your phone?

672
00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.212
Thank you.

673
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:53.049
<i>Our glasses clink together.
Cheers, cheers, cheers!</i>

674
00:47:53.049 --> 00:47:56.710
<i>You said you couldn't give me your heart.</i>

675
00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:00.330
<i>You said you could not love me.</i>

676
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:03.622
<i>Lonely, I look out the window.</i>

677
00:48:03.622 --> 00:48:06.723
<i>Drip, drip, drip, drip.</i>

678
00:48:06.723 --> 00:48:08.542
So old fashioned.

679
00:48:23.176 --> 00:48:24.709
<i>This caller is unavailable to take...</i>

680
00:48:51.424 --> 00:48:52.910
This is Kwon Jae Hoon.

681
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:54.587
Oh, Jae Hoon.

682
00:49:05.123 --> 00:49:07.634
Why isn't he coming?

683
00:50:22.305 --> 00:50:23.518
Jae Hoon.

684
00:50:24.582 --> 00:50:27.497
Sorry. Thanks for coming.

685
00:50:28.585 --> 00:50:30.569
It's cold. Get in the car.

686
00:50:45.656 --> 00:50:48.415
I didn't know that
the last bus time had changed.

687
00:50:48.415 --> 00:50:52.549
The old lady had to close the store
and my battery ran out.

688
00:50:54.138 --> 00:50:56.770
Do you have to get involved like this?

689
00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:58.098
I guess so.

690
00:50:58.098 --> 00:51:00.473
Mister Kim said this.

691
00:51:00.473 --> 00:51:05.667
When it comes to school lunches,
it's the same for rich or poor kids.

692
00:51:07.257 --> 00:51:10.113
So, he wanted to give them the best food.

693
00:51:10.113 --> 00:51:14.344
He felt like he could be proud
in front of his kids.

694
00:51:15.788 --> 00:51:18.882
It will be hard for it to pass anyway.

695
00:51:18.882 --> 00:51:20.553
Kwon Jae Hoon.

696
00:51:20.553 --> 00:51:23.232
What is it that you think
your company makes?

697
00:51:23.783 --> 00:51:26.252
It's not just some item.
It's food.

698
00:51:26.252 --> 00:51:29.263
Don't only think about
competition of prices.

699
00:51:29.263 --> 00:51:31.783
Shouldn't you approach it
from a different perspective?

700
00:51:31.783 --> 00:51:33.352
The work that you do...

701
00:51:36.763 --> 00:51:41.335
Mister Kim wanted to help you beat
Section Chief Yang, no matter what.

702
00:51:42.482 --> 00:51:44.895
That's why everyone worked so hard.

703
00:51:48.882 --> 00:51:52.382
Oh my. Let's go, let's go.
Get going!

704
00:51:58.047 --> 00:51:59.337
- Hm?
- Huh?

705
00:52:05.207 --> 00:52:07.286
It was acting up before so I fixed it.

706
00:52:07.286 --> 00:52:08.506
Why is it doing this again?

707
00:52:09.348 --> 00:52:11.890
It's not broken, is it?

708
00:52:27.035 --> 00:52:29.913
Joon! Are you sleeping, Joon?

709
00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:32.573
Let's have a beer if you're not!

710
00:52:32.573 --> 00:52:33.835
Joon!

711

Joon.

712
00:52:40.082 --> 00:52:41.689
Where did she go?

713
00:52:41.689 --> 00:52:43.319
Is she already out driving?

714
00:52:46.053 --> 00:52:47.397
Jae Hoon!

715
00:52:49.468 --> 00:52:51.127
My friend.

716
00:52:52.047 --> 00:52:53.647
My friend.

717

My friend...
(In Japanese)

718
00:53:03.107 --> 00:53:06.846
Why isn't Jae Hoon coming in
when it's so late?

719
00:53:07.747 --> 00:53:09.138
Is he working late?

What? Joon?

Yes, it's me. What?

727
00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:39.082
Jae Hoon, there's a problem!

728
00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:42.937
Mister Kim called me saying
they can't reach Joon.

729

What? You're with her?

Yes, we're together. We'll be late.

You don't need to know.
Don't wait up and go to bed.

00:54:18.933 --> 00:54:21.113

You did tell Hyuk not to wait up
and go to bed.

811
01:02:19.026 --> 01:02:21.365
What are you two
doing here in the morning?

812
01:02:21.365 --> 01:02:23.166
Joon, did nothing happen?

813
01:02:23.166 --> 01:02:24.644
Like what?

814
01:02:24.644 --> 01:02:25.950
Joon.

815
01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:28.561
Come see me for a bit.

816
01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:31.713
Jae Hoon!

817
01:02:32.755 --> 01:02:34.974
Jae Hoon... Jae Hoon!

818
01:02:35.265 --> 01:02:37.186
Jae Hoon, Jae Hoon...

819
01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:40.695
Hey, what happened to you two?

820
01:02:40.695 --> 01:02:43.057
What were you doing
with Kwon Jae Hoon until now?

821
01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:46.977
His car broke and we had
to fix it on the way here.

822
01:02:46.977 --> 01:02:49.352
Jae Hoon suffered because of me.

823
01:02:50.015 --> 01:02:52.374
Was that really it?

824
01:02:53.863 --> 01:02:55.546
What were you imagining?

825
01:02:56.796 --> 01:02:59.278
Kwon Jae Hoon and I just friends.

826
01:02:59.278 --> 01:03:00.467
That's all, right?

827
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:03.336
What could happen
when you're just friends?

828
01:03:03.336 --> 01:03:04.456
Right, Jae Hoon?

829
01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.269
Imagine whatever you want.

830
01:03:06.736 --> 01:03:07.887
What?

831
01:03:09.997 --> 01:03:13.168
No, no. I'm not going
to imagine anything.

832
01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:15.401
I won't imagine a thing, friend.

833
01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:18.727
Aren't you going to work?

834
01:03:26.704 --> 01:03:28.305
What's with that expression?

835
01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.925
Jae Hoon, Jae Hoon!

836
01:03:59.967 --> 01:04:03.124
Sorry, I decreased it as much as I could.

837
01:04:03.124 --> 01:04:04.184
That's fine.

838
01:04:04.912 --> 01:04:05.928
What?

839
01:04:07.246 --> 01:04:08.606
Submit this.

840
01:04:09.282 --> 01:04:10.372
What?

841
01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:29.691
You made this for me to submit?

842
01:04:30.247 --> 01:04:33.396
If you don't like it, Section Chief Yang,
I'll submit it myself.

843
01:04:33.396 --> 01:04:34.579
Hey, you...

844
01:04:35.968 --> 01:04:38.198
All right, let's suppose that you do.

845
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.769
How can the company decrease
our margin by one percent?

846
01:04:41.517 --> 01:04:43.628
That doesn't make sense. Forget it.

847
01:04:43.628 --> 01:04:46.771
We'll submit Manager Kim's,
so you can stay out of it.

848
01:04:47.168 --> 01:04:50.269
Why? Don't you have confidence?

849
01:04:52.526 --> 01:04:54.613
What? Hey, you punk...

850
01:04:55.345 --> 01:04:57.405
What do you mean by that?

851
01:04:57.856 --> 01:05:01.586
Why do you have so much confidence
in this proposal to keep pushing it?

852
01:05:02.077 --> 01:05:06.726
Whether it passes or not,
I want to show that it is possible.

853
01:05:07.305 --> 01:05:08.523
That's right.

854
01:05:08.523 --> 01:05:10.836
The final decision will be
made by people above us.

855
01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:16.443
Ah, yes. Do whatever you want, then.

856
01:05:16.963 --> 01:05:18.443
I will, then.

857
01:05:21.363 --> 01:05:22.581
Do whatever you want.

858
01:05:23.293 --> 01:05:24.456
Mister.

859
01:05:30.769 --> 01:05:33.470
I looked at both of
the proposals you submitted.

860
01:05:35.503 --> 01:05:36.727
We'll go with this one.

861
01:05:37.369 --> 01:05:38.939
I'm sorry, Managing Director Seol.

862
01:05:39.465 --> 01:05:42.387
We submitted two and caused confusion.

863
01:05:42.735 --> 01:05:44.954
- Not yours.
- Pardon me?

864
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:49.302
Section Chief Kwon, I chose yours.

865
01:05:50.481 --> 01:05:52.678
The company can give up some margin.

866
01:05:52.678 --> 01:05:56.389
In the long run,
I think we will profit.

867
01:05:57.099 --> 01:05:59.389
It was a fresh idea
that's following the trend.

868
01:06:00.211 --> 01:06:01.724
Good job, Section Chief Kwon.

869
01:06:08.072 --> 01:06:09.376
Why aren't you taking it?

870
01:06:11.106 --> 01:06:14.827
The person who prepared that
proposal is someone else.

871
01:06:23.847 --> 01:06:25.608
Mister Kim Ki Sub, come see me.

872
01:06:25.608 --> 01:06:26.742
Ah, yes.

873
01:06:37.255 --> 01:06:39.959
Your proposal was chosen.

874
01:06:40.836 --> 01:06:42.191
Go ahead with your plan.

875
01:06:42.939 --> 01:06:43.977
What?

876
01:06:44.655 --> 01:06:45.856
Really?

877
01:06:50.331 --> 01:06:51.976
Thank you, Section Chief Kwon.

878
01:06:54.046 --> 01:06:57.113
- Thank you so much.
- Yes!

879
01:06:59.032 --> 01:07:01.077
Oh, yes!

880
01:07:01.077 --> 01:07:03.838
Yes, yes, yes!

881
01:07:13.148 --> 01:07:16.209
Kim Ki Sub, Kim Ki Sub.

882
01:07:25.706 --> 01:07:27.242
Good luck, Kim Ki Sub!

883
01:07:31.892 --> 01:07:33.785
<i>What are you thinking anyway?</i>

884
01:07:33.785 --> 01:07:35.026
About what?

885
01:07:35.026 --> 01:07:39.314
I'm curious about what you're thinking
in bringing Kim Ki Sub onto our team.

886
01:07:39.604 --> 01:07:41.477
Tell me. What is it?

887
01:07:41.477 --> 01:07:45.155
I just wanted to see
if it was possible or not.

888
01:07:45.985 --> 01:07:48.485
To see if it was a picture
that could be drawn or not.

889
01:07:48.996 --> 01:07:51.376
What is this picture
you want to draw, anyway?

890
01:07:52.814 --> 01:07:54.320
A world where you can win.

891
01:07:56.881 --> 01:07:58.934
Eun Ji's mom, it's me.

892
01:07:58.934 --> 01:08:00.621
<i>What is this money, suddenly?</i>

893
01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:04.244
To tell you the truth, I got a job.

894
01:08:04.244 --> 01:08:06.818
I'm on the Strategic Planning team
at Gangsu Foods.

895
01:08:07.539 --> 01:08:12.102
I'm not a full-time employee,
but I have a contract position.

896
01:08:12.102 --> 01:08:14.634
<i>Dad, then you're not working
construction anymore?</i>

897
01:08:14.634 --> 01:08:16.140
Of course not.

898
01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.946
Dad is working in an office now.

899
01:08:18.946 --> 01:08:21.595
<i>Wow, then can I attend math academy?</i>

900
01:08:21.595 --> 01:08:23.512
<i>Dad, piano for me.</i>

901
01:08:23.512 --> 01:08:26.344
Of course, you girls can do all of that.

902
01:08:26.344 --> 01:08:30.339
I'll send you to all the places
you girls want to attend.

903
01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:31.696
All right.

904
01:08:33.967 --> 01:08:37.147
<i>Also, a place where
people like Mister Kim...</i>

905
01:08:38.246 --> 01:08:42.015
<i>and my friends like Joon can win.</i>

906
01:08:42.015 --> 01:08:43.228
Here.

907
01:09:03.371 --> 01:09:04.771
The pictures turned out well.

908
01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.140
Thank you.

909
01:09:09.539 --> 01:09:12.898
Do you think that's possible?

910
01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.747
Maybe.

911
01:09:19.485 --> 01:09:22.088
<i>Maybe, my friend.</i>

912
01:09:26.741 --> 01:09:33.741
