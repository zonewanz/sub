00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.200
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.910
I'm going to find a proper 
man since I'm single again.

3
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.150
I don't have a child like someone.

4
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.290
I think Yeon Ju will get remarried soon.

5
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.460
She doesn't have a child.

6
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.220
She's pretty, and she's rich.

7
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.560
Yeon Ju's mother will prepare 
a lot of men for her.

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.800
I wondered why you were so serious.

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.130
You were worrying about
 the most useless thing.

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.090
Buses and women who have left...

11
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.740
never look back.

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.260
Yeon Ju's not the only one 
who can meet new people.

13
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.580
I'll also prepare women to meet you.

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.810
I'm okay.

15
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.160
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.410
You're only 33 years old.

17
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.420
You're a doctor, and you're handsome.

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.850
Honestly, you're better than Yeon Ju...

19
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.590
because you take after me.

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.660
There's nothing to feel insecure about.

21
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.290
You might have a child,

22
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.970
but in my eyes, Han Gyul is pretty 
because she takes after me.

23
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.700
They say that looks are the most 
important thing in this society.

24
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.140
How lucky is a woman to have...

25
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.110
two good-looking people in her life?

26
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.810
Anyway, I will only focus 
on work for a while.

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.220
Okay, completely erase 
Ha Yeon Ju from your memory.

28
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.590
Both the mother and daughter are so rude.

29
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.320
They're probably celebrating
from getting a divorce.

30
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.240
I will forget tomorrow

31
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.050
I will put on a lot of lipstick

32
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.250
Love isn't for long

33
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.860
It's not for forever

34
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.500
It blooms in the morning

35
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.170
It shrivels in the afternoon

36
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.640
Yeon Ju, what are you doing? Listen to me singing.

37
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.030
Yeon Ju, what's wrong?

38
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.580
Mom, bring So Won to me.

39
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.750
I'm too upset and angry, I just can't send him like this.

40
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.160
Why is my heart broken when he's the one who did wrong?

41
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.700
Mom, I'm in so much pain.

42
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.100
Oh, my.

43
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.190
I didn't come here because I wanted to.

44
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.870
I came here to cheer you up, but I guess it's no use.

45
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.010
(House Rental Contract)

46
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.370
- Grandma. - Yes?

47
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.990
Grandpa is home.

48
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.720
Really?

49
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.730
Grandma, are we going to celebrate for Aunt Ru Ri?

50
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.060
Of course. Let's blow candles for her outside.

51
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.530
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

52
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.740
Congratulations.

53
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.690
I can't believe this.

54
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.840
My idiot daughter hit a home run.

55
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.310
So Won, as I told you before,

56
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.570
a divorce isn't a failure, it's another option.

57
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.720
It's the second part of your life and a trend.

58
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.540
Second-generation conglomerates, celebrities, and even...

59
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.440
the American president gets divorced these days.

60
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.380
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

61
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.300
In one word, it's a blessing. A blessing, I tell you.

62
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.600
Honey, are you serious?

63
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.190
Of course.

64
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.510
Even when a pair of shoes don't fit, they're uncomfortable.

65
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.270
Imagine if you and your spouse don't fit?

66
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.680
Separating quickly is the best solution if you're not well-suited.

67
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.050
Since you have said that to So Won today,

68
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.280
it made it easier for me to tell you this.

69
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.790
What do you want to tell us?

70
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.220
What is it? Tell me.

71
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.130
Lee Shin Mo.

72
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.000
Let's also get blessed.

73
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.940
Blessed? What kind of blessing?

74
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.170
The blessing where people who don't suit each other separate.

75
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.830
What?

76
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.130
What nonsense are you speaking of?

77
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.620
It's not nonsense.

78
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.920
I want a divorce.

79
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.430
You really disgust me now.

80
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.300
I'm not going to live with you.

81
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.720
What? What did you say?

82
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.500
I should've done this earlier, but I endured it because of So Won.

83
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.440
Since So Won's issue is done, let's arrange matters.

84
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.750
Wait a minute.

85
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.180
Young Hye, you have a disorder.

86
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.000
You periodically demand...

87
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.190
for divorces, marriage graduations, and separation.

88
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.630
Enough is enough.

89
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.750
I comforted you because I'm good-natured.

90
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.930
Do you think I'm enduring you because you're good to me?

91
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.320
That's why I want to end this.

92
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.740
End what?

93
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.240
- Dad. - It's okay.

94
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.440
You only know how to yell because you're ignorant.

95
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.280
If you're only going to yell, I don't want to talk to you anymore.

96
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.460
See you in court.

97
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.550
What? Wait a minute.

98
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.020
- Mom. - I can't believe this.

99
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.920
Did you see this?

100
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.140
Your mom just talked to me rudely.

101
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.630
Dad, please calm down.

102
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.510
Talk to her.

103
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.970
How can I talk to her?

104
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.670
She's so ignorant.

105
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.000
She's not educated at all.

106
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.070
How could she speak rudely to her husband?

107
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.940
Young Hye, come here.

108
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.310
It's an order.

109
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.010
- I can't believe this. - Dad.

110
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.610
So Won, what should we do?

111
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.320
Why is she doing this?

112
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.120
Why is she doing this today?

113
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.440
Father's already upset.

114
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.210
You can't say that.

115
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.640
Mom didn't do anything wrong.

116
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.440
She endured for so long.

117
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.080
Can you not fight?

118
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.200
I'm scared.

119
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.610
You'll forget everything tomorrow

120
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.640
Oh, my. What happened?

121
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.580
Why are police cars lined up?

122
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.810
Where?

123
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.320
I'm scared.

124
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.940
What happened to make so many police cars line up like that?

125
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.120
Mr. Kim, pull the car over there.

126
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.130
Excuse me? Mr. Staff of Justice.

127
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.890
Did an accident happen in this neighborhood?

128
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.260
Why are you all here in the middle of the night?

129
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.630
We missed a burglar who only steals from houses where only women live.

130
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.830
We're searching for him.

131
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.040
Oh, my goodness.

132
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.520
Why is there a burglar in this luxurious neighborhood?

133
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.700
Anyway, you're going through a lot of trouble.

134
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.370
We'll catch him soon. Don't worry.

135
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.550
Wait a minute.

136
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.640
It's a tip.

137
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.130
What are you doing? I'm not allowed to accept that.

138
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.860
Okay.

139
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.760
He doesn't want a tip.

140
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.500
Work hard.

141
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.820
- Mom. - Why?

142
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.450
It's a little spooky.

143
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.190
Don't worry. We installed a security system.

144
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.240
The police will come within one minute.

145
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.310
Security system? Okay, let's go.

146
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.630
I'm tired of this pattern.

147
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.120
Aren't you tired of this?

148
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.620
You always pack and unpack.

149
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.690
Does that entertain you?

150
00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.680
Okay. I don't know why you're upset,

151
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.770
but it's all my fault. Just stop it.

152
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.000
Do you think I'm just upset?

153
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.240
That's why you're not right for me.

154
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.010
What? Me?

155
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.110
Are you talking about me?

156
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.110
Yes, I'm talking about you.

157
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.200
You always talk to me rudely.

158
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.970
Why can't I talk rudely to you?

159
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.520
- Hong Young Hye. - Why. Lee Shin Mo?

160
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.760
- Mom. - Calm down.

161
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.360
Step aside. Don't move.

162
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.600
If you keep doing this, I'm really going to be mad.

163
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.600
You know how scary I am when I'm mad, don't you?

164
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.130
Don't wake a sleeping lion.

165
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.500
A lion? You must be kidding me.

166
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.370
- Hey. - Father.

167
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.610
Okay, I'm going to stop because of So Won.

168
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.910
Let's talk, since you like to talk so much.

169
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.250
What is wrong with you today?

170
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.390
I followed our divorced son all day...

171
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.170
encouraging him.

172
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.720
I got him a room and found him a hospital to work at.

173
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.260
All you did was lie down in a warm room.

174
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.500
You just enjoyed your time.

175
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.530
I worked so hard for our family,

176
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.400
my feet are sweating.

177
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.410
What did I do so wrong to get a divorce?

178
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.540
Do you want me to list from A to Z all the things you've done wrong?

179
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.560
Let's just quit it.

180
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.970
Even if you did know,

181
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.880
There's no prospect of you changing. So let's just forget about it.

182
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.200
We're getting a divorce anyway.

183
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.860
There's no good in exposing your shortcomings in front of our kids.

184
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.410
What I want is a clean break.

185
00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.730
Just do that for me.

186
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.600
Where do you think you're going? Stay here.

187
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.500
You must be misunderstanding something.

188
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.610
You must think that I'm not divorcing you...

189
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.460
because I like you or something.

190
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.930
No, never. Not even in the slightest.

191
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.330
I'm only trying to stop this divorce...

192
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.750
because I don't want to leave a blemish in my life.

193
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.250
Explain.

194
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.210
I can only agree on the divorce...

195
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.120
if I understand the reason for it.

196
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.790
Fine. Then listen carefully.

197
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.050
This is what you did to me while living with me...

198
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.700
for 34 years.

199
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.000
Lee Shin Mo.

200
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.410
Where did we go for our honeymoon?

201
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.740
Our honeymoon?

202
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.040
Was it Jeju Island?

203
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.850
No, was it Thailand?

204
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.570
No, we didn't go overseas at that time.

205
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.700
You wouldn't know where we went...

206
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.670
because you turned in your vacation days...

207
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.670
and went on a business trip with your boss to Jeju Island.

208
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.540
I only did so because I wanted to be successful, so I can...

209
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.280
- provide for our family. - When I gave birth to So Won...

210
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.630
and Ru Ri,

211
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.470
do you remember where you were?

212
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.660
I'm still sad that I couldn't be at the hospital...

213
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.760
when you went into labor.

214
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.560
However, thanks to my hard work, I was promoted very quickly.

215
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.030
We got to buy a house and a car.

216
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:25.350
You were absent when I was in labor,

217
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.430
but when your younger sister went into labor,

218
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.600
you bought flowers and ran to the hospital.

219
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.700
You have to understand. She's my only sister.

220
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.310
When my dad passed away,

221
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.080
you didn't even come because you couldn't leave your post in Busan.

222
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.110
I was trying to fix the accident that happened on the site.

223
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.050
But when your mother passed away,

224
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.630
you took a night flight from Dubai to come back!

225
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.900
Fine.

226
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.420
So what is your point?

227
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.540
This is who you are.

228
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.200
Only your parents are important.

229
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.780
You treated your parents-in-law with little or no respect.

230
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.030
These are the things you told me. "You know nothing."

231
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.070
"Kneel, and beg for forgiveness." "This is an order."

232
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.900
"You're stupid, so shut your mouth."

233
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.160
"Hey!" "You!"

234
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.480
Every day, you've been insulting your wife.

235
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.860
This isn't the end of it.

236
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.180
Every year, you had a medical checkup.

237
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.100
You only care about your health.

238
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.950
When I told you my back hurt...

239
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.590
after giving birth to Ru Ri for months,

240
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.370
you've never brought me so much as a single pain relief patch.

241
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.140
- Father. - Dad.

242
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.340
Hey.

243
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.510
It's because...

244
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.020
I believed in your mother's build.

245
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.650
Hey,

246
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.490
what about you? Have you done any work?

247
00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.680
Do you know the temperature in Saudi Arabia?

248
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.940
I had to suffer from the heat wave of temperature over 50°C.

249
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.810
My groin was covered with mold.

250
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.720
- That's how much I sweated. - Stop it.

251
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.530
That's enough. I'm sick of it.

252
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.290
You were busy trying to patronize me that you were the breadwinner.

253
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.190
You never once acknowledged my work at home.

254
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.490
You nagged me to spend less money...

255
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.330
and you made me keep a household ledger.

256
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:04.330
Why?

257
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.780
Were you keeping watch to see if I secretly gave money to my family?

258
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.290
Fine. Good job on providing for our family. I'll give you that.

259
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.360
However, to help you make a lot of money,

260
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.480
I did everything in my power to take care of you at home.

261
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.440
Have you ever thought about what I've done for you?

262
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.810
Did you think you could live your life...

263
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.270
without making money or taking care of me at home?

264
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.090
Shut it. I will no longer live with you...

265
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.060
for the sake of my daughter.

266
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.430
All you do is belittle Ru Ri...

267
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:35.960
hurt her self-esteem.

268
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.700
You call her stupid.

269
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.580
There's nothing stupid about Ru Ri.

270
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.040
In a nutshell,

271
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.840
for 34 years, you have ruined, trampled,

272
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.910
and brought misfortunes into my life.

273
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.180
You're a selfish, terrible husband and father.

274
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.360
You're no more or no less than that.

275
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.050
Are you done?

276
00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:57.480
Haven't you had enough?

277
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.670
Or do you want to hear more reasons of our divorce?

278
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.700
Okay. Fine. Let me entertain your claim.

279
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:09.710
Say that I'm a selfish, terrible father and husband.

280
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.030
This is what you said earlier.

281
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.120
You said that there's no chance that I'd change.

282
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.290
Okay. Why don't you keep claiming that?

283
00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.630
I'll show you the worst side of me.

284
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.560
Dad.

285
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.900
What? Divorce?

286
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.770
Over my dead body. I won't let you divorce me!

287
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.340
Is that so?

288
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.510
Fine. Let's go all the way and see who wins.

289
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.110
Mom, you should let it go.

290
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.000
Father has been going through a lot because of me.

291
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.070
Did you have to cause trouble now?

292
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:50.890
So Won, you can't say that.

293
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.800
Let's be honest here. Everything she said was true.

294
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.070
If he were my husband, I'd have divorced and left him long ago.

295
00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.210
Ru Ri. Are you adding fuel to the fire?

296
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.500
Be quiet.

297
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.730
Stop talking. Just leave me alone.

298
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.250
My goodness. What a great family.

299
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.020
Both the son and father are going to be divorced.

300
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.360
You must be trying to ruin my family.

301
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.360
Gosh. Unbelievable.

302
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.270
Put on the dark lipstick

303
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.150
Love is

304
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.740
Hey,

305
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.370
hey, we're home.

306
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.660
Mom, the maid went to her daughter house tonight.

307
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.080
Oh, my goodness. I forgot about that.

308
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.850
- But... - Yes?

309
00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.120
why...

310
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.120
are the lights turned on over there?

311
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.860
Mom, what's wrong with you? You're scaring me.

312
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.950
Yeon Ju, make a sweep.

313
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.320
My safe. My safe, my safe!

314
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.570
Okay.

315
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.750
The security system has been deactivated.

316
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

317
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.040
How many do I have in total? Hold on a minute.

318
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

319
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.270
What is...

320
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.150
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

321
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.410
Mom! Mom!

322
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.040
Yeon Ju!

323
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.330
Mom!

324
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.730
My gosh, what's going on?

325
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.060
Mom, look over there.

326
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.610
Over there.

327
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.720
There's... There's a thief?

328
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.440
What should we do? Whom do we call?

329
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.050
What do you mean? We need to call 114.

330
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:15.450
Mom, that's the number...

331
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.180
for information.

332
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.480
Then was it 113?

333
00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.320
113? Is that the right number?

334
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.550
I don't know. I'm so scared! I can't think straight.

335
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.260
Why would you be scared?

336
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.090
We need to stay focused in a crisis like this.

337
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.130
Yeon Ju, we need to prepare for the worst.

338
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.300
The passcode for the safe is 828282.

339
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.800
My PIN number for my accounts is 8282.

340
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.430
I lent 500,000 dollars...

341
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.170
to Ms. Park in Cheongdam-dong.

342
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.090
Just remember these.

343
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.030
Mom!

344
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.530
What should we do? Are you okay?

345
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.470
Wait. That's a familiar voice.

346
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.490
Mom, do you know thieves?

347
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.840
Why would I know thieves?

348
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.740
- My goodness. - You!

349
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.730
Ma'am, it's me. Gosh, this hurts.

350
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.210
Hey, you didn't go to your daughter's house?

351
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.030
I came back early.

352
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.630
Then why did you search my room and make a mess?

353
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.550
You wanted me to throw out your ex-husband's belongings.

354
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.110
You're so stupid. You should've let us know it was you.

355
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.260
Mom. Mom.

356
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.780
What was the passcode for your safe?

357
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.650
I'm going to change it now.

358
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.300
Let me see your forehead.

359
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.270
Some ointment will do.

360
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.240
My goodness.

361
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.260
- The passcode. - You're so dumb.

362
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.510
Get out.

363
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.430
This is uncomfortable. I'm so used to sleeping alone.

364
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.730
Do you have to sleep in my room?

365
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.750
It's hard to not notice an empty space.

366
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.990
Now that So Won isn't here, my bed feels too big.

367
00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.210
I'm scared that a thief might come in.

368
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.930
I feel lonely too.

369
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.760
Goodness. You've got to be kidding me.

370
00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.750
If you're lonely only after a day since your divorce.

371
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.850
I've been a widow for 30 years.

372
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.040
Then I must have died out of loneliness.

373
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.010
Even so. I'm still lonely.

374
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.010
Hold on.

375
00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.050
I just remembered...

376
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.820
a good way to cure your loneliness.

377
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.390
This?

378
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.920
Money?

379
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.690
Fun of having money.

380
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.610
My gosh.

381
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.290
Are you all right?

382
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.210
I'm all right. I'm sorry.

383
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.820
You should watch where you're going, young lady.

384
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.650
I'm sure that he goes to the same company as Tae Yang.

385
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.000
Here, it's a late-night snack.

386
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.670
Seeing as to how it's ramyeon again, things must still be bad, right?

387
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.690
I think we should save money and force them to have a wedding.

388
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.240
That won't solve anything.

389
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.980
I think the reason why Mom and Dad aren't getting along these days...

390
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.980
is because of this person.

391
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.320
So what are you going to do?

392
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.490
Let's secretly visit, and warn him.

393
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.760
Let's tell him to leave our family alone.

394
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.160
How will we find him?

395
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.710
If your grandmother finds out, it's uncomfortable,

396
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.130
and we can't ask Tae Yang.

397
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:34.500
Who are we going to ask?

398
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.210
There's just one person...

399
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.030
who will know about this man.

400
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.680
Who?

401
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.170
Joo Ae Ri, Tae Yang's rude girlfriend.

402
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.080
Do you know about SC Food and Beverage?

403
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.520
Kevin is the chairman of that company.

404
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:55.850
Tae Yang...

405
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.150
works there.

406
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.220
Just tell him about this.

407
00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.150
Joo Ae Ri made me do this.

408
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.090
She told me to change the poster.

409
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.400
What is this?

410
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.470
Who are you?

411
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.740
Who hired you?

412
00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.710
Tell me before I report you to the police.

413
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.910
Who is it?

414
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.350
Why are you alone? Where's Dad?

415
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.420
Oh, are you just getting home?

416
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.660
Here.

417
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.730
What is this?

418
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.430
I heard from Eun Byul...

419
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.730
that Dad wasn't hired as a full-time professor again.

420
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.740
I'm going to give you more money starting from this month.

421
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.570
You can't afford it.

422
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.740
Don't worry.

423
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.930
Did anything happen at work these days?

424
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.420
I already told you. The chairman really likes me.

425
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.290
He's a lonely man, so I want to be nice to him like a father.

426
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.690
Like a father?

427
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.560
Honestly, Dad isn't really older than me, so he's like a friend.

428
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.900
If my birth father was alive,

429
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.070
I wish he was someone like the chairman.

430
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.570
Do you like him that much?

431
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.940
More than that, I feel like I'm connected to him with fate.

432
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.280
Didn't I tell you that I helped a Korean-American in Bali?

433
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.450
You made food for him when he was suffering from dengue fever.

434
00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.860
It can't be.

435
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.780
Was he that person?

436
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.000
Yes. Isn't that surprising?

437
00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.770
We must have a special bond.

438
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.440
Why?

439
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.810
Are you uncomfortable because I keep talking about my birth father?

440
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.450
No, I'm not uncomfortable.

441
00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.750
You...

442
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.070
will continue working there, right?

443
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.220
Of course.

444
00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.140
I'm the most quickly promoted team manager.

445
00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.990
I'm the rising star of the company.

446
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.690
My job is rewarding.

447
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.730
I need to go wash up.

448
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.000
Tae Yang.

449
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.460
Let me ask you something.

450
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:04.340
If your birth father was alive,

451
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.710
would you meet him?

452
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.180
Mom.

453
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.980
It's not reality but just a hypothesis.

454
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.090
He made my life unhappy.

455
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.150
But if he was successful...

456
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.590
and able to help you...

457
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.530
What about you?

458
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.800
I'm okay. Tell me the truth.

459
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.900
I'd...

460
00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.070
rather die than see...

461
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.640
you being involved with him.

462
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.980
Then I don't want to meet him either.

463
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.050
Really?

464
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.450
I don't know what happened between you and him in the past.

465
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.490
But you never mentioned him throughout my life.

466
00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.490
I can imagine what kind of person he was like.

467
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.130
If he was that terrible, no matter how successful he is,

468
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.760
I don't want to meet him.

469
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:03.730
That's my answer.

470
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.540
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

471
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.510
I was...

472
00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.170
just curious.

473
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.850
What happened to the investigation?

474
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.180
According to Jung Hwa Young's family relationship documents,

475
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.130
she only has one son named Kim Woo Joo.

476
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.820
What are you talking about? She has a son and a daughter.

477
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.490
She seems to be the daughter of Go Jung Do, the man she lives with.

478
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.460
They didn't register their marriage. They're only living together.

479
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.730
Does my son doesn't exist in this world?

480
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.200
Did Sarah talk nonsense?

481
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.640
The family must have cooperated in hiding him.

482
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.090
I asked the neighborhood,

483
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.680
and they said that a young man also lived with them.

484
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.780
Really?

485
00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.920
I told them to investigate him. We'll find out who he is.

486
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.300
It's me.

487
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.000
I need to see you today.

488
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.240
Okay, I'll go there.

489
00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.240
Why is she asking to see me first?

490
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.670
Are you done working out?

491
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.270
You must be going somewhere in the middle of the night.

492
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.170
Yes, I have a new student. I'm going to teach a lesson.

493
00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:00.650
Honey,

494
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.250
do you have something to tell me?

495
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.090
What? No, I don't.

496
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.090
Really?

497
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:11.490
Okay.

498
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.730
It's cold outside. Call me when it's over.

499
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.070
I'll pick you up.

500
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.200
It's okay. I'll be a little late.

501
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.540
Go to bed first.

502
00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.920
I'm almost there. Should I wait in front of your house?

503
00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.650
No, it's dangerous.

504
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.990
I'll send you an address. Come there.

505
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.260
Okay.

506
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.470
Her sister visited Kevin at the company.

507
00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.790
Jung Hwa Young will find out in a few days...

508
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.340
that Kevin is the birth father of Tae Yang.

509
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.220
(To Chairman Kevin Miller of SC Food and Beverage)

510
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.300
Why isn't she coming home?

511
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.510
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

512
00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.280
Is she still in class?

513
00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.490
I thought she had a class. Why is she out here?

514
00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.410
Who is that?

515
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.750
No way.

516
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.480
Why did you ask to see me so suddenly?

517
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.200
Seeing as you called me in the middle of the night,

518
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.780
this must be urgent.

519
00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:55.950
Listen carefully.

520
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.020
This will be the first and last time...

521
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.790
that I ask you to see me.

522
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.230
And maybe, this will be...

523
00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.700
the last thing that I ask of you.

524
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.930
You must have met Sarah.

525
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.430
Yes.

526
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.600
I heard everything from her.

527
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.140
She told me that you changed your name to Kevin...

528
00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.470
and that you are the chairman of SC Food and Beverage.

529
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:22.910
Good.

530
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.850
I wanted you to find out.

531
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.750
You reacted faster than I expected.

532
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.990
I'll tell you...

533
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.820
the truth today.

534
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.480
In turn, just promise me one thing.

535
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.680
What?

536
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.800
As soon as you hear me out, you need to grant...

537
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.450
my last wish.

538
00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:46.600
I...

539
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.340
will decide after I hear you out.

540
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.940
If that's how you're going to be, I have nothing to say.

541
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.310
All right.

542
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.080
I promise.

543
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.220
Tell me.

544
00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.750
What is the truth that you have to tell me?

545
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.330
You said you saw baby clothes in my luggage.

546
00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:15.030
Yes.

547
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.530
Yes.

548
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.070
You were right.

549
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.500
What you had wished for...

550
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.200
is true.

551
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.010
That means...

552
00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.010
That means...

553
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:34.350
Does that mean my son...

554
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.280
My son exists?

555
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.720
After what happened in Seattle,

556
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.360
I ran away to my sister's house.

557
00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.060
I thought you were dead, so I wanted to die with you.

558
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.100
But then...

559
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.570
I found out that I was pregnant.

560
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.600
So I couldn't die,

561
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.260
and I had to live until now.

562
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:01.980
My son... Where is my son?

563
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.740
No, I mean... What's he like?

564
00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.980
Does he take after you or me?

565
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.750
No, that's not it.

566
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.440
What's his name?

567
00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.990
What is he doing right now?

568
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.690
I wasn't rich, but I brought him up well.

569
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.530
He's kind, diligent, talented,

570
00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.030
and warm.

571
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.690
Does he know about me too?

572
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:30.840
No.

573
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.510
I didn't want to tell him.

574
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.040
I want to keep it that way.

575
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.750
That's the last thing I want to ask of you.

576
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:40.750
You know that he's alive.

577
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.220
He's living well without you.

578
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.200
Don't look into him.

579
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.990
- Anna. - I know.

580
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.460
I know that it won't be easy.

581
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.530
I know that you've changed too. But...

582
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.500
But I'm really happy right now.

583
00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:58.100
It was really hard for me become happy.

584
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.250
But I don't want you...

585
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.190
to intervene and ruin my family's happiness.

586
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.310
I want to end my relationship with you if that means I can...

587
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:09.940
protect my happiness.

588
00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.050
I don't mean to ruin your family's happiness.

589
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.220
I'll be good.

590
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:18.170
I'll pay back for everything I have done wrong.

591
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.970
You don't need to tell him who I am.

592
00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:24.120
Just let me watch from faraway...

593
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.790
and help him.

594
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.280
I'll just do that.

595
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.760
I told you.

596
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.350
My last wish...

597
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.100
is that you'll just pretend not to know us both.

598
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.700
And my son...

599
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.010
doesn't want to know about his father.

600
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:45.310
That's why I asked you to come here.

601
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.680
Please, I implore you.

602
00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:51.850
In that case,

603
00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.120
do me a favor too.

604
00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:01.160
Just show me what he looks like.

605
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.000
If that's too hard, just tell me his name.

606
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.500
That's not too much.

607
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:07.970
Please.

608
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.140
I told you.

609
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.110
My son doesn't want you.

610
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.750
Do you think I won't find out?

611
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.860
If I hire people to look for him,

612
00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.620
I'll find him in no time.

613
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.970
I'll do that.

614
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.520
No, I'm already doing it.

615
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.260
All right.

616
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.660
I knew you would.

617
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.090
Even if I try to hide him,

618
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.050
you'll find him eventually.

619
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.970
Just remember what I said when you do.

620
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.370
If you tell him that you're his father,

621
00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.360
you'll lose him forever.

622
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.960
So even if you find out about him,

623
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.380
just ignore him.

624
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.350
That's the only way to protect him.

625
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.200
(To Chairman Kevin of SC Food and Beverage)

626
00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.690
You're nothing compared to Chairman Kevin.

627
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.090
Do you need me to tell you this?

628
00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.830
Who do you think would win...

629
00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.850
if a part-time lecturer fights with a millionaire?

630
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.550
You made coffee.

631
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:48.700
Give it to me.

632
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.470
What are you doing?

633
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:55.540
I told you to give me a cup of coffee.

634
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:59.250
Did you forget? We're going to get divorced soon.

635
00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.520
You should make food for yourself now.

636
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.790
So she's going to act up like this?

637
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.240
Gosh, I can't believe that woman.

638
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.560
Gosh.

639
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.160
Are you all right, Father?

640
00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.730
It seems like you didn't sleep well last night.

641
00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.220
Why wouldn't I sleep well?

642
00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.890
You don't need to listen to someone who talks nonsense.

643
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:29.090
No, I think Mom really means it this time.

644
00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.940
Don't worry.

645
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.260
Your mom might talk about it,

646
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.030
but she can't dare act it out.

647
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.740
She can't make decisions, nor is she talented enough.

648
00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.290
What is she going to do when we get divorced?

649
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.280
She lives in a big house and drives a car...

650
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.800
all thanks to me.

651
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.170
What would happen if she leaves the house?

652
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.390
She knows well enough that she'll have a hard time.

653
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.700
Don't say things like that. You should try to console her.

654
00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.910
She's been stressed out because of me.

655
00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.680
You should go on a trip and try to persuade her.

656
00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.530
Wait,

657
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.220
it has been a while since she's been on a trip.

658
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.170
Yes, that's right.

659
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.410
Women need to get some fresh air...

660
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:17.720
so that they won't complain.

661
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.060
Yes, that's why she's mad.

662
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.330
She's been talking about the honeymoon...

663
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.050
which has been over 34 years.

664
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.600
Right? That must be it.

665
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.140
(House Lend-Lease Contract)

666
00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.480
You already got a house?

667
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.510
Yes.

668
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.690
What is it? Are you upset?

669
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.460
No.

670
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.030
If you are happy now,

671
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:55.660
that's enough for me.

672
00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:02.030
But will Dad agree to a divorce so easily?

673
00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.710
Even if it means I need to fight him,

674
00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.310
I will make him sign the contract.

675
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.450
So this is what happens to our family in the end.

676
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.950
There must be no love in the world that lasts forever.

677
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.560
Ru Ri.

678
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:31.430
I'm sorry you had to see this.

679
00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.650
Mom.

680
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:37.240
It's wrong to endure life when you know it's wrong.

681
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.360
But you shouldn't try to stop yourself from loving someone...

682
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.740
just because you're afraid to become like me.

683
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.350
If you really have someone that you love,

684
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.180
you have to be honest.

685
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.970
You need to stand strong and say what's wrong.

686
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.520
You must act without hesitation for what's right.

687
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:58.160
I couldn't do that. That's how I ended up here.

688
00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.030
You know that, right?

689
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.870
I honestly...

690
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:10.840
didn't know what to do...

691
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.040
with Manager Jung.

692
00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:15.480
Is something wrong?

693
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.810
But... Never mind.

694
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:24.680
After I listened to you, I feel brave now.

695
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.890
I'll be honest with how I feel now.

696
00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:30.060
Okay.

697
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.330
Even after the divorce,

698
00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:35.700
I'll always be on your side.

699
00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.830
Tell me if you have any problems, okay?

700
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:42.870
Okay.

701
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.810
Joo Ae Ri told me to do it.

702
00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.810
She told me to switch the new menu poster.

703
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.520
Is this why you came here? To show me this?

704
00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.090
You didn't call or come to work after causing trouble.

705
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.520
Do you think hiding would solve everything?

706
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.130
How can you laugh?

707
00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:12.000
An innocent person is getting fired because of what you did.

708
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:14.600
You have to take responsibility.

709
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.830
I tried to understand you because of what the chairman said...

710
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.010
and because you're in my team,

711
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.510
but if you keep doing this, I can't work with you.

712
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.850
Since you acknowledged it, I'll follow the company rule.

713
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.730
I'm disappointed.

714
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.660
You're not as honest as I thought.

715
00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:52.140
I've confessed my heart. It's your turn now.

716
00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.810
Acknowledge it even if you don't want to.

717
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.080
You'll feel better then.

718
00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.410
What's my heart?

719
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.680
That you're very thankful to me.

720
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.350
Thanks to me, you can avoid seeing Lee Ru Ri.

721
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:10.490
You act like you're just and innocent,

722
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.110
but you actually want to dump your useless girlfriend,

723
00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.700
and become a son-in-law of SC Food and Beverage.

724
00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.330
Isn't that right?

725
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.670
Are you saying you got rid of Lee Ru Ri for me?

726
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.140
That won't make you feel guilty,

727
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.140
and I can protect my love.

728
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.910
We both got what we want.

729
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.310
So just ignore that stupid video.

730
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.080
It'll end everything.

731
00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.120
I heard you're not supposed to fix the person.

732
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.560
You're incurable.

733
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:50.830
I'm sending this video to the director, so keep that in mind.

734
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.500
Also, if you ever get your hands on Lee Ru Ri,

735
00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:00.870
I'll report everything you did to the chairman, so be prepared.

736
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:05.750
If you really loved Lee Ru Ri,

737
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.750
why would you keep your relationship in secret to my dad?

738
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.370
You had so many chances to tell him the truth.

739
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.390
Why did you hide it?

740
00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.270
Do you want me to tell you...

741
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.200
what you're really after?

742
00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:35.370
The way to be more comfortable with our relationship.

743
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:49.120
Let me just say this.

744
00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.290
For the first time,

745
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.830
I feel pity for you.

746
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.430
If you don't respect yourself,

747
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.470
no one else will.

748
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.840
So stop reaching the bottom,

749
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:06.870
and learn to love yourself first.

750
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.550
You don't know anything to say that!

751
00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:18.620
Jerk.

752
00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:37.770
(Director Park)

753
00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.910
It's Jung Tae Yang.

754
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.540
I have something to tell you.

755
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:59.890
Now that you're not working, you just sleep all day.

756
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:02.700
You have a guest. Are you going to continue sleeping?

757
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.870
Yeon Ju. How did you get here?

758
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.310
Be quiet. Father might hear.

759
00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:16.910
I sneaked in because I missed you.

760
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:19.310
- Really? - Yes.

761
00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:25.400
Yeon Ju.

762
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.390
Did you miss me?

763
00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.330
Dad. I'm hungry. Let's have lunch.

764
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.940
My gosh. Honey. Are you okay?

765
00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.370
My goodness.

766
00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:49.140
Let me see. Are you okay?

767
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:51.080
Honey.

768
00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.630
Yeon Ju.

769
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.450
Yes. I'm here.

770
00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:59.350
Dad. Are you okay? Dad.

771
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:00.520
Yeon Ju.

772
00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.890
Dad. Are you okay? Dad.

773
00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.330
Yeon Ju.

774
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.970
Yeon Ju? She won't come here anymore.

775
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.390
What about this?

776
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:42.850
Yeon Ju's in there.

777
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:47.170
Whenever I missed you, I looked at a picture too.

778
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.870
Then we're together.

779
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:53.910
I'm fine.

780
00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:58.280
All I need is you.

781
00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:04.020
What are you doing?

782
00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.520
It shows you're a jobless single daddy.

783
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.460
Why would you be still in bed?

784
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:11.960
Get ready, and follow me.

785
00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.430
I'm just tired after the divorce.

786
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.830
Where are we going?

787
00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.270
I got the loan. We should sign a contract for hospital.

788
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.840
Father. I'll take care of myself.

789
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.820
Please focus on Mom.

790
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.910
How do you expect me to focus on her without seeing her?

791
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.090
She's so bold.

792
00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:32.410
She went out. She didn't even cook.

793
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.560
I spent so much in the wedding photo.

794
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.430
It's such a waste.

795
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.410
I fell for the look of him in the gown.

796
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:09.450
What a swindler.

797
00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.560
Why am I still wearing this?

798
00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.430
Stop.

799
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:27.200
What are you doing? Is that your ring?

800
00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.050
Do you have any idea how expensive this is?

801
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:31.740
Money's not the point here.

802
00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.910
I'm going to burn everything about him.

803
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.260
Then you do inside this grill.

804
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.260
He touched you the most.

805
00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.300
Mom!

806
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.250
Come on. Get a grip.

807
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:46.720
This won't help you get over him.

808
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:50.160
Get ready, and follow me.

809
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:52.520
I'll help you get over lovesickness.

810
00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.960
I've never seen a place like this in my 20 years as a building manager.

811
00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.830
Apartment in the back. Subway station in the front.

812
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:46.700
It's full of floating population.

813
00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:47.810
Look.

814
00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:50.570
It's the hot place of Gangbuk.

815
00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:52.750
Look.

816
00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.070
I've never seen a place like this in my 20 years as a building manager.

817
00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.840
Apartment in the back. Subway station in the front.

818
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.750
It's full of floating population.

819
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:05.210
Look. This is the hot place of Gangbuk.

820
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.330
Stop.

821
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.200
You can't fool me.

822
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:12.420
I own buildings in Chungdam.

823
00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.970
And I'm the president of the I love leasing club.

824
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.040
What do you think, Yeon Ju? Do you like it?

825
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.960
You kept telling me to make money,

826
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.460
so you want me to sell clothes?

827
00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.850
If you sit around and do nothing, you'll only get weird thoughts.

828
00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.970
You need to be so busy that you won't be...

829
00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:29.940
able to think about anything.

830
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.840
You're crazy about clothes.

831
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.840
You can choose what you want to sell.

832
00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.050
You can wear anything and sell anything.

833
00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.420
You can work hard and live your best.

834
00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.100
You can become a Korea woman.

835
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.060
A Korea woman? I'm Korean.

836
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:50.530
I want you to work really hard...

837
00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:53.850
and be a Korea woman.

838
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.250
Mom, you mean to say career woman.

839
00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:00.670
Career woman?

840
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.520
I can't speak as well as someone who's been abroad.

841
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:07.260
Well, anyway, I won't be bored.

842
00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:10.280
The second floor seems to be vacant.

843
00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.380
Is it going to stay that way?

844
00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:12.610
Luckily,

845
00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:15.200
I signed a contract today to a hospital.

846
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.820
With a doctor?

847
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.860
Yes. The doctor was really young and handsome.

848
00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:21.510
He's really handsome.

849
00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:25.180
We don't like doctors.

850
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.180
No doctors.

851
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:30.170
The first floor seems to be vacant.

852
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:31.700
Don't worry. Don't worry.

853
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.350
A big clothes shop will open next week.

854
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.240
Oh, my. That sounds nice.

855
00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.830
When people come shopping, they can visit the hospital too.

856
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:43.280
It's going to be managed by a young woman.

857
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.780
Her mother seems to be a really rich woman from Gangnam.

858
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.690
What was it that she said? Yes, she's a building woman.

859
00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:51.040
Really?

860
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.910
Is the young woman pretty?

861
00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:57.680
She's really tall. She's like a Miss Korea.

862
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.630
So Won, I told you.

863
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:04.320
The world is really big, and you can always meet new people.

864
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.890
I don't know why, but I felt like choosing this building.

865
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.390
Gosh.

866
00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.660
Father.

867
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:19.870
The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.

868
00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.970
Hey, didn't you meet Manager Jung yet?

869
00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:30.280
I told you. He's probably with Joo Ae Ri.

870
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:35.910
He's working at the restaurant today, right?

871
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.580
Are you going to meet him there?

872
00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.520
Mom told me...

873
00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.340
that when I find someone I love,

874
00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.760
I shouldn't hesitate and just be honest.

875
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.000
I need to go and see him...

876
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.060
to find out about his feelings.

877
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.600
I need to check if he's really...

878
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.640
into Joo Ae Ri.

879
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:15.290
The target is moving. The plan is a go.

880
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.530
I hope you don't make mistakes today.

881
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:24.500
- Yes. Don't worry. - Don't worry.

882
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.270
Hey.

883
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.820
You look really serious.

884
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.140
Will you end it if he says so?

885
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:36.640
Of course not.

886
00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.460
If I had misunderstood him, I'll get it straight again.

887
00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:40.750
But if it's true,

888
00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.520
I will be the one to end it.

889
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:47.620
Stop!

890
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:48.970
What is that?

891
00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.840
He went into the restaurant. Let's go.

892
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.990
- What? Why? - Hurry.

893
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.550
I'm the police. I need to see your ID card.

894
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:01.550
- What is this? - What is this?

895
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:03.420
- I heard a runaway soldier is here. - A runaway soldier?

896
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.720
- A runaway soldier? - Please cooperate.

897
00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.760
They say a runaway soldier came here.

898
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.090
- A runaway soldier? - Yes.

899
00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:09.810
- I don't know. - Detective Park, it's this way.

900
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:12.910
- Gosh. - Gosh.

901
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.420
Gosh.

902
00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:53.790
Do you know

903
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:57.120
That whenever I see you

904
00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.760
My heart beats

905
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:04.100
You don't know

906
00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:09.630
When the wind blows

907
00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:16.310
Will it bring your heart to me?

908
00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:20.900
Can I rest

909
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.970
In your heart?

910
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:26.800
Even just for a while

911
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.890
Ru Ri.

912
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.990
I'm sorry I upset you because of a misunderstanding.

913
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:34.430
Looking back, you always made me laugh,

914
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:36.430
but I never did.

915
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:42.070
From now on, I will never let you be lonely.

916
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:46.100
And until the day I die while holding your hand,

917
00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.670
I will love you more tomorrow than I did today.

918
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.020
Gosh, I thought you were really into Joo Ae Ri.

919
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:06.530
I'm sorry too for not trusting you.

920
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:10.930
From now on, I won't ever falter...

921
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.430
whatever happens.

922
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:27.950
Will you marry me?

923
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.870
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

924
00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:57.140
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

925
00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:59.280
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

926
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.890
Congratulations.

927
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.830
Thank you.

928
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:27.060
Can I rest

929
00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.230
In your heart?

930
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:34.260
Even just for a while

931
00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:37.420
Look at me

932
00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:41.900
I only look at you

933
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:45.160
Even if I'm hurt

934
00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:09.100
Mom.

935
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.350
Yes? What?

936
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.660
What's this?

937
00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.390
Yesterday,

938
00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:25.160
Manager Jung proposed to me.

939
00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:31.600
I'm sorry.

940
00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:36.270
Our family is in a mess.

941
00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.280
This is such a bad time.

942
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:42.850
Have you decided?

943
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.220
When I'm with him,

944
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:50.290
I think I can be happy.

945
00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.800
Mom.

946
00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:00.000
He's a good person.

947
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:04.970
He has a complicated family background,

948
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.240
but he's responsible and kind.

949
00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:13.400
If you just open up your mind a little...

950
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.550
It's not because I don't like him.

951
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.470
I'm just proud of you and sad at the same time...

952
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:23.360
to see you all grown up like this.

953
00:59:24.690 --> 00:59:25.890
Mom.

954
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.200
I'm worried too.

955
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.970
I felt like that with your father.

956
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.050
I thought that I could be...

957
00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:39.870
happy forever if I was with him.

958
00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.240
All right.

959
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.850
If you made up your mind, I have no intention of going against it.

960
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:54.190
I don't know when you'll get married,

961
00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:56.790
but take a close look.

962
00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.830
See if he's really worth living together for your life.

963
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.850
I'll take care of myself,

964
01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:08.670
so you won't have to worry about me.

965
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.310
I don't like jjajangmyeon.

966
01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:22.650
What? Why not?

967
01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:24.800
Now. Finish it.

968
01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.350
Here's radish.

969
01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:29.850
I ate it yesterday too.

970
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.610
Right, Father. Don't we have rice?

971
01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.560
Hey. How would I know?

972
01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.800
Your mom's gone insane.

973
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.880
She didn't even come home last night.

974
01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.670
What? Where did she sleep then?

975
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.300
Grandmother took blankets with her.

976
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.610
What? Blankets?

977
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:53.450
She should leave with nothing. Why would she take the blankets?

978
01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.030
Is she really going to get a divorce?

979
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:58.520
She can't get a divorce alone.

980
01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.790
No matter how hard she tries, she can't do anything if I say no.

981
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:12.560
Hey. What's up?

982
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:15.470
Now?

983
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.770
Okay.

984
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:24.740
Why does she want to see me all of a sudden?

985
01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.350
(Attorney Cha Jung Ok)

986
01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:43.900
Welcome. It's been five years since I saw you last.

987
01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.260
Hey, Cha Jung Ok.

988
01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.150
You've gotten so old.

989
01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:53.040
Your face is so wrinkly that I can even jump rope.

990
01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:54.540
Like this.

991
01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:56.510
So it was true.

992
01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.190
You don't watch your mouth.

993
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:59.860
Stop kidding.

994
01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.850
I'm your senior whom you haven't seen in ages.

995
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.850
I actually had something to tell you.

996
01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:11.410
You know my son, So Won?

997
01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:12.790
He's the best bachelor.

998
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:17.930
He divorced for an unavoidable reason.

999
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.100
If you see any good attorneys...

1000
01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.270
Let's talk about that later.

1001
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.410
I didn't call you as your junior.

1002
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:30.140
What? What are you talking about?

1003
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:32.280
Then why did you call me?

1004
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.680
Hong Young Hye's attorney.

1005
01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.270
You choose.

1006
01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.640
Do you want to agree on it or go through a trial?

1007
01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:18.290
(Man Who Sets the Table)

1008
01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.110
My goodness. The worst place at the worst time.

1009
01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:23.510
What are you doing here?

1010
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:25.850
- Let's go somewhere else. - No. I'm hungry.

1011
01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:28.050
I don't even want to talk to you. I'll see you at the court.

1012
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:30.490
Please give me one last chance.

1013
01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:32.920
Grandma. Grandpa loves you.

1014
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.820
You're just saying that.

1015
01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.060
You can always rely on me.

1016
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.490
Please take good care of me.

1017
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.630
What are you doing at my daughter's work?

1018
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:41.900
You stalker.

1019
01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.800
Tell Jung Tae Yang what his mom did in the US.

1020
01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.040
If you keep staying quiet, Kevin will take Jung Hwa Young.

1021
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.110
We're looking for someone. I was wondering if you know him.

1022
01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:52.170
My dad's ex?

1023
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:54.110
Is the son he's looking for...

1024
01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:56.930
Jung Tae Yang, that kid, is my son?
