71

has given me the promotion.

Hey, Pil Joo.

76

77
00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:26.436

Yeo Cheon's promotion?

92
00:08:30.436 --> 00:08:33.137
I didn't order it. I simply suggested the idea.

93
00:08:33.637 --> 00:08:36.877
There wasn't any update after you went hiking with Congressman Na.

95
00:08:38.676 --> 00:08:41.176
After the talk you and I had, I keep dreaming...

96
00:08:41.316 --> 00:08:43.186
about Cheong A Tower every other day.

97
00:08:44.387 --> 00:08:47.686
I woke up from having a dream about the very tower today.

98
00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:50.357
That's certainly a good dream to have.

99
00:08:52.027 --> 00:08:53.597
Grandfather, it's about my marriage.

100
00:08:54.157 --> 00:08:56.566
It's going according to our plan. You don't need to worry.

101
00:08:57.627 --> 00:08:58.696

- if Yeo Cheon gets promoted... - Chairman Jang.

103

If he's going to be the assistant manager of Strategy Team,

104
00:09:04.407 --> 00:09:05.877
qualifications of a vice president are needed for the position.

105
00:09:05.877 --> 00:09:07.706
First off, I'll make him an executive first.

106
00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:09.546
Given how he handles his duty,

107
00:09:09.576 --> 00:09:10.877
as long as he's competent,

108
00:09:11.347 --> 00:09:12.647
I can make him a vice president as well.

109
00:09:12.647 --> 00:09:14.017
Grandfather, that's absurd.

110
00:09:14.017 --> 00:09:16.046
I'll make decisions however I see fit.

Pil Joo, don't you worry.

115
00:09:35.836 --> 00:09:37.107
I'll take care of everything.

116
00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:38.637
Hey, I don't even need a fortnight.

117
00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:40.836
I'm going to tell her everything today,

118
00:09:41.007 --> 00:09:42.607
and I'll bring her over to Mooshimwon tomorrow morning.

119

- Why aren't you answering? - I'll empty my office...

when your transfer is officially approved.

Take her home before she passes out.

147

before he did, he wouldn't be of use anyway.

151
00:12:48.696 --> 00:12:50.227
I don't think I can be of any help.

152
00:12:59.507 --> 00:13:01.477
You need to look at the big picture.

153

Boo Cheon and Yeo Cheon...

154
00:13:03.977 --> 00:13:05.546
shouldn't be given nice positions...

No one knows how far they can go if they are not tough enough.

158
00:13:12.257 --> 00:13:14.086
Two of them must compete as much as they can...

to toughen them out. That's how they can survive.

- Father. - Yes.

161

When his dad was transferred to the hospital after losing consciousness,

162
00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:26.066
you wanted him off the oxygen mask.

163
00:13:27.296 --> 00:13:30.166
What? Who said such nonsense?

164
00:13:30.536 --> 00:13:32.806
Hadn't we pulled out life support, and watched for progress,

165
00:13:33.407 --> 00:13:35.446
he could have woken up.

the chance of Soo Man waking up was very slim.

168
00:13:40.147 --> 00:13:42.946
He wasn't just some guy. He was known for his strength.

169
00:13:43.517 --> 00:13:46.757
Why would I want to see him barely breathing with the oxygen tank?

170
00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.257
He will be only fodder for gossip for those...

171
00:13:50.286 --> 00:13:51.997
who find happiness in others' misfortune.

172
00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:53.397
As long as he was breathing,

173
00:13:54.497 --> 00:13:57.497
having a father would've been better for Boo Cheon than having no one.

174
00:13:58.566 --> 00:14:01.597
You give up on your son's life without giving it another thought...

175
00:14:01.597 --> 00:14:03.637
if Cheong A Group doesn't benefit from him.

176
00:14:03.806 --> 00:14:07.536
Let me tell you this since it seems you know a lot about me.

177
00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:11.176
Give Yeo Cheon the house if there's no chance...

178
00:14:11.607 --> 00:14:13.816
of Cheong A Tower getting built.

179
00:14:14.877 --> 00:14:15.887
Father.

180
00:14:17.216 --> 00:14:18.517
Half of Cheong A Group was built...

181
00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:21.517
- on the backs of my family. - What?

182
00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:24.056
What kind of nonsense is that?

183
00:14:24.056 --> 00:14:25.696
When Cheong A Group was suffering financially,

184
00:14:25.727 --> 00:14:28.796
thanks to the loans from my father who stuck his neck out for us,

185
00:14:28.796 --> 00:14:30.027
Cheong A managed to stay afloat.

186
00:14:30.027 --> 00:14:32.397
Hey, that wasn't his money.

187
00:14:32.737 --> 00:14:34.436
The money came from the bank and government.

188
00:14:34.536 --> 00:14:37.666
You wanted to use my father's ability to move the fund around.

189
00:14:37.737 --> 00:14:39.336
That's why you wanted me as your daughter-in-law.

190
00:14:40.176 --> 00:14:41.176
Don't...

191
00:14:42.076 --> 00:14:44.706
dismiss me so easily, Father.

192
00:14:49.816 --> 00:14:53.357
I didn't speak my mind as I felt sorry for you.

193
00:14:53.916 --> 00:14:55.286
Let me give you a piece of mind...

194
00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:57.127
since we are discussing this.

195
00:14:58.086 --> 00:15:01.056
You're the cause of Soo Man's collapse.

196
00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:03.826
It's because you're strong-headed.

197
00:15:03.897 --> 00:15:05.997
You exhausted my son, and therefore, he collapsed.

198
00:15:06.466 --> 00:15:08.036
You should be repenting!

199
00:16:13.237 --> 00:16:15.107
Dr. Hong came to treat you.

200
00:16:19.036 --> 00:16:20.237
When I woke up,

201
00:16:21.576 --> 00:16:24.007
I was nervous if I wasn't at home.

202
00:16:25.946 --> 00:16:27.216
I was afraid that...

203
00:16:28.647 --> 00:16:30.617
people from Mooshimwon might have seen my weak side.

204
00:17:01.847 --> 00:17:02.946
What is it?

205
00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:31.377
Na Mo Hyun...

206
00:17:32.817 --> 00:17:34.416
found out Boo Cheon's identity.

207
00:17:45.057 --> 00:17:46.756
I shouldn't have let...

208
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:51.897
that foolish girl who cared about fate and love influence me.

209
00:17:51.897 --> 00:17:53.236
It's my fault.

210
00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:58.037
I should have intervened more closely.

211
00:17:59.137 --> 00:18:01.637
It would have been better if they met on a blind date.

212
00:18:02.946 --> 00:18:05.147
She would have accepted his proposal after refusing...

213
00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:06.746
his hands a few times.

214
00:18:06.847 --> 00:18:08.817
It would have been impossible...

215
00:18:10.617 --> 00:18:12.016
to have her to show up on the date.

216
00:18:12.787 --> 00:18:15.157
Where is the Kang Pil Joo that I know of?

217
00:18:15.226 --> 00:18:18.526
Why do you sound like you're her spokesperson?

218
00:18:18.926 --> 00:18:19.956
You...

219
00:18:35.176 --> 00:18:36.246
Pil Joo.

220
00:18:38.006 --> 00:18:40.016
We can't give up yet.

221
00:18:41.547 --> 00:18:42.617
This marriage...

222
00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:45.716
is for your benefit too.

223
00:18:55.867 --> 00:18:57.026
Chairman Jang.

224
00:18:57.926 --> 00:18:59.897
Why do you hate Director Jang Boo Cheon so much...

225
00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:03.067
even though he's your eldest grandson?

226
00:19:03.067 --> 00:19:04.936
You think I hate Boo Cheon?

227
00:19:05.676 --> 00:19:08.077
Who would say such a stupid thing?

228
00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:11.746
I don't hate Boo Cheon. I feel bad for him.

229
00:19:12.476 --> 00:19:16.087
He's stupid just like his father.

230
00:19:17.387 --> 00:19:20.887
Sometimes his heart is softer than Soo Man's.

231
00:19:21.157 --> 00:19:23.157
He seems spineless too.

232
00:19:23.426 --> 00:19:26.926
He should've taken after his determined mother.

233
00:19:26.926 --> 00:19:30.026
I thought you don't like Executive Jung.

234
00:19:30.026 --> 00:19:31.837
Executive Jung is genuine.

235
00:19:32.936 --> 00:19:34.897
To protect a huge mountain like Cheong A,

236
00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:37.736
it's only right to be greedy and determined like her.

237
00:19:40.077 --> 00:19:42.347
It's a shame she's not from my family.

238
00:19:42.377 --> 00:19:46.016
Nowadays, people make daughters, daughters-in-law,

239
00:19:46.716 --> 00:19:49.916
and wives to be in the chairwoman position.

240
00:19:49.916 --> 00:19:51.647
Other sons-in-law...

241
00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:54.357
and daughters-in-law's family will try to take a position too.

242
00:19:55.456 --> 00:19:59.627
That could collapse the great mountain.

243
00:20:00.426 --> 00:20:03.696
Cheong A should belong to only one man.

244
00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:08.196
Father. It's me.

245
00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.976
- I'll bring tea. - Thanks.

246
00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:26.716
We met in the morning.

247
00:20:26.716 --> 00:20:27.986
It's Soo Man's memorial soon,

248
00:20:28.387 --> 00:20:29.887
so I bought some candies.

249
00:20:30.226 --> 00:20:31.357
Really?

250
00:20:33.827 --> 00:20:36.627
Your brother will love it.

251
00:20:36.627 --> 00:20:37.627
Yes.

252
00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:41.597
While I was buying candies for him,

253
00:20:42.637 --> 00:20:45.037
I suddenly felt sorry for him.

254
00:20:45.976 --> 00:20:47.637
Even though Yeo Cheon's younger,

255
00:20:48.037 --> 00:20:49.847
he got married before Boo Cheon.

256
00:20:49.847 --> 00:20:51.246
Do you know any good woman?

257
00:20:51.506 --> 00:20:52.716
Look for one.

258
00:20:53.746 --> 00:20:55.587
I can't let him die single.

259
00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:56.647
Okay.

260
00:20:57.847 --> 00:20:59.756
You said...

261
00:21:00.057 --> 00:21:02.756
a daughter of a newspaper company would be good for Yeo Cheon.

262
00:21:03.387 --> 00:21:05.696
Do you have any suggestions for him?

263
00:21:14.537 --> 00:21:17.436
(Mo Hyun)

264
00:21:39.496 --> 00:21:43.526
(Pil Joo)

265
00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:04.686

279

What's wrong?

280
00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:03.107
When did you make this?

281
00:24:03.107 --> 00:24:05.006
In case all paper documents burn,

282
00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:07.436
this is all I have left. I should keep them securely.

283
00:24:13.377 --> 00:24:14.476
Na Mo Hyun...

284
00:24:15.147 --> 00:24:16.587
is in water right now.

285
00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:20.817
That's what you wanted to ask.

286
00:26:05.026 --> 00:26:06.057
Are you okay?

287
00:26:12.097 --> 00:26:13.337
How did you find me here?

288
00:26:21.637 --> 00:26:22.877
(Water level 5m)

289
00:26:29.817 --> 00:26:31.087
What are you doing here?

290
00:26:31.087 --> 00:26:32.657
I've been worried about you...

291
00:26:34.716 --> 00:26:37.026
since I met you...

292
00:26:38.256 --> 00:26:39.256
this morning.

293
00:26:40.827 --> 00:26:42.127
So I decided to come.

294
00:26:44.067 --> 00:26:45.236
I'm sorry...

295
00:26:45.696 --> 00:26:47.266
for showing up without notice.

296
00:26:47.266 --> 00:26:49.637
I said I don't want to listen to your excuse.

297
00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:52.607
Please...

298
00:26:53.436 --> 00:26:54.506
leave.

299
00:27:09.686 --> 00:27:11.456
I felt bad...

300
00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:15.196
when I heard Pil Joo tied himself to a chair...

301
00:27:15.196 --> 00:27:17.426
to stop himself from going to cheer for 2002 World Cup,

302
00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:21.367
so I wanted to make him happy.

303
00:27:22.537 --> 00:27:24.607
I supported him...

304
00:27:24.607 --> 00:27:26.736
when he said he couldn't leave...

305
00:27:26.837 --> 00:27:29.946
his rich friend Boo Cheon...

306
00:27:31.647 --> 00:27:32.776
for having no dream.

307
00:27:39.016 --> 00:27:40.756
When I see you,

308
00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:44.857
you remind me of the time I supported the wrong person.

309
00:27:48.157 --> 00:27:49.327
It makes me uncomfortable.

310
00:27:51.696 --> 00:27:53.597
I never want to see you again.

311
00:29:41.377 --> 00:29:42.877
I made my daughter cry...

312
00:29:43.307 --> 00:29:45.276
even though I'm her dad.

313
00:29:47.276 --> 00:29:49.147
Do you know how I feel now?

314
00:29:49.547 --> 00:29:51.347
Are you worried about...

315
00:29:52.117 --> 00:29:55.357
your crying daughter right now...

316
00:29:57.627 --> 00:29:58.956
or the political fund...

317
00:29:59.827 --> 00:30:02.966
you won't receive due to broken marriage?

318
00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:04.397
What?

319
00:30:04.397 --> 00:30:06.897
Pretend you don't know Na Mo Hyun and Director Jang are dating.

320
00:30:08.297 --> 00:30:11.107
If your daughter ever finds out,

321
00:30:12.176 --> 00:30:13.776
everything will go to waste.

322
00:30:13.837 --> 00:30:16.176
I can never do that until I can believe Cheong A.

323
00:30:17.807 --> 00:30:19.516
I've been repairing regional political party...

324
00:30:19.916 --> 00:30:22.287
in order to run for president.

325
00:30:22.986 --> 00:30:24.416
The fact that Mo Hyun is crying...

326
00:30:25.016 --> 00:30:28.486
suggests what Cheong A's up to isn't going right.

327
00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:30.327
It's not too late yet, Congressman Na.

328
00:30:31.726 --> 00:30:32.926
If you want,

329
00:30:33.696 --> 00:30:36.466
you can always let go of Cheong A.

330
00:30:37.797 --> 00:30:39.966
If you can't trust Cheong A,

331
00:30:41.166 --> 00:30:44.337
we'll look for other president who will approve...

332
00:30:45.307 --> 00:30:47.037
building Cheong A tower.

333
00:31:01.887 --> 00:31:03.026
What are you doing outside?

334
00:31:03.157 --> 00:31:04.587
The house you live in...

335
00:31:06.256 --> 00:31:08.256
is too dirty to go in!

336
00:31:09.226 --> 00:31:10.496
That hurts.

337
00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.337
This means I'm out of this marriage.

338
00:31:15.436 --> 00:31:16.966
You take Na Mo Hyun.

339
00:31:17.107 --> 00:31:18.936
- What are you talking about? - Your eyes!

340
00:31:20.436 --> 00:31:22.407
You swear with your eyes.

341
00:31:23.206 --> 00:31:26.216
I saw your eyes desperate to have...

342
00:31:26.276 --> 00:31:28.416
- Na Mo Hyun. - Don't put the blame on me.

343
00:31:29.817 --> 00:31:31.117
You can't fool me.

344
00:31:31.857 --> 00:31:34.486
If you're a law expert, I'm a relationship expert.

345
00:31:34.986 --> 00:31:38.087
Admit that you can't persuade Na Mo Hyun,

346
00:31:38.357 --> 00:31:40.127
and beg me for help.

347
00:31:41.327 --> 00:31:42.567
Don't...

348
00:31:43.367 --> 00:31:44.966
put blames on others.

349
00:31:44.996 --> 00:31:46.436
How dare you...

350
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:36.924
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E04 Money Flower "Pil Joo's Real Identity"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

351
00:33:17.256 --> 00:33:18.397
Mo Hyun.

352
00:33:19.157 --> 00:33:20.897
You should stop this.

353
00:33:22.526 --> 00:33:25.466
I'm so broken and ruined...

354
00:33:26.196 --> 00:33:28.807
that I can't stop myself...

355
00:33:30.466 --> 00:33:32.236
from pushing you towards the agony called Cheong A.

356
00:34:16.316 --> 00:34:17.347
Mom.

357
00:34:17.617 --> 00:34:19.617
Why are you running all of a sudden?

358
00:34:21.356 --> 00:34:25.026
Running isn't the plan you and Pil Joo discussed.

359
00:34:26.827 --> 00:34:29.396
- What is it? - Pil Joo's weird, Mom.

360
00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:32.937
Pil Joo came up with this plan.

361
00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:34.937
Even if it hurts your feelings,

362
00:34:35.267 --> 00:34:36.867
- you should endure it. - Actually,

363
00:34:38.736 --> 00:34:41.077
I don't like the way Pil Joo looks at Na Mo Hyun.

364
00:34:42.006 --> 00:34:43.046
So?

365
00:34:44.546 --> 00:34:46.917
- Pardon? - Jang Boo Cheon.

366
00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:48.646
Get a grip.

367
00:34:49.247 --> 00:34:51.486
It's a marriage of convenience.

368
00:34:53.887 --> 00:34:57.387
We've come a long way to read a stupid girl named Na Mo Hyun,

369
00:34:58.457 --> 00:35:00.196
but you should never forget the truth behind it.

370
00:35:02.896 --> 00:35:04.167
Even if...

371
00:35:05.196 --> 00:35:08.267
Kang Pil Joo sleeps with Na Mo Hyun every night,

372
00:35:09.267 --> 00:35:10.937
you must accomplish this marriage.

373
00:35:12.606 --> 00:35:13.606
Mom.

374
00:36:02.756 --> 00:36:04.227
What are you going to do about Na Mo Hyun?

375
00:36:04.227 --> 00:36:05.296
I'll tell you...

376
00:36:06.057 --> 00:36:07.557
once I come up with a plan.

377
00:38:05.676 --> 00:38:07.077
What a scene to watch.

378
00:38:07.546 --> 00:38:08.586
Kang Pil Joo...

379
00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:11.347
going after a woman he loves.

380
00:38:21.526 --> 00:38:22.896
What are you going to do after you chase her?

381
00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:44.146
On your first day in Mooshimwon,

382
00:38:45.517 --> 00:38:46.887
you left it with me.

383
00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:51.756
I took...

384
00:38:52.227 --> 00:38:53.396
your knife.

385
00:38:54.597 --> 00:38:56.667
And I saved your life...

386
00:38:57.466 --> 00:38:58.767
from a ditch.

387
00:39:01.497 --> 00:39:03.466
Think about where you started.

388
00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:42.046
Stay in the villa written on it.

389
00:39:42.977 --> 00:39:45.617
Father will send someone there.

390
00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:56.157
Yes?

391
00:39:57.526 --> 00:39:58.796
Okay.

392
00:40:03.867 --> 00:40:07.896
Grandfather is waiting in the house across the river.

393
00:40:21.247 --> 00:40:22.917
Mom!

394
00:40:51.376 --> 00:40:54.176
Pil Joo. Pil Joo, are you okay?

395
00:40:54.646 --> 00:40:55.687
Are you all right?

396
00:40:55.887 --> 00:40:59.117
I left Kyung Cheon in the water.

397
00:40:59.387 --> 00:41:01.316
Kyung Cheon!

398
00:41:01.517 --> 00:41:04.856
Mom, Kyung Cheon is in the water.

399
00:41:05.126 --> 00:41:07.756
I will go find Kyung Cheon.

400
00:41:07.827 --> 00:41:10.196
You got a leather bag from Yong Goo's junk shop...

401
00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:13.167
for me the other day.

402
00:41:13.167 --> 00:41:16.137
There's a note your mother left you...

403
00:41:16.267 --> 00:41:17.807
in the bag.

404
00:41:24.606 --> 00:41:26.617
(Please give this to Pil Joo when he grows up.)

405
00:41:28.316 --> 00:41:29.387
Eun Cheon.

406
00:41:30.617 --> 00:41:33.387
Until you have the power to protect yourself,

407
00:41:34.316 --> 00:41:35.457
you should...

408
00:41:35.827 --> 00:41:38.287
never say you're Eun Cheon.

409
00:41:43.926 --> 00:41:45.066
Jang Boo Cheon.

410
00:41:46.336 --> 00:41:47.667
Be my friend.

411
00:42:05.017 --> 00:42:06.557
You must be Kang Pil Joo.

412
00:42:17.396 --> 00:42:19.267
I heard you suffered...

413
00:42:19.767 --> 00:42:21.907
because of some misunderstanding with Boo Cheon.

414
00:42:22.667 --> 00:42:24.066
And I'm sorry...

415
00:42:24.767 --> 00:42:26.477
your father passed away...

416
00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:28.907
while you were in jail.

417
00:42:31.676 --> 00:42:33.247
Stay here with Boo Cheon,

418
00:42:34.276 --> 00:42:36.446
and think about what you're going to do with your life.

419
00:42:37.546 --> 00:42:38.917
I'll help you.

420
00:43:56.696 --> 00:43:58.126
Stab me if you can.

421
00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:01.196
Stab me,

422
00:44:02.207 --> 00:44:04.267
and take whatever you want.

423
00:44:46.676 --> 00:44:48.017
When Boo Cheon grows up,

424
00:44:48.946 --> 00:44:50.347
he'll become the chairman.

425
00:44:50.787 --> 00:44:51.917
Boo Cheon is the eldest son...

426
00:44:52.617 --> 00:44:54.557
of the Jang's.

427
00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:57.756
I'll...

428
00:44:58.187 --> 00:44:59.696
keep this knife.

429
00:45:01.767 --> 00:45:04.926
You can study living here with Boo Cheon.

430
00:45:07.367 --> 00:45:08.867
I don't want to force you to study.

431
00:45:10.137 --> 00:45:11.676
If you don't want to study,

432
00:45:12.736 --> 00:45:14.276
come to me and take this knife back.

433
00:45:16.577 --> 00:45:18.307
Once you take it back,

434
00:45:19.477 --> 00:45:22.446
you can't stay around Boo Cheon.

435
00:45:25.586 --> 00:45:26.657
If you study...

436
00:45:27.887 --> 00:45:30.727
while staying with Boo Cheon...

437
00:45:32.957 --> 00:45:34.227
and help him...

438
00:45:35.497 --> 00:45:37.526
become the chairman of Cheong A Group,

439
00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:40.597
I'll never forget your effort.

440
00:45:41.566 --> 00:45:43.207
I'm the eldest son.

441
00:45:44.037 --> 00:45:47.307
If Boo Cheon becomes the chairman, I'll take Cheong A Group back...

442
00:45:48.207 --> 00:45:51.176
and watch you grieve for it.

443
00:46:45.937 --> 00:46:46.966
Secretary Ahn.

444
00:46:53.437 --> 00:46:55.946
- Yes, Executive Jung. - Call Director Jang.

445
00:47:02.787 --> 00:47:04.417
Just do as Pil Joo says.

446
00:47:05.057 --> 00:47:07.287
I'm sure he'll come up with a good plan.

447
00:47:08.856 --> 00:47:09.926
And...

448
00:47:10.787 --> 00:47:11.926
Pil Joo...

449
00:47:12.327 --> 00:47:15.497
is not interested in Na Mo Hyun. Don't worry.

450
00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:19.896
I know...

451
00:47:20.767 --> 00:47:23.066
Pil Joo better than anyone.

452
00:47:24.066 --> 00:47:25.376
You know that, don't you?

453
00:47:26.037 --> 00:47:27.077
Yes.

454
00:47:28.847 --> 00:47:31.106
Go see Pil Joo. Now.

455
00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.086
Long time no see.

456
00:47:45.626 --> 00:47:47.097
Why is he so upset?

457
00:47:49.367 --> 00:47:50.896
Are you wearing...

458
00:47:51.296 --> 00:47:53.667
the operating gown to depress me?

459
00:47:53.796 --> 00:47:55.807
This gown is like my skin.

460
00:47:55.907 --> 00:47:57.537
How can I walk around without my skin?

461
00:48:07.046 --> 00:48:09.546
Dr. Hwang says you were sick.

462
00:48:09.546 --> 00:48:11.017
So he sent me to check you up.

463
00:48:11.017 --> 00:48:12.787
Go see a doctor when you are sick.

464
00:48:12.787 --> 00:48:15.586
Dr. Hwang is too busy to visit you at the hotel.

465
00:48:15.586 --> 00:48:16.926
I don't believe Cheong A Hospital.

466
00:48:17.486 --> 00:48:19.296
Your father died there.

467
00:48:19.296 --> 00:48:22.167
You don't want to do a blood test. We don't need it as you're not sick.

468
00:48:23.796 --> 00:48:27.196
When are you going to quit and help your brother?

469
00:48:27.736 --> 00:48:29.966
Or you can learn how to manage Cheong A Hospital.

470
00:48:29.966 --> 00:48:32.176
Do you want me to die young like Dad did?

471
00:48:32.307 --> 00:48:35.146
People should do what they really want...

472
00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:36.477
to live long.

473
00:48:43.046 --> 00:48:45.457
As he talked to me,

474
00:48:45.586 --> 00:48:47.617
his back vibrated with his voice.

475
00:48:48.017 --> 00:48:51.756
And I felt a tug at my heart. I keep thinking about it.

476
00:48:51.997 --> 00:48:54.657
You were so drunk that you didn't even know who he was.

477
00:48:54.756 --> 00:48:56.026
But you still remember the feeling?

478
00:48:56.126 --> 00:48:59.836
Yes. I could feel he cared about me so much.

479
00:48:59.966 --> 00:49:03.466
Even though I was drunk, I felt protected and safe.

480
00:49:07.006 --> 00:49:09.446
- Is that guy you? - No, it's you.

481
00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:12.876
My plan is to make you become...

482
00:49:13.776 --> 00:49:15.046
the guy from the conversation.

483
00:49:16.187 --> 00:49:18.187
I ended up like this because I pretended to be you.

484
00:49:19.517 --> 00:49:20.856
Do I have to do that again?

485
00:49:38.207 --> 00:49:39.207
Hey,

486
00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:42.407
look me straight in the eye.

487
00:49:44.606 --> 00:49:45.676
Are you...

488
00:49:47.247 --> 00:49:48.816
really not interested in Mo Hyun?

489
00:49:50.747 --> 00:49:51.856
I'm not.

490
00:50:02.667 --> 00:50:05.137
I can never read what's on your mind.

491
00:50:12.977 --> 00:50:14.977
- Is this all I need? - Yes.

492
00:50:16.506 --> 00:50:17.977
You should remember the order.

493
00:50:38.097 --> 00:50:41.137
(Dear Mo Hyun)

494
00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:05.497
(Mo Hyun...)

495
00:51:09.196 --> 00:51:12.267
Chief Campaigner Na Gi Chul of Shindaehan Party...

496
00:51:12.267 --> 00:51:14.167
is here with us to elaborate on it.

497
00:51:14.236 --> 00:51:16.466
Regarding the election pledges of Shindaehan Party,

498
00:51:16.767 --> 00:51:19.106
many believe that your progressive idea must have been...

499
00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:20.606
taken into account...

500
00:51:20.736 --> 00:51:23.876
more than the idea of Congressman Lee, the candidate.

501
00:51:24.276 --> 00:51:25.816
What do you think about it?

502
00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:29.446
Firstly, we're well aware...

503
00:51:30.316 --> 00:51:32.316
that people are very interested...

504
00:51:32.316 --> 00:51:34.387
- in the promises... - Mo Hyun.

505
00:51:34.387 --> 00:51:35.926
- You've got something delivered. - of each party.

506
00:51:36.457 --> 00:51:38.227
- What? - So...

507
00:51:38.287 --> 00:51:40.626
- to make the change people want, - Who sent it?

508
00:51:40.796 --> 00:51:42.796
- It's Jang Boo Cheon. - we're doing...

509
00:51:42.796 --> 00:51:43.966
- Who is Jang Boo Cheon? - our best...

510
00:51:44.097 --> 00:51:45.736
to focus all our capabilities...

511
00:51:45.736 --> 00:51:47.137
to live up to their expectations.

512
00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:48.137
(Addressee: Na Mo Hyun, Addresser: Jang Boo Cheon)

513
00:51:48.336 --> 00:51:50.807
As the chief campaigner,

514
00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:52.236
- Jang Boo Cheon... - I am...

515
00:51:52.577 --> 00:51:54.736
- I've never heard of the name. - doing my best...

516
00:51:54.776 --> 00:51:57.146
to help the party to get the best result.

517
00:51:57.276 --> 00:51:58.446
(Addressee: Na Mo Hyun, Addresser: Jang Boo Cheon)

518
00:52:06.417 --> 00:52:07.417
What is this?

519
00:52:14.227 --> 00:52:17.727
Mo Hyun, I didn't know I'd send you these photos.

520
00:52:19.167 --> 00:52:20.896
I went there to photograph birds,

521
00:52:21.196 --> 00:52:22.907
and took photos of you.

522
00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:25.606
That's the day...

523
00:52:26.037 --> 00:52:27.937
I fell in love with you.

524
00:52:44.126 --> 00:52:46.356
A son of large firm's chairman wanted to marry me...

525
00:52:46.356 --> 00:52:47.926
because of my dad's title.

526
00:52:47.957 --> 00:52:49.696
Many are interested in the titles of others' fathers.

527
00:52:49.696 --> 00:52:52.696
I never want people to focus more on my parents...

528
00:52:53.736 --> 00:52:54.966
when I get married.

529
00:52:54.966 --> 00:52:56.907
Pil Joo visited a restaurant in hotel...

530
00:52:56.937 --> 00:52:59.937
and happened to overhear what you said in your blind date.

531
00:53:00.376 --> 00:53:03.977
Also, he knows how much I like you,

532
00:53:04.546 --> 00:53:05.876
so we switched our names...

533
00:53:05.876 --> 00:53:08.017
- I'm Jang Boo Cheon. - when we first met in the cafe.

534
00:53:24.997 --> 00:53:27.637
When I found you on the street that night,

535
00:53:29.167 --> 00:53:30.736
all I had in my mind...

536
00:53:32.736 --> 00:53:35.046
was that I had to protect you...

537
00:53:36.077 --> 00:53:37.207
until you got home safely.

538
00:54:17.946 --> 00:54:19.957
At the cafe we've always visited together,

539
00:54:20.486 --> 00:54:23.287
I'll be waiting for you every night.

540
00:55:28.657 --> 00:55:31.187
I got stood up again.

541
00:56:02.586 --> 00:56:04.626
(Mo Hyun)

542
00:56:31.146 --> 00:56:32.157
She's here.

543
00:56:33.856 --> 00:56:34.887
Mo Hyun...

544
00:56:35.756 --> 00:56:36.827
She's here.

545
00:56:37.526 --> 00:56:38.597
Hey.

546
00:56:40.426 --> 00:56:42.196
Can you hear my heart pounding?

547
00:56:44.426 --> 00:56:45.437
Pil Joo.

548
00:56:49.807 --> 00:56:50.807
What should I say to her?

549
00:56:52.907 --> 00:56:55.176
I must greet her with sweet talk.

550
00:56:55.276 --> 00:56:56.747
You came here every day.

551
00:56:57.276 --> 00:56:58.716
Haven't you thought of anything?

552
00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:05.716
Of course, I have.

553
00:57:21.537 --> 00:57:22.637
Boo Cheon.

554
00:57:51.497 --> 00:57:53.097
I am sorry...

555
00:57:55.207 --> 00:57:56.367
for making you wait so long.

556
00:58:54.396 --> 00:58:55.566
I've met Congressman Na...

557
00:58:56.597 --> 00:58:59.537
at the event held by Cheong A Welfare Foundation.

558
00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:01.196
When I see him on the news,

559
00:59:01.597 --> 00:59:02.937
I can tell he hasn't changed at all.

560
00:59:02.937 --> 00:59:04.767
He's grown so much thinner...

561
00:59:05.176 --> 00:59:06.876
since he started working as chief campaigner.

562
00:59:08.907 --> 00:59:10.176
That's right.

563
00:59:11.106 --> 00:59:12.546
He's the chief campaigner.

564
00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:15.247
I almost forgot it.

565
00:59:15.247 --> 00:59:18.457
I understand. Not everyone is interested in politics.

566
00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:23.457
Chairman Jang wants you to get married as soon as possible,

567
00:59:24.086 --> 00:59:25.497
but the school semester isn't over.

568
00:59:25.497 --> 00:59:26.626
That's right.

569
00:59:26.926 --> 00:59:28.626
I talked about it with Boo Cheon...

570
00:59:28.626 --> 00:59:31.597
and decided to work until the contract terminates.

571
00:59:32.196 --> 00:59:33.336
You should've asked...

572
00:59:33.796 --> 00:59:37.466
the elders of each family before you made a decision.

573
00:59:38.676 --> 00:59:39.676
Okay.

574
00:59:39.836 --> 00:59:40.876
And...

575
00:59:42.046 --> 00:59:45.446
I'm still using honorifics to my future daughter-in-law.

576
00:59:45.446 --> 00:59:49.247
It's proper that you should ask me to talk casually.

577
00:59:51.347 --> 00:59:53.417
Please talk casually.

578
00:59:56.986 --> 00:59:58.057
What's that smile?

579
00:59:58.057 --> 01:00:00.896
I thought you wanted to treat me with respect...

580
01:00:01.356 --> 01:00:04.626
by using honorifics as I haven't married Boo Cheon yet.

581
01:00:05.497 --> 01:00:08.506
I felt embarrassing to have misunderstood you,

582
01:00:08.867 --> 01:00:10.307
so I smiled before I knew it.

583
01:00:11.537 --> 01:00:12.907
There is a time and a place.

584
01:00:14.776 --> 01:00:16.347
If you smile all the time like now,

585
01:00:17.176 --> 01:00:20.117
people might look down on you, so be careful.

586
01:00:22.546 --> 01:00:23.646
Okay.

587
01:00:24.017 --> 01:00:25.216
Mom.

588
01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:29.526
Grandfather keeps asking me when Mo Hyun will visit his room.

589
01:00:35.026 --> 01:00:36.167
You don't have to do it.

590
01:00:36.267 --> 01:00:38.767
Do it properly later. Just sit down.

591
01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:47.376
Is your father Congressman Na?

592
01:00:47.437 --> 01:00:49.046
Yes, he is.

593
01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:51.747
What good news for a change!

594
01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:53.747
Listen.

595
01:00:54.376 --> 01:00:55.417
Yes, Father.

596
01:00:55.417 --> 01:00:57.017
Hold their wedding in two months.

597
01:00:58.687 --> 01:00:59.687
Well,

598
01:01:00.086 --> 01:01:01.787
is there any other plan?

599
01:01:02.287 --> 01:01:04.426
I need you to cancel it and get married first.

600
01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:08.667
I'll bear the entire expenses regarding your marriage.

601
01:01:08.767 --> 01:01:11.097
So tell Congressman Na that both families won't...

602
01:01:11.097 --> 01:01:12.796
accept any congratulatory money.

603
01:01:12.796 --> 01:01:14.037
Yes, Grandfather.

604
01:01:15.407 --> 01:01:18.066
Make sure that our in-laws receive...

605
01:01:18.437 --> 01:01:20.776
the most luxurious wedding gift in the country.

606
01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:22.276
I will, Father.

607
01:01:22.977 --> 01:01:25.917
You don't have to prepare anything for us.

608
01:01:30.816 --> 01:01:31.816
Hello.

609
01:01:31.816 --> 01:01:33.557
It's nice to meet you. Please have a seat.

610
01:01:43.597 --> 01:01:45.296
I'll touch up your makeup.

611
01:01:45.296 --> 01:01:46.367
Okay.

612
01:03:24.126 --> 01:03:25.896
You can do it.

613
01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:46.486
(Money Flower)

614
01:04:03.566 --> 01:04:06.937
Boo Cheon has the romance of the century.

615
01:04:06.937 --> 01:04:09.676
Can you promise me that you'll love Mo Hyun forever?

616
01:04:09.676 --> 01:04:10.747
Yes.

617
01:04:10.776 --> 01:04:12.477
Boo Cheon had a girlfriend?

618
01:04:12.477 --> 01:04:15.287
That's such a disgrace to our family.

619
01:04:15.287 --> 01:04:17.917
Go meet Congressman Na's daughter, and call off your marriage.

620
01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:20.986
I didn't know you also like birds.

621
01:04:20.986 --> 01:04:23.057
I was really sad as I couldn't meet him in the end.

622
01:04:23.057 --> 01:04:25.896
I hope I could meet him just once.

623
01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:28.526
What will you do after you have Cheong A in your hands?

624
01:04:28.526 --> 01:04:31.367
I'll wipe Executive Jung's tears and tell her...

625
01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.867
the truth about who I really am.
