1
00:00:06.378 --> 00:00:08.407
(The products and organizations have been created for the drama.)

2
00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:10.748
(The story and its characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:37.467
Until he pokes...

4
00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.738
his own eyes,

5
00:00:40.308 --> 00:00:42.378
cuts his own flesh,

6
00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:46.247
and throttles himself,

7
00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:48.848
don't give way to anything,

8
00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:51.387
Ms. Jung Mal Ran.

9
00:00:57.488 --> 00:00:58.957
(Episode 3)

10
00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:48.378
What?

11
00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:49.438
Let's look at documents about Na Mo Hyun again.

12
00:02:51.878 --> 00:02:54.748
I should work on her more, so that I can marry her fast.

13
00:02:56.148 --> 00:02:58.218
I want to get help from my in-law's...

14
00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:00.648
just like Yeo Cheon.

15
00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:21.607
Executive Jung.

16
00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:23.368
Your hand...

17
00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.178
I'm going to sleep in tomorrow.

18
00:03:27.477 --> 00:03:29.248
Don't look for me until I call you.

19
00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:30.808
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:04:17.727 --> 00:04:18.758
It's fine.

21
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.028
I've been through a lot worse.

22
00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:46.557
That cafe.

23
00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:50.227
- She seems to go there a lot. - She likes reading there.

24
00:04:50.357 --> 00:04:52.057
You know a woman...

25
00:04:52.557 --> 00:04:55.667
who is confident and feels comfortable to be alone.

26
00:04:57.398 --> 00:04:59.537
Someone who'd say, "I'm not twisted at all."

27
00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:03.667
You know the one that makes you confused...

28
00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:05.377
with a straight face.

29
00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:09.948
- What? - How do you know from a glance?

30
00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:12.518
You're not the only one who has insight into people.

31
00:05:12.518 --> 00:05:13.848
I have it too.

32
00:05:14.448 --> 00:05:17.588
Especially in terms of women,

33
00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:19.718
I'm way better.

34
00:05:22.127 --> 00:05:23.158
She's pretty.

35
00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:33.367
Isn't that what you want?

36
00:05:33.398 --> 00:05:36.008
If it was for fun, then yes,

37
00:05:38.778 --> 00:05:40.377
but I have to marry her.

38
00:05:40.877 --> 00:05:43.607
I prefer...

39
00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:47.518
personality...

40
00:05:48.718 --> 00:05:49.888
more than the look.

41
00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:53.117
That's why you're a weirdo.

42
00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:03.227
Hey.

43
00:06:04.537 --> 00:06:06.867
When should I sleep with Na Mo Hyun?

44
00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:13.138
You can decide...

45
00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:16.708
when you two like each other.

46
00:06:16.948 --> 00:06:18.747
I need to sleep first...

47
00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.078
to find out whether I like her or not.

48
00:06:21.218 --> 00:06:22.818
You never know until you sleep with her.

49
00:06:28.828 --> 00:06:31.497
Why did you turn it off? I'm going to review it.

50
00:06:32.598 --> 00:06:33.598
Turn it back on.

51
00:06:54.278 --> 00:06:55.388
What are you doing?

52
00:06:55.987 --> 00:06:57.687
You want Cheong A, don't you?

53
00:07:00.187 --> 00:07:01.427
Then listen carefully.

54
00:07:03.658 --> 00:07:05.028
Unless...

55
00:07:05.497 --> 00:07:07.828
you impress Na Mo Hyun sincerely,

56
00:07:10.127 --> 00:07:11.138
you are...

57
00:07:12.497 --> 00:07:15.367
over with the marriage as well as your dream.

58
00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:22.977
I know.

59
00:07:24.307 --> 00:07:25.348
I know it already.

60
00:07:29.117 --> 00:07:30.117
Go.

61
00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:31.917
Turn the light off.

62
00:07:36.528 --> 00:07:38.557
I can't face my mom.

63
00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.497
Where should we go now? Shall we grab coffee?

64
00:08:20.737 --> 00:08:22.568
How long do you plan on avoiding your mom?

65
00:08:23.307 --> 00:08:24.537
Until I can.

66
00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:28.547
She's not that weak.

67
00:08:29.648 --> 00:08:31.318
There you go again.

68
00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:33.418
Before you came to my house,

69
00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:36.188
I lived with my mom for 10 years without my dad.

70
00:08:36.218 --> 00:08:38.688
I experienced agony that you're not aware of.

71
00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:40.818
You'll never understand it.

72
00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:44.328
Inheritance from my maternal grandfather.

73
00:08:44.428 --> 00:08:46.458
All that cash from my mom's investment.

74
00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:48.227
Inheritance from my dad.

75
00:08:50.098 --> 00:08:52.737
Cheong A shares my grandfather gave me as a gift.

76
00:08:52.737 --> 00:08:55.468
Cheong A shares I bought behind my grandfather.

77
00:08:55.538 --> 00:08:58.938
No mother in Korea...

78
00:08:59.308 --> 00:09:00.377
is as rich as my mom.

79
00:09:02.107 --> 00:09:03.277
But...

80
00:09:04.178 --> 00:09:06.477
she lived with a thought that it will be all taken away...

81
00:09:06.477 --> 00:09:07.987
from the moment she became...

82
00:09:08.588 --> 00:09:10.188
a daughter-in-law of Cheong A Group.

83
00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:12.688
Who would believe that?

84
00:09:16.727 --> 00:09:17.727
I would.

85
00:09:22.168 --> 00:09:23.168
Except you.

86
00:09:32.277 --> 00:09:33.308
Today,

87
00:09:34.877 --> 00:09:38.078
I'm going to the library, bookstore, and snack bar...

88
00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.318
Na Mo Hyun goes to.

89
00:09:39.318 --> 00:09:41.147
Since I need to like her,

90
00:09:41.688 --> 00:09:43.117
I'm going to try to understand her.

91
00:09:47.718 --> 00:09:50.788
I'm not sure if this is going to be possible, but it's sad...

92
00:09:51.328 --> 00:09:52.958
that this is my only choice.

93
00:09:53.798 --> 00:09:54.968
This is driving me crazy.

94
00:10:17.147 --> 00:10:18.288
Hi.

95
00:10:21.627 --> 00:10:23.088
Hey, tell me Na Mo Hyun's schedule today.

96
00:10:23.088 --> 00:10:24.958
Bird sanctuary in the mouth of Nakdong River.

97
00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.198
But what is she doing here?

98
00:10:28.428 --> 00:10:30.568
My goodness. I can't believe it.

99
00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.668
- I didn't expect to meet you here. - I know.

100
00:10:35.338 --> 00:10:37.977
- What are you doing here? - Pardon?

101
00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:42.477
- I'm here to grab coffee. - I see.

102
00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:44.477
Have a seat.

103
00:10:45.418 --> 00:10:46.548
Thank you.

104
00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:54.688
Nice to meet you.

105
00:10:56.127 --> 00:10:57.558
I'm Jang Boo Cheon.

106
00:10:58.928 --> 00:11:01.767
Hi. I'm Na Mo Hyun.

107
00:11:02.227 --> 00:11:03.468
Yes.

108
00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:07.338
I'm Kang Pil Joo. Kang Pil Joo.

109
00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.038
- Kang Pil Joo? - Yes.

110
00:11:12.678 --> 00:11:14.208
I should give your hat back.

111
00:11:14.308 --> 00:11:16.678
- Right. - I have it.

112
00:11:17.848 --> 00:11:19.147
Can you wait here?

113
00:11:19.147 --> 00:11:20.277
I'll grab it from home.

114
00:11:20.277 --> 00:11:22.617
No. You don't need to.

115
00:11:23.887 --> 00:11:24.987
Where's your house?

116
00:11:41.708 --> 00:11:43.907
(Boo Cheon)

117
00:11:44.607 --> 00:11:45.877
Please enjoy.

118
00:12:14.637 --> 00:12:16.168
(Jo In Ho)

119
00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.538
Dad, I'm off!

120
00:12:17.877 --> 00:12:18.977
When did you get home?

121
00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:20.877
- That hat... - Yes.

122
00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:23.578
I ran into the owner of the hat coincidentally.

123
00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:30.288
Some guy rescued a bird with that hat...

124
00:12:30.318 --> 00:12:31.657
at the migratory bird sanctuary.

125
00:13:00.918 --> 00:13:02.048
Boo Cheon,

126
00:13:02.647 --> 00:13:04.348
what are you staring at?

127
00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:06.188
Nothing is on the stairs.

128
00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:07.857
Because there's nothing there.

129
00:13:09.987 --> 00:13:11.198
Nothing is on the stairs.

130
00:13:11.598 --> 00:13:12.598
What?

131
00:13:30.578 --> 00:13:31.617
Cheers.

132
00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:33.348
Let's clink our glasses.

133
00:13:43.558 --> 00:13:44.757
My gosh.

134
00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:51.237
I'm buying you drinks for returning the hat to me.

135
00:13:52.338 --> 00:13:54.298
Perhaps, we should've gone to a better place.

136
00:13:55.767 --> 00:13:57.038
I like this place.

137
00:13:57.668 --> 00:13:59.407
I come here often.

138
00:14:00.637 --> 00:14:02.848
You're quite a drinker.

139
00:14:02.848 --> 00:14:06.218
I don't drink until I pass out. I just enjoy having a few drinks.

140
00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:11.487
I'm serious.

141
00:14:15.357 --> 00:14:17.357
I'm a middle school teacher.

142
00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:19.958
I see.

143
00:14:20.497 --> 00:14:21.897
I didn't know you were a teacher.

144
00:14:21.897 --> 00:14:23.367
I'd be embarrassed...

145
00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:27.068
if I run into students or parents when I'm drunk.

146
00:14:28.038 --> 00:14:29.507
So I try to keep it under control.

147
00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:36.948
What do you do, Mr. Kang?

148
00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:44.318
Pil Joo.

149
00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.318
She asked you what you do for a living.

150
00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:49.727
Oh, right. You asked me.

151
00:14:50.627 --> 00:14:51.698
I...

152
00:14:53.857 --> 00:14:56.328
I work at Strategy Team of Cheong A Group.

153
00:14:57.027 --> 00:14:59.038
Boo Cheon is the director of Cheong A Trading.

154
00:15:00.338 --> 00:15:02.107
You two work at a fancy company.

155
00:15:03.668 --> 00:15:05.607
Wait. You know...

156
00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.907
the president of Cheong A Group has a son?

157
00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:09.308
His name frequently comes up in the newspapers.

158
00:15:09.678 --> 00:15:11.678
I think his name is Jang Yeo Cheon.

159
00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:14.277
Mr. Jang's name is similar to his name.

160
00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.647
Yeo Cheon is my cousin.

161
00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:21.288
For that matter, President Jang of Cheong A Group is...

162
00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.387
my uncle.

163
00:15:23.387 --> 00:15:26.227
I only asked because you guys had similar names.

164
00:15:28.527 --> 00:15:29.527
I see.

165
00:15:32.737 --> 00:15:34.198
- Goodbye, sir. - Take care.

166
00:15:35.838 --> 00:15:36.968
Good night.

167
00:15:48.088 --> 00:15:50.288
Is there a reason you're in a good mood?

168
00:15:50.288 --> 00:15:51.788
No. I'm just happy.

169
00:15:54.527 --> 00:15:56.387
Mo Hyun is late.

170
00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.157
I wonder if she's with the hat's owner.

171
00:16:07.808 --> 00:16:12.107
If you ask me why I went there to watch the birds,

172
00:16:12.107 --> 00:16:15.078
She's happy. That's why she keeps going around to watch them.

173
00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:18.548
She pretends that she knows the birds to make her feel better.

174
00:16:19.777 --> 00:16:21.017
I'm just happy to see them.

175
00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:25.288
When the migratory birds return,

176
00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:29.027
it means that the environment hasn't been contaminated yet.

177
00:16:29.527 --> 00:16:32.357
I just wanted to let the birds know that I knew, which makes me happy.

178
00:16:33.098 --> 00:16:36.168
I'm so happy to hear someone else is happy to see them.

179
00:16:37.938 --> 00:16:39.038
On that day,

180
00:16:41.098 --> 00:16:44.267
you just went home with the blanket around you.

181
00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:47.808
I thought you were so agreeable.

182
00:16:49.147 --> 00:16:50.147
That's probably why...

183
00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:54.588
I took your hat on that day.

184
00:16:55.688 --> 00:16:57.857
I was hoping to see if I would be able to...

185
00:16:58.387 --> 00:16:59.588
see you again.

186
00:17:07.967 --> 00:17:09.068
I wanted...

187
00:17:09.967 --> 00:17:12.768
to see you again, Ms. Na.

188
00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:16.967
I hoped that you'd keep my hat.

189
00:17:17.667 --> 00:17:19.407
I made sure I kept it.

190
00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:21.808
Ms. Na.

191
00:17:23.707 --> 00:17:25.248
You are beautiful,

192
00:17:27.048 --> 00:17:28.518
but strangely,

193
00:17:29.588 --> 00:17:30.748
I noticed...

194
00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:34.927
your kind personality before your beauty.

195
00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:37.657
Both of us fell for each other's personality.

196
00:17:58.748 --> 00:17:59.947
Well, what happened was...

197
00:18:00.617 --> 00:18:02.288
I couldn't get through him with my words.

198
00:18:21.907 --> 00:18:22.907
I got it.

199
00:18:23.367 --> 00:18:25.607
I'll report to him I found nothing and quit afterward.

200
00:18:26.677 --> 00:18:28.947
Just double my fee.

201
00:18:28.947 --> 00:18:30.248
I'll triple it.

202
00:18:31.147 --> 00:18:33.417
Keep working for President Woo.

203
00:18:33.748 --> 00:18:35.848
However, you'll only...

204
00:18:36.617 --> 00:18:40.518
deliver information that we give you to President Woo.

205
00:18:42.228 --> 00:18:43.228
Is that clear?

206
00:18:48.897 --> 00:18:49.927
(President Woo)

207
00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:55.607
"President Woo, Kang Pil Joo and Jang Boo Cheon..."

208
00:18:55.838 --> 00:18:58.607
"haven't gone out at all today."

209
00:18:59.308 --> 00:19:00.338
Got that?

210
00:19:01.978 --> 00:19:03.447
(President Woo)

211
00:19:10.288 --> 00:19:12.457
Yes, it's me.

212
00:19:12.558 --> 00:19:13.588
Yes.

213
00:19:14.258 --> 00:19:15.357
Okay.

214
00:19:19.598 --> 00:19:22.927
Attorney Kang hasn't made any movement so far.

215
00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:26.338
Is that so?

216
00:19:27.367 --> 00:19:28.838
I'll call in Boo Cheon tomorrow...

217
00:19:29.238 --> 00:19:31.838
and have him sign the contract for turning over Daeil Distribution.

218
00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.407
I'd advise you to hurry.

219
00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:36.808
It's essential in making Cheong A Trading into a holding company.

220
00:19:40.447 --> 00:19:41.788
What a hassle.

221
00:19:42.988 --> 00:19:46.488
I'm giving my son what I have. How can it be so complicated?

222
00:19:50.528 --> 00:19:52.058
Nothing comes easy, does it?

223
00:20:03.707 --> 00:20:04.707
Pil Joo, are you leaving?

224
00:20:04.877 --> 00:20:05.907
Yes.

225
00:20:07.177 --> 00:20:08.207
Yong Goo.

226
00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:12.478
You need to remove all the articles regarding me and Boo Cheon.

227
00:20:12.478 --> 00:20:14.018
Every online article?

228
00:20:14.117 --> 00:20:15.588
Yes, especially the photos.

229
00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:19.758
I don't care how much it costs. Wipe them clean.

230
00:20:20.187 --> 00:20:21.528
Okay. I will do.

231
00:20:21.528 --> 00:20:22.528
Thanks.

232
00:20:41.848 --> 00:20:43.848
I guess those two are meant to be.

233
00:20:43.848 --> 00:20:46.048
How could they meet at that cafe?

234
00:20:48.187 --> 00:20:50.687
Good work. Go and get some rest.

235
00:20:50.988 --> 00:20:52.058
Okay.

236
00:20:56.657 --> 00:20:58.127
For the time being,

237
00:20:58.498 --> 00:21:00.697
I'll be Boo Cheon, and vice versa.

238
00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:02.728
What nonsense is that?

239
00:21:02.927 --> 00:21:04.798
It just happened.

240
00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:07.038
Is it because Na Mo Hyun would hate Boo Cheon...

241
00:21:07.937 --> 00:21:09.867
as the son of Cheong A Group?

242
00:21:09.967 --> 00:21:10.967
Yes.

243
00:21:13.377 --> 00:21:15.907
People who claim that they hate the money and the riches.

244
00:21:16.848 --> 00:21:19.717
Tell them to make the claim only after having as much money as me.

245
00:21:20.518 --> 00:21:23.518
I'm sure they want to have money and become rich,

246
00:21:23.518 --> 00:21:27.387
but they're sad because they don't have a chance. Isn't that right?

247
00:21:27.857 --> 00:21:31.127
Those fox-like witches who talk about sour grapes...

248
00:21:32.427 --> 00:21:33.657
disgust me.

249
00:23:13.397 --> 00:23:15.328
- When did you get here? - Just now.

250
00:23:17.167 --> 00:23:18.338
Were you waiting for me?

251
00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:22.637
You know the stairs in front of Na Mo Hyun's house?

252
00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:25.377
I kissed her there.

253
00:23:28.947 --> 00:23:31.377
I got so lost after you left.

254
00:23:31.677 --> 00:23:34.647
I didn't understand what she was saying at all.

255
00:23:37.447 --> 00:23:39.488
We talked until dawn on the stairs.

256
00:23:41.457 --> 00:23:43.558
She said she's glad to meet me again.

257
00:23:46.998 --> 00:23:49.127
Hey. Hey.

258
00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:51.197
Hey. Listen to me.

259
00:23:54.437 --> 00:23:55.637
Then...

260
00:23:56.838 --> 00:23:59.338
she said the most memorable thing I said was...

261
00:23:59.707 --> 00:24:03.107
how I was happy to see the migratory birds again...

262
00:24:04.978 --> 00:24:07.947
and seeing her personality before her look.

263
00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:11.018
It's all from you.

264
00:24:12.857 --> 00:24:13.957
So...

265
00:24:14.927 --> 00:24:17.558
I did what I'm best at.

266
00:24:36.848 --> 00:24:37.848
Good job.

267
00:24:39.417 --> 00:24:41.387
I did.

268
00:24:41.417 --> 00:24:42.518
Let's wait...

269
00:24:43.088 --> 00:24:45.117
for a while until she calls first.

270
00:24:47.357 --> 00:24:48.357
Do you think...

271
00:24:50.187 --> 00:24:52.197
I can handle Na Mo Hyun?

272
00:24:54.498 --> 00:24:55.667
I could hear...

273
00:24:56.697 --> 00:24:59.738
her heartbeat so loud when I hugged her.

274
00:25:01.538 --> 00:25:05.508
I never heard it from women who slept with me so easily...

275
00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:09.348
for being the son of Cheong A Group.

276
00:25:12.848 --> 00:25:13.848
I felt...

277
00:25:14.887 --> 00:25:15.947
pressured.

278
00:26:11.907 --> 00:26:13.338
When will you stop avoiding me?

279
00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:21.617
Good morning.

280
00:26:37.697 --> 00:26:40.437
It's fine. It won't leave a scar. It's almost healed.

281
00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:41.967
That's a relief.

282
00:26:43.008 --> 00:26:44.778
- Where's Pil Joo? - Probably still in bed.

283
00:26:51.548 --> 00:26:52.917
It's sunny.

284
00:26:53.117 --> 00:26:56.417
I'll have tea ready in the yard, Executive Jung.

285
00:27:43.697 --> 00:27:44.697
Pil Joo.

286
00:27:45.637 --> 00:27:47.498
Every time you wanted to have tea,

287
00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:50.167
you always talked about something important.

288
00:27:52.637 --> 00:27:53.637
What is it?

289
00:27:59.348 --> 00:28:00.518
I'll return...

290
00:28:02.117 --> 00:28:03.848
Daeil Distribution back in its place.

291
00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:08.088
How? How will you do that?

292
00:28:12.697 --> 00:28:14.697
I know you wouldn't answer me.

293
00:28:17.728 --> 00:28:19.098
I'll...

294
00:28:19.867 --> 00:28:21.308
reward you enough...

295
00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:22.907
when you bring Distribution back.

296
00:28:25.278 --> 00:28:27.137
I'd prefer if you tell me exactly what you want.

297
00:28:27.278 --> 00:28:29.478
I'll focus on making it work only.

298
00:28:30.147 --> 00:28:31.478
As always,

299
00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:34.018
it's your decision.

300
00:28:34.018 --> 00:28:36.417
This always challenges me.

301
00:28:37.748 --> 00:28:39.088
How much I should give you...

302
00:28:39.788 --> 00:28:41.187
not to look cheap...

303
00:28:41.488 --> 00:28:42.728
or too much,

304
00:28:42.828 --> 00:28:44.998
but just enough to impress you.

305
00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:48.098
I'll bring Daeil Distribution back even if you don't pay me.

306
00:28:49.598 --> 00:28:50.728
Boo Cheon needs...

307
00:28:51.338 --> 00:28:54.607
Daeil Distribution shares one day...

308
00:28:55.338 --> 00:28:56.768
in order to become the leader.

309
00:28:57.937 --> 00:28:59.238
What's the reason?

310
00:29:01.407 --> 00:29:03.177
Why are you desperate to make...

311
00:29:03.848 --> 00:29:05.818
Boo Cheon the chairman as much as I am?

312
00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:20.328
People call me...

313
00:29:20.897 --> 00:29:22.627
Cheong A's dog.

314
00:29:24.697 --> 00:29:26.338
If I'm going to be a dog anyway,

315
00:29:27.568 --> 00:29:31.038
I'd rather give my owner Cheong A,

316
00:29:33.137 --> 00:29:34.548
and I will...

317
00:29:35.978 --> 00:29:37.207
be the best dog.

318
00:30:01.937 --> 00:30:04.268
The best thing I've done for my son...

319
00:30:05.677 --> 00:30:07.508
is having you beside him.

320
00:30:10.348 --> 00:30:12.177
It'll be Boo Cheon's father's memorial soon.

321
00:30:14.177 --> 00:30:17.117
I wish to have Distribution back before that.

322
00:30:37.141 --> 00:30:43.605
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E03 Money Flower "The Promise"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

323
00:31:01.897 --> 00:31:03.568
Pil Joo. I've sent the document.

324
00:31:15.078 --> 00:31:21.687
(Jang Yeo Cheon)

325
00:31:27.117 --> 00:31:30.387
(Jang Yeo Cheon)

326
00:31:35.427 --> 00:31:38.197
(Jang Yeo Cheon)

327
00:31:39.867 --> 00:31:43.137
The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.

328
00:31:43.667 --> 00:31:45.338
Kang Pil Joo.

329
00:31:48.207 --> 00:31:51.008
The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.

330
00:31:58.187 --> 00:31:59.318
(To Director Jang Yeo Cheon)

331
00:31:59.788 --> 00:32:03.588
What if your father or grandfather find it out?

332
00:32:04.857 --> 00:32:06.357
I don't even want to think about it.

333
00:32:07.228 --> 00:32:11.098
So please help me for the last time, Mom.

334
00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:13.098
Just sell one of the paintings from the gallery...

335
00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:14.568
that Grandfather doesn't know of.

336
00:32:14.707 --> 00:32:17.137
I'll put the money back that I lost from investing.

337
00:32:18.838 --> 00:32:20.407
It's all my fault.

338
00:32:20.778 --> 00:32:23.947
I shouldn't have let you invest in stocks...

339
00:32:23.947 --> 00:32:25.578
with your grandfather's slush fund.

340
00:32:26.278 --> 00:32:28.518
I will need some money...

341
00:32:28.518 --> 00:32:30.248
to compete with Boo Cheon...

342
00:32:30.947 --> 00:32:32.657
for the stocks of Cheong A Trading.

343
00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:40.957
What are you doing here?

344
00:32:41.058 --> 00:32:42.328
Let's go right now.

345
00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:43.998
To where?

346
00:32:44.028 --> 00:32:45.268
Your father...

347
00:32:46.238 --> 00:32:47.238
I mean,

348
00:32:48.738 --> 00:32:50.538
The president of Cheong A Group...

349
00:32:51.637 --> 00:32:53.738
told me to bring you to complete the transition...

350
00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:55.248
of Daeil Distribution.

351
00:33:01.117 --> 00:33:02.187
Let's go.

352
00:33:02.217 --> 00:33:03.818
Are you really going to sign the contract?

353
00:33:05.518 --> 00:33:08.927
I still can't stand the fact that you took it away from me,

354
00:33:09.457 --> 00:33:10.488
but I have no choice.

355
00:33:11.427 --> 00:33:12.857
He's the boss.

356
00:33:14.598 --> 00:33:15.867
Where's Kang Pil Joo?

357
00:33:32.778 --> 00:33:34.018
You jerk.

358
00:33:35.588 --> 00:33:38.357
You jerk. How dare you dig up on me?

359
00:33:40.357 --> 00:33:41.788
Is this your answer?

360
00:33:41.788 --> 00:33:45.558
All right. You're a cowardly idiot. This is my answer.

361
00:33:47.157 --> 00:33:49.768
You idiot. Stop it.

362
00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:54.907
Hey.

363
00:33:55.538 --> 00:33:57.707
Kang Pil Joo, open it.

364
00:33:58.377 --> 00:33:59.478
Open the door!

365
00:34:00.907 --> 00:34:02.278
Kang Pil Joo!

366
00:34:11.918 --> 00:34:15.657
Kang Pil Joo, open it. Let's talk face to face.

367
00:35:00.567 --> 00:35:02.967
Yeo Cheon, I still can't believe...

368
00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:05.407
that you want to give Daeil Distribution...

369
00:35:05.407 --> 00:35:07.078
back to Boo Cheon,

370
00:35:07.337 --> 00:35:08.808
but I get it anyway.

371
00:35:09.208 --> 00:35:12.578
I need to know the reason though.

372
00:35:13.648 --> 00:35:16.717
I need a reasonable explanation to permit it.

373
00:35:19.587 --> 00:35:20.617
I was...

374
00:35:21.257 --> 00:35:23.527
going to turn it over to Yeo Cheon today.

375
00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:26.027
You all may leave now.

376
00:35:26.598 --> 00:35:29.128
If Yeo Cheon doesn't change his mind until tomorrow morning,

377
00:35:29.128 --> 00:35:30.168
come back again.

378
00:35:32.898 --> 00:35:34.237
Do it by tonight.

379
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:37.268
If you fail to get your grandfather's permission by then,

380
00:35:37.978 --> 00:35:40.538
I'll tell him you used...

381
00:35:41.947 --> 00:35:43.177
his slush fund.

382
00:35:45.717 --> 00:35:48.087
Are you worried the Financial Supervisory Service...

383
00:35:48.348 --> 00:35:50.587
and the National Tax Service would make an issue of it?

384
00:35:50.987 --> 00:35:53.317
Attorney Kang will take care of everything.

385
00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.958
I want to keep a close relationship with Boo Cheon.

386
00:35:57.998 --> 00:35:59.598
If I get Daeil Distribution,

387
00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.728
I won't be able to do that.

388
00:36:03.668 --> 00:36:04.837
Is this because...

389
00:36:05.367 --> 00:36:08.168
you did something wrong and are trying to cover it up?

390
00:36:08.168 --> 00:36:09.337
No, Grandfather.

391
00:36:09.337 --> 00:36:10.407
Please...

392
00:36:11.038 --> 00:36:12.907
let me have Daeil Distribution.

393
00:36:13.777 --> 00:36:16.907
You want Yeo Cheon to run Daeil Distribution despite his will.

394
00:36:17.978 --> 00:36:19.117
I know that's because of me.

395
00:36:20.217 --> 00:36:21.788
Because you don't like me.

396
00:36:23.018 --> 00:36:25.887
I'll try harder to make you like me better.

397
00:36:25.887 --> 00:36:28.487
Grandfather, please do as Boo Cheon asks.

398
00:36:31.058 --> 00:36:32.858
You two seem to have a close relationship.

399
00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:34.967
It's not all that bad.

400
00:36:36.268 --> 00:36:37.768
Then I'll let Boo Cheon run...

401
00:36:37.967 --> 00:36:40.137
Daeil Distribution for now.

402
00:36:40.637 --> 00:36:41.668
Yes, Chairman.

403
00:36:41.907 --> 00:36:44.407
It'd just be for the time being, do you understand?

404
00:36:44.507 --> 00:36:45.507
Yes, sir.

405
00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:12.168
Hello?

406
00:37:12.567 --> 00:37:13.898
Is this Kang Pil Joo?

407
00:37:15.467 --> 00:37:16.467
Pil Joo?

408
00:37:18.208 --> 00:37:19.837
Isn't this Kang Pil Joo's phone?

409
00:37:20.208 --> 00:37:21.878
- I'm sorry. - Na Mo Hyun.

410
00:37:22.608 --> 00:37:25.018
This is Kang Pil Joo.

411
00:37:25.317 --> 00:37:27.348
Maybe I called you too early.

412
00:37:27.348 --> 00:37:28.387
No.

413
00:37:28.688 --> 00:37:31.387
You called me just at the right time.

414
00:37:40.027 --> 00:37:41.768
Are you going hiking so early in the morning?

415
00:37:42.697 --> 00:37:44.637
You're trimming trees so early in the morning.

416
00:37:44.898 --> 00:37:46.567
Hiking sounds more reasonable.

417
00:37:46.567 --> 00:37:50.108
I have a lot of trees to trim within today.

418
00:37:50.108 --> 00:37:51.337
So I need to hurry.

419
00:37:52.677 --> 00:37:53.777
Where's Attorney Kang?

420
00:37:55.078 --> 00:37:58.277
I can go hiking without Attorney Kang.

421
00:37:58.878 --> 00:38:00.478
I don't need him.

422
00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.547
Okay.

423
00:38:27.378 --> 00:38:28.478
Gosh, it's cold.

424
00:38:43.927 --> 00:38:45.998
I'm sorry. The bus was late.

425
00:38:45.998 --> 00:38:47.027
It's okay.

426
00:38:48.398 --> 00:38:49.467
You must be cold.

427
00:39:02.378 --> 00:39:03.407
Here.

428
00:39:04.547 --> 00:39:06.748
Have some. It'll keep you warm.

429
00:39:11.558 --> 00:39:12.558
Oh, it's rice water.

430
00:39:12.558 --> 00:39:14.217
My mom packs me some rice water...

431
00:39:14.217 --> 00:39:16.058
whenever I go hiking.

432
00:39:18.797 --> 00:39:19.898
I didn't know...

433
00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:22.567
I'd drink rice water in a mountain.

434
00:39:26.367 --> 00:39:27.907
- Can I have some more? - Sure.

435
00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:56.828
It lists the problems of our party...

436
00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:58.098
and solutions for that.

437
00:39:59.938 --> 00:40:01.237
That's impressive.

438
00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:05.578
Now that you're the chief campaigner,

439
00:40:06.538 --> 00:40:08.748
you should have a grip on your party.

440
00:40:12.518 --> 00:40:14.587
You did a good job appropriating the funds...

441
00:40:15.547 --> 00:40:16.887
for me to dominate the party...

442
00:40:17.188 --> 00:40:20.558
and for Cheong A Group to lobby a bill.

443
00:40:20.887 --> 00:40:24.027
It even states when and how the money will be spent.

444
00:40:24.387 --> 00:40:28.027
But it doesn't specify when I'd get the money.

445
00:40:28.168 --> 00:40:29.197
You'll get the money...

446
00:40:29.768 --> 00:40:31.938
on their wedding day.

447
00:40:39.078 --> 00:40:40.378
Thank you for the rice water.

448
00:40:49.047 --> 00:40:50.387
Take some time before descending.

449
00:40:52.117 --> 00:40:54.728
You'll need to go down a little later than I do.

450
00:40:55.027 --> 00:40:56.058
Yes, sir.

451
00:41:21.148 --> 00:41:22.148
Are you tired?

452
00:41:23.688 --> 00:41:26.487
Please go ahead. My dad told me...

453
00:41:26.858 --> 00:41:29.828
I should adjust my speed to the slow person on a mountain.

454
00:41:31.358 --> 00:41:32.458
Wait for me.

455
00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:34.598
- Come on. - Gosh.

456
00:42:00.188 --> 00:42:01.527
You're still here.

457
00:42:08.728 --> 00:42:10.728
I now know exactly what I should do...

458
00:42:10.797 --> 00:42:12.337
to become the president,

459
00:42:13.598 --> 00:42:15.737
but it never ensures my daughter's...

460
00:42:15.837 --> 00:42:17.268
happiness.

461
00:42:18.337 --> 00:42:19.337
So...

462
00:42:20.378 --> 00:42:21.978
I know it's shameless,

463
00:42:22.308 --> 00:42:24.348
but I came back to you.

464
00:42:24.648 --> 00:42:25.648
Sir,

465
00:42:27.277 --> 00:42:28.447
your daughter is...

466
00:42:28.987 --> 00:42:31.047
the only one who can guarantee it.

467
00:42:32.358 --> 00:42:33.387
She can...

468
00:42:33.958 --> 00:42:35.527
marry the guy...

469
00:42:36.228 --> 00:42:37.858
she truly loves only.

470
00:42:39.598 --> 00:42:40.598
If she decided...

471
00:42:41.228 --> 00:42:43.697
to marry Director Jang,

472
00:42:44.567 --> 00:42:46.967
that means she's assured of her happiness.

473
00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:49.308
Please trust her...

474
00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:52.878
and wait, sir.

475
00:42:59.478 --> 00:43:00.547
You should adjust your speed...

476
00:43:01.418 --> 00:43:03.748
to the slow person on a mountain.

477
00:43:12.898 --> 00:43:13.927
What?

478
00:43:20.067 --> 00:43:21.467
I want to introduce you...

479
00:43:21.768 --> 00:43:23.668
to my father.

480
00:43:24.237 --> 00:43:25.237
Sorry?

481
00:43:28.848 --> 00:43:29.907
I see.

482
00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:32.348
- Maybe next time. - No, today.

483
00:43:32.947 --> 00:43:34.317
Mr. Yang!

484
00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:37.487
Here!

485
00:43:38.087 --> 00:43:39.617
It's me, Mo Hyun.

486
00:43:41.427 --> 00:43:42.987
I'll be right there!

487
00:43:45.128 --> 00:43:46.128
Let's go.

488
00:43:50.398 --> 00:43:51.467
Hurry up.

489
00:43:58.878 --> 00:44:00.007
Where is my dad?

490
00:44:01.848 --> 00:44:04.518
Well, he went down.

491
00:44:05.277 --> 00:44:07.277
I think he's a little exhausted today.

492
00:44:12.117 --> 00:44:15.228
Let me introduce him to you. He's Mr. Yang Sang Do.

493
00:44:15.387 --> 00:44:17.027
He's a congressman's assistant.

494
00:44:20.498 --> 00:44:23.867
My dad is Congressman Na Gi Chul.

495
00:44:25.598 --> 00:44:27.067
Oh, he's a congressman.

496
00:44:27.567 --> 00:44:28.737
- Yes. - It's good to see you.

497
00:44:37.348 --> 00:44:39.518
I'm afraid I'll have to meet your father next time.

498
00:44:39.617 --> 00:44:40.617
What a shame.

499
00:44:41.848 --> 00:44:43.617
We'll keep climbing up.

500
00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:44.987
Okay.

501
00:44:45.518 --> 00:44:46.558
Let's get going.

502
00:45:22.987 --> 00:45:24.358
I made gimbap...

503
00:45:24.458 --> 00:45:26.797
to eat with you.

504
00:45:37.438 --> 00:45:38.438
Thank you.

505
00:45:44.547 --> 00:45:45.848
You never thought it'd be tasty,

506
00:45:45.947 --> 00:45:48.317
- but it is, right? - Right.

507
00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.257
You should eat too.

508
00:46:10.237 --> 00:46:13.708
Next time, you should call me first.

509
00:46:14.507 --> 00:46:15.978
I called you this time.

510
00:46:17.648 --> 00:46:18.648
Actually,

511
00:46:21.117 --> 00:46:24.587
- I couldn't call you because... - I was rather glad you didn't.

512
00:46:25.518 --> 00:46:28.927
- Sorry? - I was glad that you didn't...

513
00:46:30.358 --> 00:46:32.728
call me right after I went into my house.

514
00:46:35.228 --> 00:46:38.867
While I was waiting for your call, I thought a lot about you...

515
00:46:39.538 --> 00:46:41.308
and even missed you.

516
00:46:44.907 --> 00:46:46.978
If you had called me right away,

517
00:46:47.038 --> 00:46:48.777
I might've thought of you...

518
00:46:49.648 --> 00:46:51.317
as a womanizer.

519
00:46:57.117 --> 00:46:58.188
It's getting serious.

520
00:47:00.288 --> 00:47:02.087
Not only did your inner beauty...

521
00:47:04.157 --> 00:47:06.427
captivate my heart but so did your outer beauty.

522
00:47:21.848 --> 00:47:24.777
I want to know more about you even when you're right next to me.

523
00:47:27.277 --> 00:47:28.688
I've never met someone like you.

524
00:48:19.367 --> 00:48:22.038
Father, I'm home.

525
00:48:24.737 --> 00:48:25.837
How many did I do?

526
00:48:26.478 --> 00:48:28.708
You did two this time, sir.

527
00:48:29.277 --> 00:48:32.348
- Goodness. - But they were perfect.

528
00:48:32.817 --> 00:48:35.047
You're really good at it, sir.

529
00:48:35.148 --> 00:48:37.018
Really? Let me do more.

530
00:48:39.418 --> 00:48:42.927
Three...

531
00:48:42.987 --> 00:48:45.098
- My gosh. - Goodness.

532
00:48:45.157 --> 00:48:47.157
- Sir! Are you okay? - It hurts.

533
00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:48.427
- Are you okay? - Sir!

534
00:48:48.498 --> 00:48:49.998
- Are you all right? - Goodness.

535
00:48:49.998 --> 00:48:51.168
Do you recognize me?

536
00:49:09.887 --> 00:49:11.087
Let me do it.

537
00:49:12.157 --> 00:49:13.617
I left a side dish...

538
00:49:14.058 --> 00:49:16.987
made with natural abalone reef which is his favorite.

539
00:49:18.898 --> 00:49:22.398
Ms. Icheon brought fresh abalones.

540
00:49:33.808 --> 00:49:35.748
He successfully met with Congressman Na.

541
00:49:37.248 --> 00:49:40.217
- He'll be here to give a report. - Is that so?

542
00:49:56.867 --> 00:50:00.367
So you'll give him money on the wedding day?

543
00:50:00.938 --> 00:50:04.108
- Yes. - There was no bargaining.

544
00:50:05.438 --> 00:50:08.978
Although Congressman Na appreciated our suggestion,

545
00:50:11.947 --> 00:50:13.978
we'll still have to keep an eye on him.

546
00:50:13.978 --> 00:50:15.717
Once he gets a large amount of money,

547
00:50:15.717 --> 00:50:17.188
he might change his mind.

548
00:50:17.188 --> 00:50:18.918
I'll take good care of it.

549
00:50:19.518 --> 00:50:20.918
Don't worry, sir.

550
00:50:20.918 --> 00:50:22.858
Don't let Boo Cheon know...

551
00:50:23.257 --> 00:50:24.858
the details.

552
00:50:25.328 --> 00:50:27.328
- He's a useless... - Father.

553
00:50:28.297 --> 00:50:30.128
I am worried...

554
00:50:30.367 --> 00:50:33.067
that you might slip your tongue in front of Boo Cheon's wife.

555
00:50:33.067 --> 00:50:34.867
I'll be more careful.

556
00:50:38.637 --> 00:50:42.078
In case things go wrong with the money we give Congressman Na,

557
00:50:42.478 --> 00:50:44.878
it won't have anything to do with me.

558
00:50:46.817 --> 00:50:49.547
Make sure not to drag me and Seong Man in.

559
00:50:49.748 --> 00:50:50.788
Okay?

560
00:50:51.257 --> 00:50:53.918
I'll have someone prepared for insurance.

561
00:50:54.958 --> 00:50:56.628
Executive Jung,

562
00:50:57.157 --> 00:50:58.757
you just saw me exercising.

563
00:50:59.197 --> 00:51:00.828
My goal is five pushups...

564
00:51:00.828 --> 00:51:03.067
with Ms. Han on my back.

565
00:51:03.367 --> 00:51:06.637
No matter how hard I try with all my might,

566
00:51:06.898 --> 00:51:07.907
I can barely manage two.

567
00:51:08.637 --> 00:51:10.938
Your father-in-law has got this old now.

568
00:51:13.108 --> 00:51:15.578
Goodness, I'm tired.

569
00:52:21.407 --> 00:52:22.648
You startled me.

570
00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:24.078
What was that?

571
00:52:24.518 --> 00:52:25.648
You're embarrassing me.

572
00:52:27.887 --> 00:52:29.047
Did you have a good time...

573
00:52:30.018 --> 00:52:31.217
with Na Mo Hyun today?

574
00:52:31.657 --> 00:52:32.688
Yes.

575
00:52:33.087 --> 00:52:34.317
You saw me earlier today.

576
00:52:45.867 --> 00:52:46.867
Pil Joo.

577
00:52:48.168 --> 00:52:49.168
I think...

578
00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:52.078
I'm falling for Na Mo Hyun.

579
00:52:56.248 --> 00:52:57.277
I,

580
00:52:57.848 --> 00:52:59.177
Jang Boo Cheon,

581
00:52:59.848 --> 00:53:02.248
found myself resisting an impulse...

582
00:53:02.248 --> 00:53:03.617
to spend a night with her.

583
00:53:04.918 --> 00:53:07.657
I could've given her a deep kiss before saying goodbye.

584
00:53:07.657 --> 00:53:08.927
That's who I am.

585
00:53:09.987 --> 00:53:11.328
But I wanted to be nice.

586
00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:15.328
I want to have...

587
00:53:16.527 --> 00:53:18.367
a decent relationship with her.

588
00:53:18.898 --> 00:53:19.998
That's good.

589
00:53:21.367 --> 00:53:22.407
I'm glad...

590
00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:24.337
that you felt that way.

591
00:53:24.608 --> 00:53:25.608
You.

592
00:53:26.108 --> 00:53:28.308
Stay out of my relationship and wedding.

593
00:53:30.208 --> 00:53:32.648
How you took Daeil Distribution back.

594
00:53:33.177 --> 00:53:35.087
I won't ask whom you met in the mountain...

595
00:53:35.087 --> 00:53:37.018
and what you are planning...

596
00:53:37.018 --> 00:53:38.958
with my grandfather and mom.

597
00:53:40.788 --> 00:53:43.358
I know you wouldn't answer me even if I asked you.

598
00:53:44.288 --> 00:53:45.328
But you're being...

599
00:53:46.458 --> 00:53:47.898
so annoying these days.

600
00:53:48.168 --> 00:53:50.367
If you don't marry her,

601
00:53:50.828 --> 00:53:52.038
all my effort...

602
00:53:52.498 --> 00:53:55.007
will end in vain, you know.

603
00:53:55.168 --> 00:53:56.237
I'll...

604
00:53:57.237 --> 00:53:59.038
marry her without your help.

605
00:54:00.277 --> 00:54:01.407
I want it to be meaningful.

606
00:54:03.248 --> 00:54:04.277
I'll do it right.

607
00:54:10.288 --> 00:54:11.518
All right, Boo Cheon.

608
00:54:12.458 --> 00:54:13.958
That's what you're supposed to do.

609
00:54:14.387 --> 00:54:15.387
Okay?

610
00:54:18.157 --> 00:54:19.197
Do that.

611
00:54:19.998 --> 00:54:21.228
It's your wedding.

612
00:54:34.848 --> 00:54:36.777
So tell me about it.

613
00:54:37.078 --> 00:54:38.978
Wait. So...

614
00:54:39.217 --> 00:54:42.117
are you saying Kang Pil Joo is Mr. Right?

615
00:54:45.518 --> 00:54:47.757
You've finally met someone better than Jo In Ho.

616
00:54:47.757 --> 00:54:48.757
What?

617
00:54:48.757 --> 00:54:51.058
Don't even play innocent.

618
00:54:51.058 --> 00:54:53.427
Well... I was just curious...

619
00:54:53.427 --> 00:54:56.628
how In Ho is doing now.

620
00:54:56.867 --> 00:54:59.038
What about his parents? Are they alive?

621
00:54:59.038 --> 00:55:01.337
Gosh, Mom.

622
00:55:01.337 --> 00:55:04.168
All right. I know I went too far.

623
00:55:05.378 --> 00:55:06.507
Oh, that's right.

624
00:55:06.878 --> 00:55:09.007
What about the man who carried you on his back?

625
00:55:22.188 --> 00:55:24.558
As he talked to me,

626
00:55:24.797 --> 00:55:26.858
his back vibrated with his voice.

627
00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:30.967
And I felt a tug at my heart. I keep thinking about it.

628
00:55:31.567 --> 00:55:34.268
You were so drunk that you didn't even know who he was.

629
00:55:34.268 --> 00:55:35.808
But you still remember the feeling?

630
00:55:35.907 --> 00:55:36.938
Yes.

631
00:55:38.038 --> 00:55:41.248
I could feel he cared about me so much.

632
00:55:41.378 --> 00:55:45.817
Even though I was drunk, I felt protected and safe.

633
00:55:46.348 --> 00:55:49.887
I even felt like he'd come out of nowhere and save me...

634
00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.058
whenever I was in danger

635
00:56:29.288 --> 00:56:31.328
You tied yourself to a chair?

636
00:56:35.797 --> 00:56:37.098
During the 2002 World Cup,

637
00:56:38.067 --> 00:56:40.768
the whole country was so excited to cheer for our national team.

638
00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:42.637
I had the second-round state bar exam,

639
00:56:42.708 --> 00:56:45.137
but I couldn't concentrate on my studies. It was driving me crazy.

640
00:56:46.007 --> 00:56:47.237
So I tied myself.

641
00:56:49.547 --> 00:56:51.248
I had no choice.

642
00:56:52.478 --> 00:56:53.617
Passing the bar exam...

643
00:56:54.717 --> 00:56:57.748
was the only way I could survive.

644
00:57:00.688 --> 00:57:04.527
I didn't know that. Now I feel sorry I enjoyed the World Cup games...

645
00:57:04.858 --> 00:57:06.328
rooting for Korea.

646
00:57:07.927 --> 00:57:09.128
Mo Hyun.

647
00:57:10.228 --> 00:57:12.098
We didn't know each other back then.

648
00:57:15.168 --> 00:57:17.137
If I knew you back then,

649
00:57:17.808 --> 00:57:19.907
I would've supported you...

650
00:57:20.038 --> 00:57:22.108
by studying together.

651
00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:36.188
Let's go!

652
00:57:36.188 --> 00:57:37.587
We still have enough time.

653
00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:40.128
- Please. - Korea scored in the second half.

654
00:57:40.828 --> 00:57:42.628
We still have five minutes left.

655
00:57:46.697 --> 00:57:49.337
- To the other side... - Republic of Korea!

656
00:57:49.337 --> 00:57:50.867
The ball is in.

657
00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:52.578
- Republic of Korea! - Republic of Korea!

658
00:57:53.608 --> 00:57:55.547
- Republic of Korea! - Republic of Korea!

659
00:57:55.878 --> 00:57:57.108
He kicked it to the center.

660
00:57:57.208 --> 00:57:59.918
- Go! - Goal!

661
00:58:00.447 --> 00:58:02.648
- Goal! - Ahn Jung Hwan scores!

662
00:58:02.717 --> 00:58:04.558
The game is over! Ahn Jung Hwan!

663
00:58:04.617 --> 00:58:06.458
- I can't believe this. - He's amazing.

664
00:58:07.927 --> 00:58:08.987
Thank you, Mo Hyun.

665
00:58:10.927 --> 00:58:12.197
I finally fulfilled my wish.

666
00:58:13.998 --> 00:58:16.898
Even if I went out to the city hall and rooted for Korea,

667
00:58:16.898 --> 00:58:18.337
it wouldn't have been as exciting as now.

668
00:58:18.367 --> 00:58:20.938
You missed the World Cup games...

669
00:58:20.938 --> 00:58:22.438
because of the bar exam.

670
00:58:24.478 --> 00:58:26.108
I wanted to give you the experience as a gift.

671
00:58:28.447 --> 00:58:30.007
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

672
00:58:45.358 --> 00:58:46.427
