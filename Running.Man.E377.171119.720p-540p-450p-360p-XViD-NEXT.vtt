1
00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:07.360
(Today's race will be held...)

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.030
(at Incheon International Airport Terminal 2.)

3
00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:11.331
(It's a race before their penalty.)

4
00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:13.066
- Hello. - Hi.

5
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.868
- Hi. - Good morning.

6
00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:15.869
(Jong Kook is on his way back from the US.)

7
00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.038
- Hi. - Hello.

8
00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:19.306
(5 male members assemble without Jong Kook.)

9
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.709
Let's give it up for Seok Jin.

10
00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:25.178
- Why? - Let's give it up for Seok Jin.

11
00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:26.212
(He's nervous.)

12
00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.381
He removed his mole and got his eyebrows done.

13
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:29.416
You did?

14
00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:30.750
(Seok Jin got some treatment to improve his looks.)

15
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.986
- You did? - Don't his eyebrows look darker?

16
00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:35.588
(His eyebrows do seem darker than before.)

17
00:00:36.323 --> 00:00:37.424
Fine. I got my eyebrows tattooed.

18
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:39.559
- Seriously? - Yes, look at his eyebrows.

19
00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.161
- Don't I look nice? - It look good.

20
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.063
- Don't they look natural? - They do. They look real.

21
00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.464
- They do indeed. - But how did you know that?

22
00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:46.499
They don't look natural at all. You're worse than Jae Seok.

23
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.767
- They don't look natural. - Hey, that was uncalled for.

24
00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:49.002
Let's keep this on the low.

25
00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:52.672
- He needs to get a touch-up next. - Did you want them to slant down?

26
00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:54.407
- Just like this? - They're slanted downwards.

27
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.510
- This is a new style. - I was told they looked natural.

28
00:00:58.211 --> 00:00:59.379
(They respect him for his drive.)

29
00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.015
I don't know if you're aware of this.

30
00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:05.618
We are at International Terminal 2 at Incheon International Airport.

31
00:01:05.618 --> 00:01:07.787
This terminal will open next year in January.

32
00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:09.656
- Really? - This is amazing!

33
00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:12.559
- I'm so honored to come here. - This place looks really nice.

34
00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:17.564
They're trying to raise the number of passengers they can accommodate.

35
00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:18.698
- It's getting better. - It's improving.

36
00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:20.600
- They can accommodate more. - This feels real now.

37
00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:22.669
- But it's far... - It is.

38
00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:24.304
- from International Terminal One. - That's true.

39
00:01:24.304 --> 00:01:25.338
Going to the wrong one will be a huge problem.

40
00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:27.407
- Passengers should come earlier. - Right. I advise leaving earlier.

41
00:01:27.407 --> 00:01:29.709
If you want to use Terminal Two,

42
00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.812
- leave early to have enough time. - Terminal Two is...

43
00:01:32.812 --> 00:01:34.881
- really great. - Come to Korea. Welcome to Korea.

44
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:35.949
Sorry?

45
00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:38.184
(Come to Korea. Welcome to Korea.)

46
00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:40.553
Whom are you speaking to?

47
00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:42.155
To the citizens of the world.

48
00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:43.957
The world doesn't know who you are.

49
00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:46.059
- I just... - Some people might be watching.

50
00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:48.895
When I said, "Welcome to Korea," before, he scoffed at me.

51
00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:51.398
(About 30 seconds ago)

52
00:01:51.998 --> 00:01:53.967
(We are ready for more tourists. Welcome to Korea.)

53
00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:55.969
(Scoffing)

54
00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.538
(Welcome to Korea? That came out of nowhere.)

55
00:01:58.972 --> 00:02:00.974
But he said the same thing while laughing at me.

56
00:02:00.974 --> 00:02:02.242
- Right. - You heard him, didn't you?

57
00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:04.844
- Actually... - First off,

58
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:08.415
we'll be playing Crisis of the Family, Race of Heirs.

59
00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:15.155
You are the sons of Running Airline's affluent chairman.

60
00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:18.792
- Nice. I should've dressed up. - Really? We are?

61
00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:22.429
You'll be able to choose your ranks for your inheritance shortly.

62
00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:23.863
The oldest must have the highest rank.

63
00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:28.234
The one who survives the race with the highest rank will be the...

64
00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:30.503
- final heir to receive inheritance. - Really?

65
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.873
And the rest of the members will face humiliating penalty.

66
00:02:33.873 --> 00:02:35.508
There are prizes and penalties?

67
00:02:35.508 --> 00:02:36.509
Yes.

68
00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:38.945
(Eliminate other heirs of higher ranks while concealing their ranks.)

69
00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:42.482
(How will these six sons' battle for inheritance end?)

70
00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:46.786
- You'll pick your ranks now. - Our ranks?

71
00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:47.821
Bring in the table, please.

72
00:02:47.987 --> 00:02:50.523
A table? I guess they prepared something.

73
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.559
What are these? These are paper planes.

74
00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.162
- What do we do? - You may each choose one.

75
00:02:56.162 --> 00:02:58.531
(The number inside the paper plane is their rank.)

76
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:00.099
- My gosh. - No way.

77
00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.100
You have the blue one.

78
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.502
(The ranks will determine their fates in the race.)

79
00:03:02.502 --> 00:03:03.636
This is my rank.

80
00:03:03.636 --> 00:03:04.671
(Tight security is the key.)

81
00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:05.772
This isn't bad.

82
00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:08.975
(They must figure out others' ranks to win without revealing theirs.)

83
00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:10.977
- Jong Kook, this is yours. - Okay. What is this?

84
00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:12.178
Make sure no one sees.

85
00:03:13.913 --> 00:03:15.982
(The order of the ranks)

86
00:03:15.982 --> 00:03:18.051
(Haha, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan)

87
00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:20.253
You all checked your ranks, right?

88
00:03:20.253 --> 00:03:21.287
- Yes. - Yes.

89
00:03:21.488 --> 00:03:23.890
Now, we are going to introduce...

90
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.926
six heiresses who will help you become the heir.

91
00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:29.496
- Come on! Yes! - Great.

92
00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:31.764
Welcome!

93
00:03:31.764 --> 00:03:33.500
(The sons lighten up at the news of guests.)

94
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.469
(An elegant love song, "She", fills the airport.)

95
00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:37.670
- This song... - You're playing a song for them?

96
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.972
Why are they trying to look fancy?

97
00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:41.040
- Here they come. - Who are they?

98
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.909
- Is it Ji Hyo? - That's a maiden ghost!

99
00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.678
(A maiden ghost?)

100
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:47.280
She looks like a maiden ghost.

101
00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:48.681
- They startled me. - My goodness.

102
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:50.350
My gosh. Ji Hyo scared the wits out of me.

103
00:03:50.383 --> 00:03:52.785
- You two look really scary. - My gosh.

104
00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:55.421
(The male members are shocked. They dressed up as ghosts, right?)

105
00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:56.990
They really look like ghosts.

106
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.224
Ji Hyo is Annabelle.

107
00:03:58.224 --> 00:03:59.225
Annabelle and the virgin ghost.

108
00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:01.327
So Min looks very scary.

109
00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:03.363
Why does she look especially scary today?

110
00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:05.999
They startled me.

111
00:04:06.132 --> 00:04:09.068
- I am embarrassed. - Why do you say that?

112
00:04:09.068 --> 00:04:11.237
We dressed up to play the heiresses.

113
00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:13.006
That's a grandma necklace.

114
00:04:13.172 --> 00:04:15.942
- They look like sisters. - I know.

115
00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:17.844
- They look like sisters. - Okay. Pass.

116
00:04:17.844 --> 00:04:19.612
(Haha suddenly cuts in.)

117
00:04:20.179 --> 00:04:21.814
- Move. - Let's move along swiftly.

118
00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:23.816
- Okay. - Thank you for your hard work.

119
00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:25.351
- You look pretty. - Who is next?

120
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:26.519
You look pretty.

121
00:04:26.553 --> 00:04:27.787
Let's move on to the next guest.

122
00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:29.355
(This is the beginning.)

123
00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:30.590
Who is that?

124
00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:32.425
Who is that?

125
00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:33.459
(The 6 sons eagerly wait for the 1st partner.)

126
00:04:34.627 --> 00:04:36.062
This is the beginning.

127
00:04:36.062 --> 00:04:37.363
(This elegant woman has the dignity of an heiress.)

128
00:04:37.363 --> 00:04:38.865
- This is the beginning. - Here she comes.

129
00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:40.300
Should I be excited about this?

130
00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:42.035
Should I?

131
00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:46.372
(A sophisticated woman with presence, Go Sung Hee)

132
00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.142
- It's Go Sung Hee. - Go Sung Hee is here.

133
00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.611
(Go Sung Hee is a rising actress who was in dramas...)

134
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:53.880
(such as "While You Were Sleeping" and "Miss Korea".)

135
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.518
(She visits the show to play an heir's partner today.)

136
00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:00.353
She is a beauty.

137
00:05:00.353 --> 00:05:02.288
- Seriously. - Today,

138
00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:04.123
we have a lot of female guests.

139
00:05:04.123 --> 00:05:06.192
- Let's call them over first. - Let's call them over.

140
00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:07.393
Please come on out.

141

(The girl with fruit-like charms, Kim Se Jeong of Gugudan)

143

(She is the center of Gugudan, who is back with the first album.)

144
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:22.475
(Se Jeong captivates the hearts of the producers and advertisers.)

145
00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:23.943
Se Jeong will join us.

146
00:05:23.943 --> 00:05:26.412
- Let's call over our next guest. - Okay.

147
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.647
Please come on out.

148
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.349
- Why are you laughing? - I knew it.

149
00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:31.651
- You are revealing yourself... - I knew it.

150
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:32.885
as a member of "Gag Concert".

151
00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:35.021
- It's Ji Min. - Ji Min.

152
00:05:36.055 --> 00:05:37.423
She dressed up.

153

Ji Min dressed up.

154
00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.894
(Is she playing the president's wife today?)

155
00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:43.997
(She looks luxurious.)

156
00:05:43.997 --> 00:05:45.865
She is Tina, Ssan Tina.

157
00:05:45.865 --> 00:05:47.000
Tina.

158
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.302
Let's meet the next guest. Please come on out.

159
00:05:49.302 --> 00:05:50.536
(She is the last guest.)

(The youthful star of 2017, Lim Se Mi)

163
00:05:58.678 --> 00:06:04.417
(Lim Se Mi is the rising star with a unique performance.)

164
00:06:04.751 --> 00:06:05.918
- Please come here. - Okay.

165
00:06:05.918 --> 00:06:07.620
With Se Mi,

166
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.422
we have six female guests.

167
00:06:09.422 --> 00:06:11.157
(We welcome the 6 female partners.)

168
00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:12.492
(He is excited about the couple race.)

169
00:06:12.492 --> 00:06:14.427
Since they are here,

170
00:06:14.427 --> 00:06:17.363
we will have a brief conversation with them.

171
00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:20.066
- Let's keep it brief. - Since we don't have much time,

172
00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:22.602
- we must keep it brief. - It can't be helped today.

173
00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.304
Firstly, we have So Min,

174
00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:27.040
who has joined Running Man for a while now.

175
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.542
- She is the queen of commercials. - She is in all commercials.

176
00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:31.444
It began with gamjatang.

177
00:06:31.444 --> 00:06:32.545
She is in a commercial for ice creams, too.

178
00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:35.081
- She ate gamjatang and ice cream. - She is on her dessert.

179
00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:36.215
(She starts with gamjatang and ends with ice cream.)

180
00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:38.017
What kind of ice cream is it?

181
00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:39.652
Cute and adorable

182
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.921
You don't have to do that.

183
00:06:42.355 --> 00:06:43.990
So Min...

184
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.392
is wearing accessories that match her concept.

185
00:06:46.426 --> 00:06:48.061
- Is this real? Is this gold? - Is it your mother's?

186
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:51.164
These came from scallops in the Pacific Ocean.

187
00:06:51.297 --> 00:06:53.232
- Are those pearls real? - Scallops in the Pacific Ocean?

188
00:06:53.232 --> 00:06:55.268
Pearls don't come from scallops.

189
00:06:55.368 --> 00:06:56.436
Don't they?

190
00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:58.871
Pearls don't come from scallops.

191
00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:01.174
When I came in...

192
00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:03.976
Is this a sewing basket?

193
00:07:04.043 --> 00:07:05.111
This one?

194
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:06.379
Isn't it bundled up tissue paper?

195
00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.181
(Maybe someone crumpled it.)

196
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:09.682
Isn't it a swallow's nest?

197
00:07:09.682 --> 00:07:11.350
- Isn't it a swallow's nest? - Seriously.

198
00:07:11.484 --> 00:07:13.386
Let's stop. Since we don't have much time,

199
00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:15.121
we need to wrap up the conversation.

200
00:07:15.121 --> 00:07:17.056
Ask me more questions.

201
00:07:17.056 --> 00:07:18.491
- Don't you have questions? - With So Min,

202
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:20.793
we started at gamjatang and ended at a swallow's nest.

203
00:07:20.793 --> 00:07:21.961
(They move on without hesitation.)

204
00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:24.330
Please take a step back.

205
00:07:24.564 --> 00:07:26.065
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

206
00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:28.935
- Your purple outfit suits you. - Really?

207
00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:30.303
Why are you wearing a choir uniform?

208
00:07:30.303 --> 00:07:31.637
(This is the Race of Heirs.)

209
00:07:31.637 --> 00:07:32.872
A choir uniform?

210
00:07:32.872 --> 00:07:35.374
- This is an expensive dress. - I could tell...

211
00:07:35.374 --> 00:07:37.410
that it's an expensive dress.

212
00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:38.945
It looks a bit like a school uniform.

213
00:07:38.945 --> 00:07:40.113
She is Annabelle.

214
00:07:40.113 --> 00:07:42.882
- Why do you keep saying that? - Annabelle.

215
00:07:42.882 --> 00:07:44.484
Ji Hyo,

216
00:07:44.684 --> 00:07:46.018
you are full of anger today.

217
00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.854
It seems that way.

218
00:07:47.854 --> 00:07:49.122
She is a bit angry.

219
00:07:49.122 --> 00:07:50.123
(They must watch out for Ji Hyo's anger.)

220
00:07:50.123 --> 00:07:53.126
It has been a while since we heard Ji Hyo shouting.

221
00:07:53.126 --> 00:07:54.527
She sometimes shouts.

222
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:55.995
These days,

223
00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:58.498
I am having a healing time.

224
00:07:58.498 --> 00:08:00.233
- Are you having a healing time? - Yes.

225
00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:01.701
May I ask you why?

226
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:03.136
My schedule is not as busy anymore.

227
00:08:03.136 --> 00:08:04.904
- That's right. - I am taking a break.

228
00:08:05.371 --> 00:08:06.539
It has been a while since I heard her shout.

229
00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:09.175
Both the staff and the members...

230
00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:11.177
- congratulate... - We become nervous.

231
00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:12.779
and fear her...

232
00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:14.547
when she is in a drama.

233
00:08:14.547 --> 00:08:15.681
She becomes sensitive.

234
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:16.949
(They congratulate and fear Ji Hyo when she is in a drama.)

235
00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:19.719
- She becomes sensitive. - That's right.

236
00:08:19.752 --> 00:08:20.853
I guess she isn't in a drama these days.

237
00:08:20.853 --> 00:08:22.255
- Is the shoot over? - Yes, it is.

238
00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:23.689
It's over!

239
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:27.193
(They welcome the peaceful period.)

240
00:08:27.193 --> 00:08:29.929
(I can't believe them.)

241
00:08:29.929 --> 00:08:31.430
- Let's throw a party. - Annabelle.

242
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.132
I won't be as angry today.

243
00:08:33.132 --> 00:08:34.634
- Annabelle. - Now,

244
00:08:34.634 --> 00:08:37.003
she isn't as sensitive.

245
00:08:37.003 --> 00:08:38.504
(The actors can relate to her.)

246
00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:39.872
You can't help but become sensitive when you are in a drama.

247
00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:41.274
- That's right. - Okay.

248
00:08:41.307 --> 00:08:42.875
We have heard enough from Ji Hyo.

249
00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:44.110
- Please stand here. - Song Ji Hyo!

250
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.978
- Next! - Good, good.

251
00:08:45.978 --> 00:08:48.614
It's time to begin the conversation in earnest.

252
00:08:48.614 --> 00:08:50.349
Please welcome Se Mi.

253
00:08:50.349 --> 00:08:51.350
(The third subject is Lim Se Mi.)

254
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.752
She is unique.

255
00:08:52.752 --> 00:08:55.721
I heard that you are friends with So Min.

256
00:08:55.721 --> 00:08:56.923
- That's right. - She is a junior from my school.

257
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.491
She is my senior.

258
00:08:58.491 --> 00:09:00.226
(Their alma mater is Dongduk Women's University.)

259
00:09:00.226 --> 00:09:02.061
- Really? - Did you see each other at school?

260
00:09:02.061 --> 00:09:03.596
- Yes. - I started school at 2005.

261
00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:04.964
- She started school at 2006. - Be honest with us.

262
00:09:04.964 --> 00:09:06.265
How did the others see her?

263
00:09:06.265 --> 00:09:08.267
Tell us honestly.

264
00:09:08.534 --> 00:09:10.570
Tell us honestly.

265
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.905
(What kind of a senior and student...)

266
00:09:12.905 --> 00:09:15.641
(was So Min in her 20s?)

267
00:09:16.843 --> 00:09:20.646
Don't you know she is chatty?

268
00:09:20.646 --> 00:09:21.781
Of course, we know.

269
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:24.050
I thought she would say, "Don't you know she is crazy?"

270
00:09:24.684 --> 00:09:25.785
Seriously.

271
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.655
- That's not what you wanted to say. - No.

272
00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:31.257
Have you drunk with her?

273
00:09:31.257 --> 00:09:32.258
No, I haven't.

274
00:09:32.258 --> 00:09:34.460
- We did it once at a retreat. - That's right.

275
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.762
- Do you have stories? - Did she do something there?

276
00:09:37.563 --> 00:09:39.232
We didn't play games, but received discipline.

277
00:09:39.232 --> 00:09:41.300
(They remember it was customary back in the days.)

278
00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:45.137
- So Min! - I didn't do it.

279
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:46.372
I didn't do it.

280
00:09:46.372 --> 00:09:48.241
Have you received discipline from So Min?

281
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:49.876
No, I haven't.

282
00:09:49.876 --> 00:09:51.577
- I see. - On TV,

283
00:09:51.577 --> 00:09:54.013
she is exactly as how she used to be in school.

284
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.616
Back in school,

285
00:09:56.616 --> 00:09:58.251
I never said anything directly.

286
00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:00.653
I would tell my friend,

287
00:10:00.653 --> 00:10:02.121
"This is what they did."

288
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:04.624
(The professional tattletale)

289
00:10:04.624 --> 00:10:05.625
(I see that So Min was the cause of the discipline.)

290
00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:06.993
What a wicked woman!

291
00:10:06.993 --> 00:10:08.127
- That drives people crazy. - She plays dirty.

292
00:10:08.127 --> 00:10:09.228
She plays dirty.

293
00:10:09.228 --> 00:10:10.730
She drives people up the wall.

294
00:10:11.664 --> 00:10:13.132
- Se Mi is here. - Se Mi!

295
00:10:13.132 --> 00:10:15.001
(They finish the talk with Se Mi, who is reunited So Min.)

296
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:16.369
Next is Ji Min.

297
00:10:16.369 --> 00:10:17.703
Ssan Tina.

298
00:10:17.703 --> 00:10:19.772
- You dressed up the most. - You dressed up like Ssan Tina.

299
00:10:19.772 --> 00:10:21.207
- Really? - These days,

300
00:10:21.207 --> 00:10:24.644
you play a character named Ssan Tina on "Gag Concert".

301
00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:26.712
Is there anything you would like to share?

302
00:10:26.712 --> 00:10:28.147
She is fashionable.

303
00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:30.449
- That's right. - She is interested in fashion.

304
00:10:30.683 --> 00:10:32.151
Why are you wearing a rug?

305
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:33.853
(She gets to the point.)

306
00:10:33.853 --> 00:10:35.521
- A rug? - Don't talk to me that way.

307
00:10:36.022 --> 00:10:37.757
Then I will call it an ugly outfit.

308
00:10:37.757 --> 00:10:38.858
(She corrects herself.)

309
00:10:38.858 --> 00:10:40.159
An ugly outfit.

310
00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:42.228
- A rug! - An ugly outfit.

311
00:10:42.228 --> 00:10:43.629
- It looks cheap. - Yes.

312
00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:44.730
Do you have anything else you want to say?

313
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.233
Why does he always wear this kind of outfits?

314
00:10:47.233 --> 00:10:50.069
(She doesn't understand.)

315
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.904
What's wrong with my outfit?

316
00:10:51.904 --> 00:10:54.240
- What's wrong with my outfit? - It's inappropriate for a shoot.

317
00:10:54.273 --> 00:10:56.242
- Don't I look free-spirited? - He is the owner of a gym.

318
00:10:56.242 --> 00:10:58.711
You have worked with Jong Kook on a program.

319
00:10:58.711 --> 00:10:59.979
What do you think he is like?

320
00:10:59.979 --> 00:11:03.249
I don't know why you are afraid of him.

321
00:11:03.249 --> 00:11:04.750
- Really? - Why do you say that?

322
00:11:04.784 --> 00:11:06.752
Is he soft in other programs?

323
00:11:06.752 --> 00:11:08.521
He is insignificant.

324
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:09.855
- Really? - Insignificant?

325
00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:11.757
- In which program is he like that? - Not many people think that way.

326
00:11:11.757 --> 00:11:14.126
He doesn't complain even when I mistreat him.

327
00:11:14.126 --> 00:11:16.629
He is the only member I mistreat.

328
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:17.830
- You mistreat Jong Kook. - Yes.

329
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.165
I am jealous of you.

330
00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:21.267
You should unfold your arms.

331
00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:22.702
Why?

332
00:11:22.702 --> 00:11:24.003
It suits my outfit.

333
00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:25.237
- You think it suits your outfit? - Yes.

334
00:11:25.237 --> 00:11:26.906
- Would you unfold your arms? - Would it be better? All right.

335
00:11:28.007 --> 00:11:29.675
(He listens to her.)

336
00:11:30.443 --> 00:11:32.745
Jong Kook has changed.

337
00:11:33.312 --> 00:11:35.548
- He is no match to Ji Min. - This is incredible.

338
00:11:36.282 --> 00:11:37.483
(Ji Min's turn ends.)

339
00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:39.585
The next guest is Go Sung Hee.

340
00:11:39.585 --> 00:11:41.020
(The charismatic actress, Go Sung Hee)

341
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.154
(She played a beautiful prosecutor in "While You Were Sleeping".)

342
00:11:42.154 --> 00:11:43.322
"While You Were Sleeping".

343
00:11:43.322 --> 00:11:45.124
"Buy right away"?

344
00:11:45.124 --> 00:11:47.493
What should I buy right away?

345
00:11:47.493 --> 00:11:50.162
- What should I buy right away? - I said "While You Were Sleeping".

346
00:11:50.162 --> 00:11:52.531
I am sorry. To be frank,

347
00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:54.000
no one has watched...

348
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.870
all the episodes of "While You Were Sleeping".

349
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.505
- I am sorry. - They only watched a few episodes.

350
00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:00.773
- I still know who she is. - That's right.

351
00:12:00.773 --> 00:12:02.508
We still know who you are.

352
00:12:02.508 --> 00:12:05.011
She was in "Miss Korea".

353
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:06.145
Really?

354
00:12:06.178 --> 00:12:10.616
(She gave a charismatic performance in "Miss Korea" 4 years ago.)

355
00:12:10.616 --> 00:12:14.020
(Talented actors made many people addicted to "Miss Korea".)

356
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.755
We still know who you are.

357
00:12:15.755 --> 00:12:17.456
- She was in "Miss Korea". - Really?

358
00:12:17.456 --> 00:12:18.758
Did she become Miss Korea?

359
00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:20.159
(You mean the beauty pageant, right?)

360
00:12:20.192 --> 00:12:21.527
Did she become Miss Korea?

361
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:23.662
That's the name of the drama.

362
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.564
Don't say anything.

363
00:12:25.798 --> 00:12:27.266
What is wrong with you?

364
00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:28.367
Don't say anything.

365
00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:29.835
- It's a drama. - I am sorry.

366
00:12:29.835 --> 00:12:30.870
I will work hard.

367
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.505
This is embarrassing.

368
00:12:32.671 --> 00:12:35.775
- He doesn't know anything. - Seok Jin.

369
00:12:35.775 --> 00:12:37.910
This isn't the worst thing Seok Jin has done.

370
00:12:38.044 --> 00:12:39.378
I told you that he called Ariana Grande...

371
00:12:39.378 --> 00:12:40.479
Griana Arande.

372
00:12:40.479 --> 00:12:43.115
(Griana Arande)

373
00:12:43.115 --> 00:12:46.352
- This is nothing. - You aren't Miss Korea.

374
00:12:46.352 --> 00:12:47.853
All right.

375
00:12:47.853 --> 00:12:49.622
How many years ago did you debut?

376
00:12:49.622 --> 00:12:52.224
- About four years. - My goodness.

377
00:12:52.224 --> 00:12:55.628
In four years, you appeared in different dramas.

378
00:12:56.062 --> 00:12:57.630
How many years ago did you debut?

379
00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.765
I debuted 12 years ago.

380
00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:01.133
(The youngest member debuted 12 years.)

381
00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:02.435
It has been many years.

382
00:13:03.169 --> 00:13:04.270
- You were surprised, right? - Yes.

383
00:13:04.537 --> 00:13:07.006
- When did you debut? - 23 years ago.

384
00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:08.074
(Jong Kook is on his 23rd year.)

385
00:13:08.074 --> 00:13:09.241
Kwang Soo, you debuted a while ago.

386
00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:10.376
I debuted 10 years ago.

387
00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:11.544
Are you my junior?

388
00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:15.114
- Are you my junior? - He is.

389
00:13:15.114 --> 00:13:16.715
- You should be polite to me. - He is my junior.

390
00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:18.117
- I debuted 11 years ago. - Wait a minute.

391
00:13:18.117 --> 00:13:19.785
He is my junior.

392
00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:22.021
- I debuted 11 years ago. - Wait a minute.

393
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:23.355
(It looks like Kwang Soo is the youngest member.)

394
00:13:23.355 --> 00:13:24.757
You should have said hello to me.

395
00:13:24.757 --> 00:13:26.092
I said hi.

396
00:13:26.092 --> 00:13:27.493
You should have bowed to me.

397
00:13:27.493 --> 00:13:29.728
- You should call him your senior. - That's right.

398
00:13:29.728 --> 00:13:31.497
Please show some respect.

399
00:13:31.664 --> 00:13:34.934
Seok Jin, aren't you my junior?

400
00:13:34.934 --> 00:13:36.502
- Really? - You are my junior.

401
00:13:36.502 --> 00:13:38.370
- That's right. - He is your immediate junior.

402
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.371
He is your immediate junior.

403
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:40.739
- You are my junior by a year. - I know that.

404
00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:41.774
Treat your senior with respect.

405
00:13:41.774 --> 00:13:43.776
It's embarrassing when you don't do that.

406
00:13:43.943 --> 00:13:45.711
- The thing is, - Pay your respect.

407
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:48.280
he is my senior at work, but my junior at hometown.

408
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.783
- Work comes first. - Hometown doesn't matter.

409
00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:53.285
Since when did you live in Suyu-ri?

410
00:13:53.285 --> 00:13:55.788
(Hold on.)

411
00:13:56.255 --> 00:13:57.490
- Me? - Yes.

412
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.125
(He's flustered.)

413
00:13:59.892 --> 00:14:02.128
(Seok Jin is flustered.)

414
00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:04.230
(Let me think.)

415
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.999
- "Me?" - That was funny.

416
00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:09.235
- When? - It sounds strange.

417
00:14:09.235 --> 00:14:10.536
Since when did you live there?

418
00:14:10.536 --> 00:14:13.272
- Since I was in 8th grade. - I've lived there since 1981.

419
00:14:13.672 --> 00:14:15.107
Does it make you my senior?

420
00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:17.209
You're colleagues.

421
00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:18.777
Say hello to your senior.

422
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:20.980
He didn't live there longer than you.

423
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.515
You lived there for a long time.

424
00:14:22.648 --> 00:14:26.352
As you mentioned, Sung Hee...

425
00:14:26.352 --> 00:14:28.554
- is talented in many ways. - Right.

426
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:31.857
It's easy to tell, isn't it?

427
00:14:32.057 --> 00:14:33.659
- Let's stop here. - Okay.

428
00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:35.094
(He moves on.)

429
00:14:35.094 --> 00:14:36.996
That was great.

430
00:14:36.996 --> 00:14:38.631
- That was good. - Did you see Sung Hee?

431
00:14:38.631 --> 00:14:39.999
She said, "Thank you."

432
00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:41.367
You did it.

433
00:14:41.367 --> 00:14:42.868
- It was enough. - We saw her.

434
00:14:42.868 --> 00:14:45.271
Next is Se Jeong of Gugudan.

435
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:46.605
Hello.

436
00:14:47.273 --> 00:14:49.942
You finally made a comeback with "Chococo".

437
00:14:50.209 --> 00:14:51.377
Right?

438
00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:53.646
- We should look at "Chococo". - Of course.

439
00:14:53.679 --> 00:14:56.148
- That's right. - Please sing "Chococo".

440
00:15:00.386 --> 00:15:01.520
(Hopping)

441
00:15:01.954 --> 00:15:06.392
(Her face is expressionless.)

442
00:15:06.392 --> 00:15:08.694
(She changes completely.)

443
00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:10.763
(She remains expressionless.)

444
00:15:10.763 --> 00:15:13.666
(Then she smiles profusely to promote her album.)

445
00:15:13.933 --> 00:15:16.135
Wait, hold on.

446
00:15:16.135 --> 00:15:19.505
(Though the music stopped, she doesn't stop smiling.)

447
00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:21.006
- What was that? - It was too much.

448
00:15:21.006 --> 00:15:23.242
- It was mechanical. - She should be somewhat shy.

449
00:15:23.242 --> 00:15:25.110
- I thought she was a robot. - You should act shyly.

450
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.412
- What was that? - You startled me.

451
00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:28.147
She should take more time,

452
00:15:28.214 --> 00:15:30.549
but she instantly moved like this.

453
00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:32.284
She started immediately.

454
00:15:33.285 --> 00:15:35.521
- Can you do it again, Se Jeong? - Yes.

455
00:15:35.521 --> 00:15:36.755
Please do it again.

456
00:15:36.755 --> 00:15:38.357
- It'll be the same. - Really?

457
00:15:38.357 --> 00:15:40.259
- Of course. - It will be different.

458
00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:41.594
We talked about it.

459
00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:45.331
She's like a machine.

460
00:15:45.331 --> 00:15:46.365
(She transforms into a public relations robot.)

461
00:15:46.365 --> 00:15:48.367
Look at her facial expression.

462
00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:51.270
Her facial expression is the same.

463
00:15:51.937 --> 00:15:56.175
(It's a perfect public relations robot.)

464
00:15:56.508 --> 00:15:58.877
- Look at her. - My goodness.

465
00:15:58.877 --> 00:16:00.246
(They're impressed.)

466
00:16:00.246 --> 00:16:01.914
- She's like a machine. - She's impressive.

467
00:16:01.914 --> 00:16:03.749
She's exactly the same.

468
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.485
(She continues to promote her album.)

469
00:16:06.485 --> 00:16:08.621
It doesn't matter what happens around her.

470
00:16:08.621 --> 00:16:10.623
- You're right. - Let's see.

471
00:16:10.623 --> 00:16:13.125
- This is how it starts. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

472
00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:15.661
- Chococo - Chococo

473
00:16:15.661 --> 00:16:17.496
She turns her hands a lot.

474
00:16:17.496 --> 00:16:19.164
(They start the race.)

475
00:16:19.164 --> 00:16:22.835
With Running Airline's inheritance on the line,

476
00:16:22.835 --> 00:16:25.904
the race is called Crisis of the Family, Return of Heiress.

477
00:16:25.904 --> 00:16:27.573
(Return of Heiress)

478
00:16:27.573 --> 00:16:28.774
I'll take it.

479
00:16:28.774 --> 00:16:30.776
It's mine.

480
00:16:30.943 --> 00:16:34.747
The male members' rank is determined from 1st to 6th.

481
00:16:34.747 --> 00:16:37.149
When the female members pair up with the male members,

482
00:16:37.149 --> 00:16:41.854
their ranks will be the same as their partners'.

483
00:16:42.354 --> 00:16:43.389
Okay.

484
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:44.790
They should choose carefully.

485
00:16:44.923 --> 00:16:46.558
It'll be good to be my partner.

486
00:16:46.592 --> 00:16:48.027
At the end of the final race,

487
00:16:48.027 --> 00:16:50.763
the surviving couple with the highest rank wins.

488
00:16:50.763 --> 00:16:56.635
You'll receive a huge amount of inheritance from the chairman.

489
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.105
By the way,

490
00:17:00.105 --> 00:17:01.907
Kwon Ryeol...

491
00:17:02.074 --> 00:17:04.243
- is professional after all. - Why?

492
00:17:04.243 --> 00:17:06.779
(What makes him professional?)

493
00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:10.549
Other directors shoot while standing behind or next to the camera.

494
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:12.351
This is what Kwon Ryeol does.

495
00:17:13.719 --> 00:17:18.724
(As a professional, he's very relaxed.)

496
00:17:18.824 --> 00:17:20.125
He's acting like an audience.

497
00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.394
- He's one of the viewers. - He's part of the audience.

498
00:17:22.594 --> 00:17:24.897
Why are you grabbing the camera?

499
00:17:25.064 --> 00:17:26.465
(He suddenly becomes serious.)

500
00:17:26.465 --> 00:17:28.901
Now, he's starting to work.

501
00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:31.570
One of the female members...

502
00:17:31.603 --> 00:17:34.673
is the chairman's long-lost, youngest daughter.

503
00:17:35.407 --> 00:17:40.112
(Is one of them the chairman's long-lost daughter?)

504
00:17:40.112 --> 00:17:42.614
At the final race, regardless of her rank,

505
00:17:42.614 --> 00:17:44.917
the youngest daughter may eliminate any of her brothers.

506
00:17:45.751 --> 00:17:47.653
She may eliminate her brothers.

507
00:17:47.653 --> 00:17:51.590
If she's the final heir's partner and keeps her identity a secret,

508
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.859
she'll be the only winner.

509
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.795
We can be partners with the youngest daughter.

510
00:17:56.862 --> 00:17:58.297
Those who lose will be penalized with...

511
00:17:58.297 --> 00:18:01.900
- a humiliating airport fashion. - Airport fashion?

512
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.802
How can that be a penalty?

513
00:18:05.104 --> 00:18:06.305
No, what's that?

514
00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:07.740
Do we have to wear that at the airport?

515
00:18:08.073 --> 00:18:10.042
Don't these belong to Kyung Mi?

516
00:18:10.042 --> 00:18:13.579
(Airport outfit for celebrities)

517
00:18:14.747 --> 00:18:18.817
(The bright, natural colors make celebrities stand out.)

518
00:18:19.084 --> 00:18:21.754
(Unique materials make a statement of their own.)

519
00:18:22.554 --> 00:18:25.023
These outfits would make you look big.

520
00:18:25.023 --> 00:18:26.959
- This is the best. - It is.

521
00:18:26.959 --> 00:18:28.594
- We're choosing one. - Don't you know?

522
00:18:28.594 --> 00:18:29.862
- It's... - This is the best.

523
00:18:29.862 --> 00:18:31.764
better to wear something that completely stands out.

524
00:18:31.764 --> 00:18:34.199
Otherwise, people think that's your real sense of fashion.

525
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.335
- Do you know what I mean? - Yes.

526
00:18:36.335 --> 00:18:37.970
It's better to stand out completely.

527
00:18:38.036 --> 00:18:41.073
Hints about your partner's rank and the youngest daughter...

528
00:18:41.073 --> 00:18:44.810
will be given during missions. Please do your best.

529
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.613
Let's pair up.

530
00:18:47.613 --> 00:18:49.181
Here's how.

531
00:18:49.181 --> 00:18:51.884
You'll choose your partner in an instant.

532
00:18:51.884 --> 00:18:54.119
It's called Love That Transcends a Wall.

533
00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:55.921
(Love That Transcends a Wall)

534
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:57.356
- A wall? - A wall.

535
00:18:57.356 --> 00:18:58.590
There must be a wall.

536
00:18:58.791 --> 00:19:01.160
Male and female members will stand in a line...

537
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.629
with a wall between them.

538
00:19:03.629 --> 00:19:07.032
When the music plays, the first person in each line will dance.

539
00:19:07.032 --> 00:19:08.934
They'll see who their partner is.

540
00:19:09.034 --> 00:19:12.371
When the whistle blows, you must choose either left, right, or up...

541
00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:13.672
and stick out your face.

542
00:19:13.705 --> 00:19:15.674
If you choose the same direction, you become partners.

543
00:19:15.741 --> 00:19:18.310
If not, the two will go to the back of the line.

544
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.446
They'll try again.

545
00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.048
It's until you get paired up.

546
00:19:23.048 --> 00:19:24.850
Determine the order,

547
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:26.185
and stand in a line.

548
00:19:26.618 --> 00:19:27.719
(Shall I go first?)

549
00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:29.655
- Good. - How shall we stand?

550
00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:31.423
- Stand wherever you want. - They can't know.

551
00:19:31.423 --> 00:19:33.058
We can stand wherever we want.

552
00:19:33.058 --> 00:19:34.793
- Right. - Let's stand wherever we want.

553
00:19:34.793 --> 00:19:35.894
(The order is random.)

554
00:19:36.128 --> 00:19:38.464
Listen, everyone.

555
00:19:38.797 --> 00:19:40.699
This might be helpful.

556
00:19:44.069 --> 00:19:47.739
(Ji Hyo is behind the wall.)

557
00:19:48.373 --> 00:19:49.808
(He's startled.)

558
00:19:49.808 --> 00:19:52.144
Why did you look?

559
00:19:52.144 --> 00:19:54.313
I was startled. She looked scary.

560
00:19:54.379 --> 00:19:55.714
You can't look.

561
00:19:55.714 --> 00:19:57.382
Did you decide the order already?

562
00:19:57.382 --> 00:19:58.684
- We didn't yet. - You didn't?

563
00:19:59.051 --> 00:20:01.220
(They're still worried.)

564
00:20:02.955 --> 00:20:05.891
Let me tell you just in case.

565
00:20:05.891 --> 00:20:08.694
(Kwang Soo, be the 1st player.)

566
00:20:09.761 --> 00:20:11.363
It's a dud from the start.

567
00:20:11.363 --> 00:20:13.799
What do you mean? The order will change.

568
00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:15.133
We didn't decide the order yet.

569
00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:16.468
- Right? - Right.

570
00:20:16.502 --> 00:20:17.636
Go, Haha.

571
00:20:17.636 --> 00:20:19.204
(Haha is the 1st player.)

572
00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:20.672
Come here.

573
00:20:21.073 --> 00:20:23.842
- Stand in the back. - Really?

574
00:20:23.842 --> 00:20:25.711
We don't know who it will be.

575
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:26.812
Let's go.

576
00:20:29.114 --> 00:20:32.851
(His groove is good enough to seduce women.)

577
00:20:36.021 --> 00:20:37.256
(Darn it.)

578
00:20:38.557 --> 00:20:42.694
(Ji Hyo is right behind his back.)

579
00:20:42.694 --> 00:20:44.463
Act excited.

580
00:20:44.463 --> 00:20:45.464
Be excited.

581
00:20:45.464 --> 00:20:47.165
(He knew something bad was coming.)

582
00:20:48.367 --> 00:20:50.269
Be excited. Smile more.

583
00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:51.336
(It's a horror groove.)

584
00:20:51.336 --> 00:20:53.639
- Stand behind the wall. - You may not be paired up.

585
00:20:53.639 --> 00:20:54.873
You may not be paired up.

586
00:20:54.873 --> 00:20:56.441
You never know.

587
00:20:56.608 --> 00:20:58.143
1, 2.

588
00:20:58.143 --> 00:20:59.444
Left, right, or up.

589
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.650
(Don't move to my right.)

590
00:21:07.152 --> 00:21:10.022
(He wanted to be partners with a guest.)

591
00:21:10.022 --> 00:21:12.424
Let's go. Let's celebrate.

592
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:17.462
(As they say goodbye to Ji Hyo, they celebrate.)

593
00:21:19.464 --> 00:21:21.800
Didn't she move a little late?

594
00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:24.069
Isn't it problematic?

595
00:21:24.069 --> 00:21:25.671
It's because I chose you.

596
00:21:25.671 --> 00:21:29.775
(It's because I chose you.)

597
00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:31.376
- Come here. - Why?

598
00:21:31.376 --> 00:21:33.645
Ji Hyo and Haha are partners.

599
00:21:34.479 --> 00:21:36.081
I don't want to play.

600
00:21:39.051 --> 00:21:42.020
It's Seventeen.

601
00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.288
(He feels very nice today.)

602
00:21:43.288 --> 00:21:44.356
Nice.

603
00:21:46.758 --> 00:21:52.497
(He returns to his place as if nothing happened.)

604
00:21:54.199 --> 00:21:57.235
(They don't care about each other, but they meet again.)

605
00:21:57.703 --> 00:22:00.472
(You can't go anywhere.)

606
00:22:02.541 --> 00:22:03.709
Are you angry?

607
00:22:03.709 --> 00:22:04.843
(Accept the reality.)

608
00:22:06.945 --> 00:22:08.146
Go out.

609
00:22:08.146 --> 00:22:10.115
(They don't care anymore.)

610
00:22:10.115 --> 00:22:11.617
Kwang Soo is funny.

611
00:22:12.451 --> 00:22:13.885
It's Kwang Soo.

612
00:22:13.885 --> 00:22:15.120
This is funny.

613
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.288
Now.

614
00:22:16.288 --> 00:22:17.856
- Go behind the wall. - Go.

615
00:22:18.523 --> 00:22:20.392
Most people choose the right.

616
00:22:20.392 --> 00:22:23.829
(Will they be partners again?)

617
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.366
(We can't be partners.)

618
00:22:27.366 --> 00:22:30.135
(He stands on tiptoe to avoid being her partner.)

619
00:22:30.135 --> 00:22:32.137
- They aren't partners. Who's next? - They aren't?

620
00:22:32.337 --> 00:22:34.373
(His defense was successful.)

621
00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:38.810
It's "Go Go".

622
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.179
(Sung Hee is in front of the line.)

623
00:22:41.713 --> 00:22:43.115
It's not bad.

624
00:22:43.115 --> 00:22:44.182
(The next player isn't bad.)

625
00:22:44.182 --> 00:22:45.217
(Full of expectations)

626
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.155
(My goodness)

627
00:22:51.056 --> 00:22:52.824
(Her mood changes...)

628
00:22:52.824 --> 00:22:55.494
(after she sees what's behind the wall.)

629
00:22:56.895 --> 00:22:59.364
(What do I do now?)

630
00:22:59.564 --> 00:23:02.734
She's blushing.

631
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:06.138
Goodness, she's blushing.

632
00:23:06.138 --> 00:23:07.172
Look.

633
00:23:07.172 --> 00:23:08.240
(She's flustered.)

634
00:23:10.642 --> 00:23:12.577
(Sighing)

635
00:23:12.878 --> 00:23:15.080
How can she make that face in front of him?

636
00:23:15.313 --> 00:23:16.381
Come back.

637
00:23:16.381 --> 00:23:18.483
- How could she? - Sung Hee.

638
00:23:18.483 --> 00:23:19.951
You only have one chance.

639
00:23:20.018 --> 00:23:21.586
Move to this side.

640
00:23:21.586 --> 00:23:23.922
Stand behind the wall.

641
00:23:23.922 --> 00:23:27.125
1, 2, 1, 2, 3.

642
00:23:27.125 --> 00:23:29.494
(Please spare me from this situation.)

643
00:23:30.629 --> 00:23:33.699
(Seok Jin looks to his right.)

644
00:23:34.266 --> 00:23:36.902
(Sung Hee is in the air.)

645
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.440
(She jumps with all her might.)

646
00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:44.342
It was simultaneous.

647
00:23:44.342 --> 00:23:46.311
Go back in line.

648
00:23:46.511 --> 00:23:50.615
(Yes, it was a success.)

649
00:23:51.349 --> 00:23:54.720
Don't you like us?

650
00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:55.921
It's not that.

651
00:23:55.921 --> 00:23:57.622
She looks so annoyed.

652
00:23:57.622 --> 00:24:01.359
She bowed even before the music stopped.

653
00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:04.696
(She said goodbye before the music stopped.)

654
00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:05.831
You don't like us?

655
00:24:06.164 --> 00:24:08.400
Next. Wait, and see.

656
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.434
(You humiliated me.)

657
00:24:10.335 --> 00:24:11.870
(Who is Jae Seok's partner?)

658
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.139
- "Likey". - Yu Jae Seok.

659
00:24:14.473 --> 00:24:16.141
(The girl in white, Se Mi)

660
00:24:16.141 --> 00:24:17.342
- It's Se Mi. - Se Mi.

661
00:24:17.743 --> 00:24:19.745
- You're a good dancer. - What?

662
00:24:20.545 --> 00:24:21.613
(Dancing)

663
00:24:21.613 --> 00:24:23.081
Look at Jae Seok.

664
00:24:24.316 --> 00:24:25.617
Hold on.

665
00:24:25.617 --> 00:24:27.385
Stop. I mean...

666
00:24:27.819 --> 00:24:29.955
The song is new,

667
00:24:30.055 --> 00:24:33.358
but his dance is from the "X-Man" days.

668
00:24:33.358 --> 00:24:35.861
(He dances like in the old days.)

669
00:24:35.861 --> 00:24:38.964
- What's that? - Be quiet.

670
00:24:38.964 --> 00:24:39.965
(Shameless)

671
00:24:39.965 --> 00:24:41.867
- What's that? - Se Mi and I were having fun.

672
00:24:41.867 --> 00:24:44.436
- Show us a new dance. - Fine.

673
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:46.271
- Se Mi, let's do it again. - New dance?

674
00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:47.472
- Do you know this song? - Yes.

675
00:24:47.472 --> 00:24:49.441
- Okay. - "Likey".

676
00:24:49.441 --> 00:24:51.143
(Will Jae Seok pull off this dance?)

677
00:24:51.143 --> 00:24:54.646
I'll copy Twice's dance exactly.

678
00:24:55.113 --> 00:24:56.681
He'll copy their dance.

679
00:24:56.681 --> 00:24:57.949
1, 2, 3, 4.

680
00:24:57.949 --> 00:25:01.153
(The highlights of "Likey" dance)

681
00:25:01.419 --> 00:25:02.487
3, 4.

682
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:04.790
What's that?

683
00:25:05.123 --> 00:25:07.292
That's just Jae Seok.

684
00:25:07.292 --> 00:25:08.560
That's an old dance.

685
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.630
(It's not like Twice at all.)

686
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.265
- That's your old dance. - When did Twice dance like that?

687
00:25:13.265 --> 00:25:14.466
Twice didn't...

688
00:25:14.466 --> 00:25:16.701
That's your old dance.

689
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:18.303
(He shows another dance from the old days.)

690
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.539
Decide now.

691
00:25:20.539 --> 00:25:22.440
(Jae Seok is even affecting Se Mi.)

692
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.809
- Good. - Decide now.

693
00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:26.044
We hit it off.

694
00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:32.184
(They hit it off, but will they become a team?)

695
00:25:33.385 --> 00:25:37.422
(Good to see you.)

696
00:25:38.323 --> 00:25:39.424
Nice.

697
00:25:39.558 --> 00:25:40.692
(Jealous)

698
00:25:40.692 --> 00:25:42.627
- Old-fashioned people. - I'm so happy.

699
00:25:43.094 --> 00:25:46.998
- There's an unspoken rule. - I love it.

700
00:25:47.232 --> 00:25:48.867
If you like your partner, you come out here.

701
00:25:49.568 --> 00:25:50.902
It's a rule.

702
00:25:50.969 --> 00:25:52.838
- If you like your partner, here. - If you don't, you jump.

703
00:25:52.838 --> 00:25:54.206
If you don't like your partner, you jump.

704
00:25:54.206 --> 00:25:55.507
You jump.

705
00:25:57.242 --> 00:26:02.214
(It was obvious.)

706
00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:06.418
The cameras are here, so you come out here if you like your partner.

707
00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:09.387
If you don't... Song Yi, you...

708
00:26:09.554 --> 00:26:12.624
It's Sung Hee.

709
00:26:12.624 --> 00:26:13.625
Not Song Yi.

710
00:26:13.625 --> 00:26:14.659
Let's make it, Song Yi.

711
00:26:14.659 --> 00:26:16.528
That's a name of a mushroom.

712
00:26:16.528 --> 00:26:17.529
(She turned into a mushroom.)

713
00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:18.830
It's Sung Hee.

714
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.399
Everyone, you don't have to line up anymore.

715
00:26:21.633 --> 00:26:25.103
Just dance to the music, and decide your partner.

716
00:26:25.103 --> 00:26:26.371
- Okay. - Let's start.

717
00:26:26.504 --> 00:26:27.606
Seok Jin.

718
00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:30.609
If you want to become a couple with someone,

719
00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:31.810
send a signal.

720
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:33.645
(Sung Hee, come here.)

721
00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:35.814
Sung Hee.

722
00:26:35.814 --> 00:26:36.848
(Turning)

723
00:26:38.183 --> 00:26:41.987
(Sung Hee runs away.)

724
00:26:42.888 --> 00:26:45.390
(Seok Jin chases.)

725
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.825
I feel sorry for him.

726
00:26:46.825 --> 00:26:49.361
(The Chase of Love)

727
00:26:49.361 --> 00:26:51.162
Come back in.

728
00:26:51.196 --> 00:26:52.631
You don't know who would be standing in front of you.

729
00:26:52.764 --> 00:26:54.232
Please lower your head.

730
00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:57.903
1, 2, 3.

731
00:26:59.204 --> 00:27:00.338
Three.

732
00:27:01.907 --> 00:27:05.710
(It's destiny.)

733
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:09.414
(Tiger Moth Couple)

734
00:27:09.414 --> 00:27:10.415
Nice.

735
00:27:10.415 --> 00:27:11.917
(They wanted to avoid each other.)

736
00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:16.655
(Jae Seok is celebrating.)

737
00:27:18.056 --> 00:27:20.492
Who would be the chairman's daughter?

738
00:27:23.128 --> 00:27:24.529
- So suddenly? - So suddenly?

739
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:26.631
- That's so random. - Let's have some fun.

740
00:27:26.631 --> 00:27:28.133
- What's with you? - It's not just his daughter.

741
00:27:28.133 --> 00:27:30.402
- The chairman's youngest daughter. - The chairman's daughter...

742
00:27:30.402 --> 00:27:32.404
You shot Sung Hee earlier.

743
00:27:34.306 --> 00:27:36.374
- "Really Really". - You know this dance, right?

744
00:27:36.508 --> 00:27:37.642
You should know.

745
00:27:38.009 --> 00:27:40.178
I'll show you.

746
00:27:40.178 --> 00:27:41.413
(This is the newest dance.)

747
00:27:41.413 --> 00:27:42.447
What's that?

748
00:27:42.614 --> 00:27:44.115
This is the newest dance.

749
00:27:44.616 --> 00:27:46.618
- That's "Macarena". - That's "Macarena".

750
00:27:47.385 --> 00:27:49.154
- Come out. - Where are you?

751
00:27:49.387 --> 00:27:50.889
(I'm here, Se Chan.)

752
00:27:50.889 --> 00:27:52.857
What's going on?

753
00:27:53.024 --> 00:27:55.827
Se Jeong wants to dance with Se Chan.

754
00:27:55.827 --> 00:27:56.962
It's perfect now.

755
00:27:56.962 --> 00:27:58.296
Please go back in.

756
00:27:58.296 --> 00:28:00.899
(I choose you.)

757
00:28:00.899 --> 00:28:01.933
Please go back in.

758
00:28:02.567 --> 00:28:03.635
It's so funny.

759
00:28:03.635 --> 00:28:06.705
1, 2, 3.

760
00:28:06.705 --> 00:28:08.807
(Will Se Jeong come out on the right side too?)

761
00:28:08.807 --> 00:28:12.243
(Se Chan and Se Jeong are a team.)

762
00:28:13.511 --> 00:28:14.646
I'm getting scared.

763
00:28:16.114 --> 00:28:17.282
(It's a 50-50 chance now.)

764
00:28:17.282 --> 00:28:18.883
I'm scared.

765
00:28:19.284 --> 00:28:24.189
Sung Hee is facing the biggest crisis since her debut.

766
00:28:24.656 --> 00:28:26.624
- And... - A mission in the mission.

767
00:28:26.624 --> 00:28:28.893
If you go against the flow, you'll be punished.

768
00:28:29.027 --> 00:28:31.029
Please play the music.

769
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:34.532
(The 50-50 chance matching starts.)

770
00:28:34.532 --> 00:28:36.001
(It's "Chococo".)

771
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:37.002
It's "Chococo".

772
00:28:37.302 --> 00:28:39.104
Look at Ji Min.

773
00:28:39.571 --> 00:28:41.806
Ji Min is so aggressive.

774
00:28:41.806 --> 00:28:44.409
Sung Hee still has a chance.

775
00:28:44.409 --> 00:28:47.078
Sung Hee is supporting Ji Min.

776
00:28:47.078 --> 00:28:48.413
(Way to go, Ji Min.)

777
00:28:49.814 --> 00:28:52.550
- Let's go back in. - No, wait for the chorus.

778
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.586
(Wait for the chorus.)

779
00:28:54.586 --> 00:28:56.721
Wait for the chorus.

780
00:28:56.721 --> 00:28:58.723
- What? - Is this your song?

781
00:28:58.723 --> 00:29:01.292
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - How do you do it?

782
00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:03.228
(Everyone, dance along.)

783
00:29:04.062 --> 00:29:06.398
(Look cute.)

784
00:29:07.198 --> 00:29:08.633
(They all dance along without knowing why.)

785
00:29:08.633 --> 00:29:09.734
Why are we doing this?

786
00:29:10.135 --> 00:29:12.470
(Jong Kook is dancing along too.)

787
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.973
- Thank you. - Okay.

788
00:29:15.473 --> 00:29:17.809
- You do it like this. - No, it's like this.

789
00:29:17.809 --> 00:29:18.910
No, you have to shake it.

790
00:29:19.144 --> 00:29:22.480
1, 2, 3.

791
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.082
(It's time to decide the teams.)

792
00:29:24.082 --> 00:29:29.254
(Who will be Ji Min's partner? Seok Jin or Jong Kook?)

793
00:29:29.954 --> 00:29:31.056
Three.

794
00:29:31.356 --> 00:29:32.457
(Disappointed)

795
00:29:32.824 --> 00:29:33.925
Three.

796
00:29:34.092 --> 00:29:37.195
(The enemies, Jong Kook and Ji Min, become a team.)

797
00:29:38.329 --> 00:29:39.464
Sung Hee.

798
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:43.668
(Seok Jin and Sung Hee become a team.)

799
00:29:44.202 --> 00:29:45.537
- Let's do this. - All right.

800
00:29:45.537 --> 00:29:47.472
Jong Kook and Ji Min.

801
00:29:47.472 --> 00:29:49.340
Seok Jin and Sung Hee.

802
00:29:49.574 --> 00:29:50.975
You never know.

803
00:29:50.975 --> 00:29:52.677
- Give me another chance. - No.

804
00:29:52.944 --> 00:29:54.279
- You don't know yet. - You didn't lose.

805
00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:56.014
(Couples)

806
00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.351
- I'm so honored. - Really.

807
00:30:00.351 --> 00:30:02.320
- Not everyone gets to be here. - No.

808
00:30:02.854 --> 00:30:03.888
Those are real runways.

809
00:30:03.888 --> 00:30:06.324
(The airport apron is where planes are parked between flights.)

810
00:30:07.058 --> 00:30:10.028
(The next mission will be carried out here.)

811
00:30:10.028 --> 00:30:12.063
When will we get to be here again?

812
00:30:12.063 --> 00:30:13.765
I'd love to run to the other side.

813
00:30:13.765 --> 00:30:16.434
- Like crazy. - Yes, like crazy.

814
00:30:16.434 --> 00:30:17.469
(What mission will they carry out?)

815
00:30:17.469 --> 00:30:18.703
It looks amazing.

816
00:30:20.004 --> 00:30:24.109
The first couple mission is Talent Bingo.

817
00:30:24.109 --> 00:30:26.544
(Talent Bingo)

818
00:30:26.544 --> 00:30:28.113
I see runways.

819
00:30:28.313 --> 00:30:32.150
You just play a little game with your partner...

820
00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.319
and go home.

821
00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:36.087
- That's it. - We're cool.

822
00:30:36.154 --> 00:30:38.623
A moment ago, Kwang Soo told...

823
00:30:38.623 --> 00:30:41.693
Sung Hee he wanted to become friends with her.

824
00:30:41.693 --> 00:30:43.428
(Kwang Soo wants to become friends with her.)

825
00:30:43.428 --> 00:30:46.264
- My goodness. - It's his way of living.

826
00:30:46.397 --> 00:30:48.700
Take care of So Min.

827
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.068
Take care of me.

828
00:30:50.301 --> 00:30:51.402
(Hurt)

829
00:30:51.402 --> 00:30:53.938
So Min, I'm sorry,

830
00:30:53.938 --> 00:30:55.640
but don't act like his girlfriend.

831
00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.443
(Don't act like Kwang Soo's girlfriend.)

832
00:30:59.244 --> 00:31:00.879
They look like newly-weds.

833
00:31:00.879 --> 00:31:02.347
You were like...

834
00:31:02.747 --> 00:31:05.717
(She looked hurt.)

835
00:31:06.384 --> 00:31:08.319
- You're not his girlfriend. - Me?

836
00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:11.422
I was just looking at that sketchbook.

837
00:31:11.422 --> 00:31:13.358
I was so surprised.

838
00:31:13.458 --> 00:31:19.130
(While Kwang Soo and So Min are bickering...)

839
00:31:20.365 --> 00:31:23.168
By the way, I'm a bit hurt.

840
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:26.905
I'm wearing mine on my neck, but she has it around her ankle.

841
00:31:26.905 --> 00:31:30.441
(Seok Jin is wearing it around his neck but not her.)

842
00:31:31.075 --> 00:31:32.911
- This is not a sauna. - She's hiding it.

843
00:31:32.911 --> 00:31:35.180
Why would you wear it around your ankle?

844
00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.414
You can't see it.

845
00:31:36.814 --> 00:31:39.384
Weren't you supposed to discuss it with me?

846
00:31:39.384 --> 00:31:41.352
She doesn't want to be a team with you.

847
00:31:41.352 --> 00:31:43.521
I don't think she put it around her ankle from the beginning.

848
00:31:43.521 --> 00:31:46.324
She probably saw Seok Jin and thought, "Gosh, I hate him."

849
00:31:46.324 --> 00:31:47.625
(And then she put it around her ankle.)

850
00:31:47.625 --> 00:31:48.860
(That's not true.)

851
00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.228
She didn't want it to show.

852
00:31:50.228 --> 00:31:54.065
I've been observing her, and she's not easy.

853
00:31:54.465 --> 00:31:57.702
Let's start the first couple mission.

854
00:31:58.269 --> 00:32:01.639
We asked our guests what talents they have.

855
00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:03.675
Their answers are written on the papers on the table.

856
00:32:04.108 --> 00:32:06.611
If you preserve your talent, you'll get one sticker.

857
00:32:06.878 --> 00:32:10.014
If you take someone else's talent away, you'll get two stickers.

858
00:32:10.281 --> 00:32:13.151
The first team who completes a row will win.

859
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:16.087
The winners can find out both the rank of a chosen member...

860
00:32:16.087 --> 00:32:17.889
and a hint about the youngest daughter.

861
00:32:17.889 --> 00:32:24.395
(The rank of a chosen member and a hint about the daughter)

862
00:32:24.562 --> 00:32:28.399
The team who finishes 2nd can choose between the 2.

863
00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:29.400
- Okay. - Okay.

864
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.170
(The team who finishes 2nd will get one of the 2 rewards.)

865
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.606
All right. Sung Hee,

866
00:32:34.606 --> 00:32:36.107
- please choose one. - Choose one.

867
00:32:36.107 --> 00:32:37.375
(Sung Hee chooses the first talent.)

868
00:32:37.375 --> 00:32:38.409
What is it?

869
00:32:38.409 --> 00:32:41.913
(What is the first talent?)

870
00:32:42.313 --> 00:32:43.881
- Who is it? - Double unders?

871
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:45.583
- It must be Ji Hyo. - What's double unders?

872
00:32:45.583 --> 00:32:47.252
- Jumping rope. - Jumping rope.

873
00:32:47.752 --> 00:32:49.254
Whose talent is it?

874
00:32:50.255 --> 00:32:51.322
Me.

875
00:32:51.322 --> 00:32:53.891
(It's your partner's, Jae Seok.)

876
00:32:53.891 --> 00:32:55.660
- Really? - Really?

877
00:32:56.294 --> 00:33:00.965
(Double unders)

878
00:33:00.965 --> 00:33:03.835
- How many can you do? - In a row?

879
00:33:03.835 --> 00:33:05.470
I'm not sure. I haven't done it in a while.

880
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.905
- Okay. - When was the last time?

881
00:33:07.905 --> 00:33:09.807
- Sorry? - When did you do it last?

882
00:33:09.874 --> 00:33:11.609
It was last year.

883
00:33:11.609 --> 00:33:13.411
- Last year? - That's a problem.

884
00:33:13.411 --> 00:33:14.545
(Last year)

885
00:33:14.545 --> 00:33:15.613
It's fun.

886
00:33:15.613 --> 00:33:17.081
My goodness.

887
00:33:17.815 --> 00:33:19.550
- Everyone. - What should I do?

888
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.019
(Will Se Mi prove her talent?)

889
00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:22.920
Practice first, Se Mi.

890
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.055
(Se Mi starts practicing.)

891
00:33:24.622 --> 00:33:26.958
She's good. There you go.

892
00:33:26.958 --> 00:33:28.059
Se Mi.

893
00:33:29.227 --> 00:33:32.130
You're good. That's enough.

894
00:33:32.397 --> 00:33:35.533
(It's not bad, right?)

895
00:33:35.533 --> 00:33:36.634
You're good.

896
00:33:36.634 --> 00:33:38.169
Wasn't that just a single under?

897
00:33:38.169 --> 00:33:39.904
They were double unders.

898
00:33:39.904 --> 00:33:40.905
Look at this.

899
00:33:40.905 --> 00:33:43.107
(They were double unders.)

900
00:33:43.107 --> 00:33:44.942
- It was double unders. - No.

901
00:33:44.942 --> 00:33:46.878
It was one and a half.

902
00:33:46.878 --> 00:33:47.945
Hold on.

903
00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:51.015
How do you do one and a half?

904
00:33:51.015 --> 00:33:53.451
(Explain how you do one and a half.)

905
00:33:53.451 --> 00:33:55.320
- What? - How do you do it?

906
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.421
So this is one under.

907
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:57.689
How would you do one and a half?

908
00:33:57.689 --> 00:33:58.890
(Please elaborate.)

909
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.391
My gosh, you're inquisitive.

910
00:34:00.391 --> 00:34:02.527
(He's frustrated.)

911
00:34:02.527 --> 00:34:03.861
- I'm older than you. - Wait.

912
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:05.296
- Does such technique exists? - Jong Kook is right on that.

913
00:34:05.296 --> 00:34:06.864
How can someone do one and a half under?

914
00:34:06.864 --> 00:34:08.099
(Seok Jin keeps his silence.)

915
00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:09.334
I'm serious.

916
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.135
- It's either single or double. - Hey.

917
00:34:11.135 --> 00:34:12.904
- I guess there's no such thing. - You bet there isn't.

918
00:34:12.904 --> 00:34:14.105
- Try it. - Show us.

919
00:34:14.672 --> 00:34:16.708
This is the double under my partner will try.

920
00:34:16.708 --> 00:34:18.076
- Observe. - Let's go.

921
00:34:18.076 --> 00:34:20.144
- She's going to do it, right? - This is going to count.

922
00:34:20.144 --> 00:34:22.280
- Take your time. Do it one by one. - Start.

923
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.414
That was one.

924
00:34:23.414 --> 00:34:25.450
- Start. - That was one.

925
00:34:26.384 --> 00:34:27.719
She's good. She's great.

926
00:34:27.885 --> 00:34:29.354
She is indeed.

927
00:34:29.954 --> 00:34:31.089
9, 10.

928
00:34:31.089 --> 00:34:32.990
How can we beat her? She's amazing at it.

929
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:34.525
- She's unbelievable. - She's fantastic.

930
00:34:34.826 --> 00:34:36.527
- She's too good. - I'm about to pass out.

931
00:34:36.828 --> 00:34:39.430
- 21, 22, 23, 24, - Se Mi.

932
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:40.698
- 25, 25, 27... - I can't do it anymore.

933
00:34:40.698 --> 00:34:42.166
- That's enough! - That was excellent.

934
00:34:42.166 --> 00:34:44.035
(She stops.)

935
00:34:44.035 --> 00:34:45.303
Well done!

936
00:34:45.503 --> 00:34:47.038
You're amazing!

937
00:34:47.038 --> 00:34:48.272
You were so good.

938
00:34:48.406 --> 00:34:50.408
- You were really good. - That was great.

939
00:34:50.408 --> 00:34:53.044
(Se Mi's rope jump skill is amazing.)

940
00:34:54.045 --> 00:34:55.680
She's too good at it.

941
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.683
Anyone who wants to challenge her for the double unders, go ahead.

942
00:34:58.683 --> 00:35:01.919
If there's no one, we'll take the sticker right away.

943
00:35:01.919 --> 00:35:03.454
(Jae Seok is rubbing it in.)

944
00:35:03.454 --> 00:35:06.391
(Go, Kwang Soo! She pushes him forward.)

945
00:35:06.391 --> 00:35:07.759
I will challenge her!

946
00:35:07.759 --> 00:35:08.960
All right.

947
00:35:08.993 --> 00:35:10.762
He's too tall to use the same rope.

948
00:35:10.762 --> 00:35:11.896
- He should use a different rope. - It's over there.

949
00:35:11.896 --> 00:35:13.131
No, you must use the same rope.

950
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:14.365
(Jae Seok firmly insists.)

951
00:35:14.365 --> 00:35:16.134
- There's a longer one. - You must use this one.

952
00:35:16.134 --> 00:35:18.536
- How could I do it with this? - There's one official rope.

953
00:35:18.536 --> 00:35:20.605
I'm over 190cm. How can I jump rope with this?

954
00:35:20.671 --> 00:35:22.240
You're not making any sense.

955
00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.975
You should've listened to me before challenging her.

956
00:35:23.975 --> 00:35:25.410
- Sorry? - You must use the same rope.

957
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.612
- She pushed me! - Wait.

958
00:35:27.612 --> 00:35:29.814
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

959
00:35:29.814 --> 00:35:31.182
You must use the same rope.

960
00:35:31.182 --> 00:35:33.284
(In the end, he's going to try with the same jump rope.)

961
00:35:33.284 --> 00:35:35.453
The rope doesn't even reach the ground. How can I do this?

962
00:35:35.453 --> 00:35:37.688
(Look at this!)

963
00:35:37.688 --> 00:35:38.890
- Work that out on your own. - It must be longer than 2m.

964
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.324
- What? - Look at that. It hits the ground.

965
00:35:40.658 --> 00:35:42.827
(This is how it's supposed to be, right?)

966
00:35:42.827 --> 00:35:43.995
You may declare your challenge.

967
00:35:43.995 --> 00:35:45.396
You're not going to cheer for him, are you?

968
00:35:45.396 --> 00:35:47.064
Let's do this! Kwang Soo, you can do this. Show them what you got!

969
00:35:50.368 --> 00:35:52.303
You didn't mean any of that.

970
00:35:52.303 --> 00:35:55.072
(You didn't mean any of that.)

971
00:35:55.072 --> 00:35:57.108
- Let it go. She's a hassle for me. - Really?

972
00:35:57.842 --> 00:35:59.010
(They have a love-hate relationship.)

973
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.344
- Show them your skill! - She annoys him.

974
00:36:01.446 --> 00:36:03.981
Go for it, Kwang Soo! Show them!

975
00:36:04.715 --> 00:36:06.918
(She kneels down to sincerely cheer for him.)

976
00:36:07.485 --> 00:36:08.953
- What will he show? - Why are you kneeling down?

977
00:36:08.953 --> 00:36:10.121
Why would you kneel down?

978
00:36:10.121 --> 00:36:11.589
- I don't understand you. - What are you doing?

979
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:12.824
Okay! I'll show you what I've got!

980
00:36:12.824 --> 00:36:14.258
(Kwang Soo kneels down too.)

981
00:36:14.258 --> 00:36:16.594
- Show us! - How can they kneel so easily?

982
00:36:16.594 --> 00:36:17.895
I'll jump for you!

983
00:36:17.895 --> 00:36:19.530
(This is for you, So Min!)

984
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.732
- Is he her love interest? - No, no.

985
00:36:21.732 --> 00:36:23.734
- He's not, right? - Let me clarify.

986
00:36:23.734 --> 00:36:25.303
- He's not her love interest. - I'm getting tired of this.

987
00:36:25.303 --> 00:36:26.671
They're just acting silly.

988
00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:27.939
(Jae Seok defines the line.)

989
00:36:27.939 --> 00:36:29.207
- She's just my friend. - They're just playing.

990
00:36:29.207 --> 00:36:30.775
They have zero interest in each other.

991
00:36:30.808 --> 00:36:32.109
All right.

992
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:34.078
- You're going to start now. - I need to continue, right?

993
00:36:34.078 --> 00:36:35.413
Kwang Soo, look ahead of you.

994
00:36:35.413 --> 00:36:36.914
Don't look at the rope. Gaze afar.

995
00:36:36.914 --> 00:36:38.716
- Get ready. Start. - Go.

996
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.118
- Gaze afar. Don't look at the rope. - Se Mi did 26.

997
00:36:41.118 --> 00:36:42.386
Get into rhythm. That's it.

998
00:36:42.386 --> 00:36:43.855
(The rope is short for him. Can he pull this off?)

999
00:36:43.988 --> 00:36:46.991
No, no, no. Don't do it yet. It's not time.

1000
00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:49.393
(He starts to jump rope in order to warm up.)

1001
00:36:49.393 --> 00:36:53.397
(However, he's slapped by the rope.)

1002
00:36:53.397 --> 00:36:55.199
- Kwang Soo, are you okay? - My gosh.

1003
00:36:55.199 --> 00:36:57.435
(When he tried to do a double under, the rope hit his neck.)

1004
00:36:57.435 --> 00:36:58.903
I told you it wasn't time yet!

1005
00:36:59.103 --> 00:37:01.138
- I told you not to try yet. - Are you okay?

1006
00:37:01.138 --> 00:37:02.340
(Kwang Soo is completely humiliated.)

1007
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.942
- I told you it wasn't time yet. - Poor Kwang Soo.

1008
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:07.845
- The rope was too short. - Hold it in.

1009
00:37:07.845 --> 00:37:09.647
How could the rope slap your neck out of all the places?

1010
00:37:09.814 --> 00:37:11.449
The jump rope was too short for me!

1011
00:37:11.549 --> 00:37:13.784
- It was too short for Kwang Soo. - Besides,

1012
00:37:13.985 --> 00:37:16.220
it's not easy to do a double under.

1013
00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.289
- Haha will challenge next. - Great.

1014
00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:20.291
- You do it. That was sudden. - Come on. Just go, and do it.

1015
00:37:20.291 --> 00:37:21.325
- I can't... - Man up, and do it.

1016
00:37:21.325 --> 00:37:23.160
- I can't even do a single one. - Go try it.

1017
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.662
Haha, you don't need to adjust the length.

1018
00:37:24.662 --> 00:37:26.197
(You and Kwang Soo are different.)

1019
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:29.200
You got it. Nice.

1020
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.434
The length is perfect for Haha.

1021
00:37:30.701 --> 00:37:31.869
The length...

1022
00:37:31.869 --> 00:37:33.971
- How can it be so perfect? - It's perfect.

1023
00:37:33.971 --> 00:37:35.239
The length is perfect for you.

1024
00:37:35.239 --> 00:37:37.475
(Do you want to see me walk while I do jump ropes?)

1025
00:37:37.475 --> 00:37:38.609
That's it.

1026
00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.378
- Isn't it too long for you? - It's great.

1027
00:37:40.444 --> 00:37:42.780
- It might be too long for you. - Let me adjust it for you.

1028
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.448
- It seems long for you. - This is hilarious.

1029
00:37:44.448 --> 00:37:45.750
Grab the rope tighter.

1030
00:37:46.284 --> 00:37:48.352
(Look. It's not long.)

1031
00:37:48.386 --> 00:37:49.754
Haha, you can do this, right?

1032
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:53.591
(Haha is done warming up and tries the challenge.)

1033
00:37:53.591 --> 00:37:54.725
All right. I'm going to start now.

1034
00:37:54.725 --> 00:37:56.160
(I'm not ready yet.)

1035
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.762
- He's going to try now. - Here I go.

1036
00:37:57.762 --> 00:38:01.265
(This time, he's really going to try.)

1037
00:38:01.265 --> 00:38:02.466
Here I go.

1038
00:38:02.567 --> 00:38:05.102
- No, no. Not yet. - Haha, do it now.

1039
00:38:06.137 --> 00:38:08.272
- I'm going to do it now. - You're out of energy now.

1040
00:38:08.673 --> 00:38:10.274
No, Haha. You're not ready yet.

1041
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:12.143
- It's not time yet. - He's losing all of his energy.

1042
00:38:12.143 --> 00:38:13.344
Now! Do it now!

1043
00:38:13.344 --> 00:38:14.612
- Haha, do it now. It's time! - It's time!

1044
00:38:14.612 --> 00:38:15.680
(The rope gets stuck,)

1045
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.181
- Now! Do it now! - Haha, do it now.

1046
00:38:17.181 --> 00:38:19.283
(Are they trying to fail on purpose?)

1047
00:38:19.283 --> 00:38:20.451
Are you an idiot?

1048
00:38:20.451 --> 00:38:21.719
Are you a fool?

1049
00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:23.921
Haha, you lost all of your energy.

1050
00:38:23.988 --> 00:38:25.590
I've never tried this in my life.

1051
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.625
If no one is going to challenge, we'll move on now.

1052
00:38:29.427 --> 00:38:30.928
- Let me try. - Okay!

1053
00:38:30.928 --> 00:38:33.764
(It seems doable. Let me try.)

1054
00:38:33.965 --> 00:38:35.199
- Sung Hee. - Sung Hee.

1055
00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:36.200
(Let me put my hair up first.)

1056
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.568
She's going to tie her hair.

1057
00:38:38.803 --> 00:38:40.371
Isn't that interesting?

1058
00:38:40.371 --> 00:38:42.373
She could have tied her hair first and gone out. Right?

1059
00:38:43.274 --> 00:38:44.408
She wants to show us what she's got.

1060
00:38:44.408 --> 00:38:45.743
(It shows how determined she is.)

1061
00:38:45.743 --> 00:38:46.978
Jae Seok, you have good eyes.

1062
00:38:46.978 --> 00:38:49.413
My gosh, that was awesome. You're good.

1063
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.916
- Can I practice? - You get one practice.

1064
00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:53.584
We'll let you practice just once.

1065
00:38:53.718 --> 00:38:54.952
I think she'll be good.

1066
00:38:56.354 --> 00:38:57.955
- I think she'll be good. - She is.

1067
00:38:57.955 --> 00:38:59.056
She can jump lightly.

1068
00:38:59.056 --> 00:39:03.394
(After doing a few jumps, she does double unders.)

1069
00:39:03.394 --> 00:39:05.663
(Sung Hee shows them the perfect double unders.)

1070
00:39:05.663 --> 00:39:07.531
But 26 are too many for me to do.

1071
00:39:07.531 --> 00:39:08.833
I'm betting my money on her.

1072
00:39:09.467 --> 00:39:11.235
I'll bet my whole savings on her!

1073
00:39:11.402 --> 00:39:13.204
- Sung Hee. - We might have to try it again.

1074
00:39:13.704 --> 00:39:15.940
What are you doing? I was giving her a high-five.

1075
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.008
- She's good. - Nice.

1076
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:18.409
Her jumps are light.

1077
00:39:18.409 --> 00:39:19.744
(Let me tie my hair one more time before I begin.)

1078
00:39:19.744 --> 00:39:21.245
All right. Tie you hair.

1079
00:39:21.245 --> 00:39:22.647
- She's putting up her hair. - She's tying her hair.

1080
00:39:23.581 --> 00:39:25.216
- Se Mi, we might have to try again. - Me? Okay.

1081
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:27.718
- Se Mi, get some rest. - Okay.

1082
00:39:27.718 --> 00:39:29.220
- We cannot lose. - Okay.

1083
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.354
She's so good.

1084
00:39:30.755 --> 00:39:32.123
I'll give it a go.

1085
00:39:32.523 --> 00:39:34.358
- Challenge. - Challenge.

1086
00:39:36.394 --> 00:39:41.632
(She can do jump ropes, but can she do double unders too?)

1087
00:39:42.533 --> 00:39:43.668
Two...

1088
00:39:43.668 --> 00:39:44.735
(Swishing)

1089
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:50.741
(She can do double unders. Now, it boils down to the number of jumps.)

1090
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:51.942
- 2, 3... - She's good.

1091
00:39:52.143 --> 00:39:53.844
- My gosh. - What a bummer.

1092
00:39:53.844 --> 00:39:55.279
(Oh, no. The rope gets stuck.)

1093
00:39:55.279 --> 00:39:58.015
- What a bummer. - How unfortunate.

1094
00:39:58.015 --> 00:39:59.150
- What a bummer. - I lost.

1095
00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.685
All right. Therefore,

1096
00:40:00.685 --> 00:40:03.220
Se Mi and I will get a sticker.

1097
00:40:03.487 --> 00:40:05.156
- Se Mi, put it in the middle. - Yes!

1098
00:40:05.623 --> 00:40:07.525
- She has my respect on this. - Yes!

1099
00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:09.660
- Shall I pick next? - Yes. Let's hurry.

1100
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.761
- Yes. - Okay.

1101
00:40:10.761 --> 00:40:12.163
We did a lot of this back in the days.

1102
00:40:12.163 --> 00:40:14.131
- Oh, my. - Jae Seok.

1103
00:40:15.066 --> 00:40:17.201
(No way! He can do double unders like a master.)

1104
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:18.235
How many did you do?

1105
00:40:18.602 --> 00:40:20.371
- How many are you up to? - He's so good.

1106
00:40:20.371 --> 00:40:23.374
(His skill is incomparable to the others so far.)

1107
00:40:23.374 --> 00:40:25.242
How many did you do so far? How many?

1108
00:40:25.242 --> 00:40:29.080
(I've been too modest, haven't I?)

1109
00:40:29.613 --> 00:40:32.016
- He even looks like a master. - He did 39.

1110
00:40:32.016 --> 00:40:33.551
(Swishing)

1111
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:35.553
(Wait, no. That's not what happened.)

1112
00:40:35.553 --> 00:40:37.188
He should be on the national team for rope jumping.

1113
00:40:37.188 --> 00:40:39.990
(He was pretending to do double unders with broken ropes.)

1114
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:41.625
I almost fell for it. Good job.

1115
00:40:42.093 --> 00:40:45.730
I just didn't want you to feel intimated. That's all.

1116
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:46.831
- You're amazing. - Thanks.

1117
00:40:46.831 --> 00:40:48.566
You're very considerate, aren't you?

1118
00:40:48.933 --> 00:40:50.835
- I'll choose the next one. - Go ahead.

1119
00:40:50.901 --> 00:40:52.069
Did he see it?

1120
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:53.170
(It's time to choose the next talent.)

1121
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.206
- This is 5 Second Talk. - Ji Hyo's 5 Second Talk.

1122
00:40:55.206 --> 00:40:56.207
- It's Ji Hyo's? - What is that?

1123
00:40:56.207 --> 00:40:57.341
She's good at this.

1124
00:40:57.341 --> 00:40:59.143
That's right. She's good at this game.

1125
00:40:59.143 --> 00:41:00.911
(Her best talent is winning in 5 Second Talk.)

1126
00:41:00.911 --> 00:41:03.514
I've never thought that this would be my talent.

1127
00:41:03.514 --> 00:41:07.084
But our staff members are helping you realize the talents...

1128
00:41:07.084 --> 00:41:10.020
that you weren't aware of or might have forgotten about.

1129
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:12.456
When we played this game, Ji Hyo's winning rate was high.

1130
00:41:12.456 --> 00:41:14.992
- That's right. - That's why she chose this.

1131
00:41:14.992 --> 00:41:16.861
You're right. She beat the members of Girls Generation.

1132
00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:23.367
(Give 3 unrelated answers to the question within 5 seconds.)

1133
00:41:23.367 --> 00:41:25.469
(Ji Hyo has been ruling the game with nonsense.)

1134
00:41:25.469 --> 00:41:26.937
For those who are not familiar with the game,

1135
00:41:26.937 --> 00:41:28.606
- Kwang Soo will demonstrate. - Okay.

1136
00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.776
- Give 3 answers within 5 seconds. - 3 answers?

1137
00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:33.310
Start.

1138
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:34.645
Name three books you read recently.

1139
00:41:34.645 --> 00:41:35.980
(Name three books you read recently.)

1140
00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.715
"You and I", "You and Me", and "Us".

1141
00:41:38.582 --> 00:41:39.817
Do these count?

1142
00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:43.420
(She answers the question without any hesitation.)

1143
00:41:43.454 --> 00:41:45.189
- Hold on. Do these count? - Why wouldn't they?

1144
00:41:45.189 --> 00:41:46.824
- I love those books. - Do they count?

1145
00:41:46.824 --> 00:41:48.859
- That book is great. - "You and I". "You and Me". "Us".

1146
00:41:48.926 --> 00:41:50.261
They're really great books.

1147
00:41:50.261 --> 00:41:52.429
- Do they exist? - That book moved me.

1148
00:41:52.963 --> 00:41:55.466
Hey, what's wrong with "You and I", "You and Me", and "Us"?

1149
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.700
But it sounds real.

1150
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.868
"You and I" does exist.

1151
00:41:57.868 --> 00:42:00.337
(This is unbelievable.)

1152
00:42:01.071 --> 00:42:03.741
(After researching, it's confirmed "You and I" does exist.)

1153
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:05.109
There is such a book?

1154
00:42:05.176 --> 00:42:06.577
I didn't know Ji Hyo was...

1155
00:42:06.577 --> 00:42:08.612
- a reader. - You've been reading.

1156
00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:11.148
- It does exist. - "You and Me" exists too.

1157
00:42:11.148 --> 00:42:13.951
(This is even more amazing.)

1158
00:42:13.951 --> 00:42:15.452
(They are existing books.)

1159
00:42:15.452 --> 00:42:16.554
Seriously?

1160
00:42:17.054 --> 00:42:18.622
You didn't have to tell us the real titles,

1161
00:42:18.622 --> 00:42:20.624
but you ended up giving us titles of real books.

1162
00:42:21.425 --> 00:42:24.128
(Ji Hyo has proved her talent in 5 Second Talk.)

1163
00:42:24.195 --> 00:42:25.863
Someone from each team should challenge her.

1164
00:42:25.863 --> 00:42:27.298
Everyone's welcome to challenge her.

1165
00:42:28.098 --> 00:42:29.934
Why don't you start us off, So Min?

1166
00:42:30.334 --> 00:42:32.736
I really wanted to see these two competing against each other.

1167
00:42:33.571 --> 00:42:36.607
- Ji Hyo speaks without thinking. - Right.

1168
00:42:36.674 --> 00:42:39.210
So Min just talks nonsense.

1169
00:42:40.177 --> 00:42:41.545
So Min, let's do this.

1170
00:42:42.346 --> 00:42:43.681
If we win this one, we'll get two stickers.

1171
00:42:43.681 --> 00:42:45.683
(The 1st round is So Min versus Ji Hyo)

1172
00:42:45.783 --> 00:42:48.252
You need to ask a bold question to throw her off.

1173
00:42:48.752 --> 00:42:50.054
But Ji Hyo isn't easily flustered.

1174
00:42:50.054 --> 00:42:51.088
(She's not an easy opponent.)

1175
00:42:51.755 --> 00:42:53.757
(So Min will ask first.)

1176
00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:55.059
Start.

1177
00:42:55.059 --> 00:42:56.393
Name three swear words you know.

1178
00:42:56.927 --> 00:42:58.562
Get lost.

1179
00:42:59.797 --> 00:43:02.433
(Those were some offensive words.)

1180
00:43:02.433 --> 00:43:04.368
- Excuse me. - Get lost!

1181
00:43:04.368 --> 00:43:05.736
(Didn't you hear her?)

1182
00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.239
- How can she curse on camera? - You can censor this later.

1183
00:43:08.239 --> 00:43:09.306
You heard her, right?

1184
00:43:09.306 --> 00:43:11.609
What did I do wrong? She asked for them.

1185
00:43:11.642 --> 00:43:13.143
- You should've gone with easy ones. - I only answered the question.

1186
00:43:13.143 --> 00:43:15.613
- Ji Hyo won't hold back anything. - Don't forget to practice.

1187
00:43:15.613 --> 00:43:17.314
Even so, those were too offensive.

1188
00:43:18.115 --> 00:43:20.551
- She just answered the question. - She was playing the game too.

1189
00:43:20.551 --> 00:43:21.652
Good job, Ji Hyo.

1190
00:43:22.219 --> 00:43:24.521
- She named three swear words. - Why did you ask about them then?

1191
00:43:24.521 --> 00:43:26.323
So Min, think of this as practice.

1192
00:43:26.323 --> 00:43:27.992
Ji Hyo, you're up.

1193
00:43:27.992 --> 00:43:29.560
- Get ready. - Speak loudly, please.

1194
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.761
So Min, pull through.

1195
00:43:30.761 --> 00:43:31.962
Start.

1196
00:43:32.763 --> 00:43:35.833
Name three swear words that describe your feelings now.

1197
00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:38.202
(Hold on.)

1198
00:43:38.402 --> 00:43:41.572
(We strive to comply with broadcasting regulations.)

1199
00:43:41.572 --> 00:43:44.608
(Shall we take a look at these beautiful giraffes?)

1200
00:43:45.242 --> 00:43:46.644
This game needs to air at least.

1201
00:43:46.644 --> 00:43:49.546
(I understand this is a game, but it still needs to air.)

1202
00:43:49.613 --> 00:43:51.682
We are back to square one. They exchanged swear words.

1203
00:43:51.682 --> 00:43:52.683
(The shoot is about to end.)

1204
00:43:52.683 --> 00:43:53.784
- I... - Yes?

1205
00:43:53.784 --> 00:43:55.419
I realized this again.

1206
00:43:55.419 --> 00:43:57.521
I don't want to go anywhere with you two.

1207
00:43:57.888 --> 00:44:00.557
- They'll swear so much. - They...

1208
00:44:00.557 --> 00:44:02.860
The unedited version should be aired once.

1209
00:44:03.027 --> 00:44:05.062
They're so good at swearing.

1210
00:44:05.195 --> 00:44:06.964
So Min, please go back.

1211
00:44:07.831 --> 00:44:10.367
Who would want to try now?

1212
00:44:10.367 --> 00:44:12.202
- No one. - Regardless of the result,

1213
00:44:12.202 --> 00:44:13.570
they'd be...

1214
00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:15.839
- Se Jeong will try. - Se Jeong.

1215
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.441
Se Jeong, go.

1216
00:44:17.441 --> 00:44:19.610
Be tough. She's strong.

1217
00:44:20.077 --> 00:44:21.779
- Just say anything. - Just say anything.

1218
00:44:21.779 --> 00:44:23.414
You can say whatever.

1219
00:44:23.447 --> 00:44:26.317
Ready, start.

1220
00:44:26.784 --> 00:44:28.919
Name three idol group members you love.

1221
00:44:28.986 --> 00:44:31.388
Jee Seok Jin, Yahaha, and Yang Dong Geun.

1222
00:44:31.388 --> 00:44:34.224
(Jee Seok Jin, Yahaha, and Yang Dong Geun)

1223
00:44:34.224 --> 00:44:35.559
(Who is Yahaha?)

1224
00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:36.994
- Yahaha? - Wait.

1225
00:44:36.994 --> 00:44:39.630
She means Haha.

1226
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:41.565
- Hold on. - That sounded odd.

1227
00:44:41.799 --> 00:44:43.634
- That was weird. - Hold on.

1228
00:44:43.634 --> 00:44:44.802
Haha.

1229
00:44:44.802 --> 00:44:47.071
- It was Haha. - Haha.

1230
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:48.472
I'll give her...

1231
00:44:48.472 --> 00:44:50.341
- another chance. - Okay.

1232
00:44:50.341 --> 00:44:51.842
- Good job. - It's...

1233
00:44:51.842 --> 00:44:54.645
As you can see, the 5 Second Talk master,

1234
00:44:54.678 --> 00:44:57.281
- Ji Hyo, doesn't seem to be... - She's so calm.

1235
00:44:57.281 --> 00:45:00.250
She doesn't care...

1236
00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.785
who wins.

1237
00:45:01.785 --> 00:45:03.954
Her mind is blank. That's the attitude you need.

1238
00:45:03.954 --> 00:45:05.756
- She's so good. - Ready.

1239
00:45:06.256 --> 00:45:08.158
Start.

1240
00:45:08.158 --> 00:45:10.961
Name three celebrities you went out with.

1241
00:45:11.195 --> 00:45:13.397
Yu Jae Seok, Kang Dong Geun...

1242
00:45:13.397 --> 00:45:15.432
(Kang Dong Geun?)

1243
00:45:15.466 --> 00:45:17.067
Who's that?

1244
00:45:17.801 --> 00:45:20.371
(Is it Kang Dong Won and Yang Dong Geun?)

1245
00:45:20.371 --> 00:45:22.139
This is a fatal question to all idol members.

1246
00:45:22.139 --> 00:45:23.741
- You're... - You love Yang Dong Geun.

1247
00:45:23.741 --> 00:45:25.943
- You seem to love Yang Dong Geun. - Kang Dong Geun.

1248
00:45:26.043 --> 00:45:27.945
You were spot on.

1249
00:45:28.278 --> 00:45:30.914
If anyone beats her, she will win two stickers.

1250
00:45:30.914 --> 00:45:32.883
- Se Jeong failed. - Do you want to try?

1251
00:45:32.883 --> 00:45:35.219
- Sung Hee, do you want to try? - Go get them.

1252
00:45:35.219 --> 00:45:38.489
Bring me money. Make some money!

1253
00:45:38.489 --> 00:45:39.590
Hold on.

1254
00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:41.592
- Can you not cheer for her? - What?

1255
00:45:41.892 --> 00:45:43.427
You can do it.

1256
00:45:43.494 --> 00:45:45.095
- Well... - Bring me money.

1257
00:45:45.095 --> 00:45:47.431
It's too inappropriate.

1258
00:45:48.232 --> 00:45:49.867
Sung Hee is losing her morale.

1259
00:45:49.867 --> 00:45:51.135
(Seok Jin's cheering makes her lose her morale.)

1260
00:45:51.135 --> 00:45:52.202
Ready.

1261
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:54.338
You have to succeed.

1262
00:45:54.338 --> 00:45:55.773
Don't think too much.

1263
00:45:56.673 --> 00:45:59.343
It's okay to help out.

1264
00:45:59.343 --> 00:46:01.011
Why aren't you helping me?

1265
00:46:01.011 --> 00:46:03.013
(Seok Jin, why aren't you helping me?)

1266
00:46:03.013 --> 00:46:05.049
- Deal with it on your own. - I'm struggling.

1267
00:46:05.582 --> 00:46:08.452
- Seok Jin... - It's your life.

1268
00:46:08.452 --> 00:46:10.654
Seok Jin never helps out.

1269
00:46:10.754 --> 00:46:12.122
He just says, "You're doing great."

1270
00:46:12.122 --> 00:46:14.091
(He just throws in a few words.)

1271
00:46:14.091 --> 00:46:15.659
You have to take care of it on your own.

1272
00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:18.362
Be strong. Life is hard.

1273
00:46:18.562 --> 00:46:21.698
- Look at her face. You're amazing. - Ready, start.

1274
00:46:21.698 --> 00:46:22.866
(Sung Hee attacks.)

1275
00:46:22.866 --> 00:46:25.235
Name three actors you wanted to kill.

1276
00:46:25.803 --> 00:46:28.772
Kim Jong Kook, Yu Jae Seok, and Lee Kwang Soo.

1277
00:46:30.007 --> 00:46:33.844
(Ji Hyo wanted to kill Jong Kook, Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo.)

1278
00:46:33.844 --> 00:46:36.246
- Hold on. - She's consistent.

1279
00:46:36.246 --> 00:46:37.481
- She should name actors. - No.

1280
00:46:37.481 --> 00:46:39.116
She should only say...

1281
00:46:39.116 --> 00:46:41.385
- actors' names. - No.

1282
00:46:41.385 --> 00:46:44.488
Producer Kim, stop pretending.

1283
00:46:45.155 --> 00:46:47.691
- You appeared in "The Producers". - Jong Kook likes it.

1284
00:46:48.592 --> 00:46:50.294
- I did. - He likes it.

1285
00:46:51.562 --> 00:46:55.199
(He shot a kissing scene with Ye Ji Won.)

1286
00:46:55.332 --> 00:46:58.168
- I guess I was an actor. - I didn't know.

1287
00:46:58.168 --> 00:47:00.471
You're doing great. It's neck and neck.

1288
00:47:00.904 --> 00:47:02.272
Start.

1289
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.742
Name three actors you had feelings for.

1290
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.179
Jung Il Woo, Kim Jae Joong, and Kim Moo Yul.

1291
00:47:09.179 --> 00:47:12.549
(Jung Il Woo, Kim Jae Joong, and Kim Moo Yul)

1292
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:14.818
(She answered without hesitation.)

1293
00:47:15.486 --> 00:47:17.054
She answered.

1294
00:47:17.054 --> 00:47:19.323
She's not affected by questions like that.

1295
00:47:19.323 --> 00:47:22.292
Sung Hee is so good.

1296
00:47:22.593 --> 00:47:24.194
Name three Korean proverbs.

1297
00:47:24.761 --> 00:47:26.029
(Ji Hyo is weak.)

1298
00:47:26.029 --> 00:47:27.464
- Ji Hyo loses. - We win.

1299
00:47:27.531 --> 00:47:29.333
- I admit it. - We win!

1300
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.601
Yes!

1301
00:47:30.601 --> 00:47:31.668
(Sung Hee beats Ji Hyo.)

1302
00:47:31.668 --> 00:47:33.504
- She's so strong. - Start.

1303
00:47:33.737 --> 00:47:35.739
Name three smelly body parts of yours.

1304
00:47:35.806 --> 00:47:37.074
Eyes, nose, and mouth.

1305
00:47:37.074 --> 00:47:38.075
She's so good.

1306
00:47:38.075 --> 00:47:39.343
(Eyes, nose, and mouth)

1307
00:47:39.343 --> 00:47:41.078
(That's so fresh.)

1308
00:47:41.078 --> 00:47:44.148
Questions like that can't affect Sung Hee anymore.

1309
00:47:44.181 --> 00:47:46.116
Name three math formulas.

1310
00:47:46.116 --> 00:47:47.284
3 days and 2 nights.

1311
00:47:47.484 --> 00:47:48.819
(Sung Hee is eliminated.)

1312
00:47:48.819 --> 00:47:50.654
Math formulas got her.

1313
00:47:50.754 --> 00:47:53.056
Se Mi, we win.

1314
00:47:53.056 --> 00:47:55.325
(Se Min wins 2 stickers.)

1315
00:47:55.325 --> 00:47:56.560
Bingo!

1316
00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.895
(Jae Seok and Se Mi win.)

1317
00:47:57.895 --> 00:48:00.197
- Se Mi, you're amazing. - No, I'm not.

1318
00:48:01.598 --> 00:48:04.201
We're the winners.

1319
00:48:04.201 --> 00:48:05.936
You can't beat us.

1320
00:48:05.936 --> 00:48:07.471
Don't even dream of it.

1321
00:48:07.471 --> 00:48:09.273
Let's see who finishes second.

1322
00:48:09.673 --> 00:48:11.375
We're so lucky.

1323
00:48:11.542 --> 00:48:12.676
We can't do anything about it, can we?

1324
00:48:13.944 --> 00:48:15.812
I hate him.

1325
00:48:15.946 --> 00:48:17.281
All right.

1326
00:48:18.115 --> 00:48:19.383
(The 2nd talent is...)

1327
00:48:19.383 --> 00:48:20.984
- Superpowers. - Superpowers.

1328
00:48:21.051 --> 00:48:23.020
- It's mine. - Ji Min.

1329
00:48:23.253 --> 00:48:26.290
(Superpowers)

1330
00:48:26.423 --> 00:48:28.192
- What do you mean by it? - What is it?

1331
00:48:28.525 --> 00:48:29.660
Is it super strength?

1332
00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:33.397
You can't achieve it by working hard.

1333
00:48:33.664 --> 00:48:35.232
You have to be born with it.

1334
00:48:35.732 --> 00:48:38.001
Let me put my tongue...

1335
00:48:38.202 --> 00:48:40.537
in my nostril.

1336
00:48:40.537 --> 00:48:42.673
(Let me put my tongue in my nostril.)

1337
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.342
In your nostril? Not the tip of your nose?

1338
00:48:46.243 --> 00:48:50.180
I've seen people touch the tip of their nose with their tongue.

1339
00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.949
But you're putting your tongue inside your nostril?

1340
00:48:51.949 --> 00:48:53.317
- I'll start. - Ready.

1341
00:48:53.584 --> 00:48:56.153
I don't want to see any stills of it.

1342
00:48:56.253 --> 00:48:57.754
1, 2, 3.

1343
00:48:58.021 --> 00:48:59.890
(Her tongue...)

1344
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.259
(went into her nostril.)

1345
00:49:04.094 --> 00:49:05.429
(It's in.)

1346
00:49:05.429 --> 00:49:06.730
That's amazing.

1347
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:08.932
It went into her nostril.

1348
00:49:09.233 --> 00:49:11.235
It was in.

1349
00:49:12.135 --> 00:49:14.638
(By the way,)

1350
00:49:14.638 --> 00:49:16.873
(It's a good thing that she succeeded, but...)

1351
00:49:16.873 --> 00:49:19.209
It's incredible.

1352
00:49:19.209 --> 00:49:20.877
(Why is it so sad?)

1353
00:49:20.944 --> 00:49:22.479
(Race of Heirs was supposed to be...)

1354
00:49:22.479 --> 00:49:24.548
(elegant and fancy.)

1355
00:49:24.548 --> 00:49:27.718
(Goodbye, elegance.)

1356
00:49:28.485 --> 00:49:29.686
(Ji Min sacrificed herself.)

1357
00:49:29.686 --> 00:49:31.822
- It went in, right? - It did.

1358
00:49:31.822 --> 00:49:32.990
It happened very fast.

1359
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:34.825
It's a hard task for female celebrities.

1360
00:49:34.825 --> 00:49:36.193
They wouldn't even admit to it.

1361
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:40.430
(They don't mind trying.)

1362
00:49:41.865 --> 00:49:44.301
(What?)

1363
00:49:44.301 --> 00:49:46.570
(Do you really want to do this?)

1364
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:49.840
(The pride of Dongduk Women's University)

1365
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.174
She can do it.

1366
00:49:54.144 --> 00:49:56.280
I mean it.

1367
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.848
- Stop it. - Seriously.

1368
00:49:57.848 --> 00:49:59.216
- Stop it. - Trust me.

1369
00:49:59.283 --> 00:50:00.884
He can do it.

1370
00:50:00.884 --> 00:50:02.853
(They help each other.)

1371
00:50:03.253 --> 00:50:04.421
What are they doing?

1372
00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:05.489
(What are those two doing?)

1373
00:50:05.489 --> 00:50:06.657
What are you doing?

1374
00:50:07.424 --> 00:50:08.792
Do you call this romance?

1375
00:50:09.026 --> 00:50:11.995
- It's disgusting. - They held each other's tongues.

1376
00:50:11.995 --> 00:50:13.664
- We're a team. - Seriously.

1377
00:50:13.664 --> 00:50:14.898
We help each other out.

1378
00:50:14.898 --> 00:50:16.733
Don't team up again.

1379
00:50:16.967 --> 00:50:18.235
Gosh.

1380
00:50:18.902 --> 00:50:21.038
Even if you can't do this one,

1381
00:50:21.038 --> 00:50:23.573
is there anything else you can show off?

1382
00:50:23.573 --> 00:50:26.576
I can move only one eye.

1383
00:50:26.576 --> 00:50:27.744
Show us.

1384
00:50:28.078 --> 00:50:29.780
This eye will stay still, and this eye will move.

1385
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.415
Hey.

1386
00:50:31.415 --> 00:50:32.816
Both eyes are moving.

1387
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.319
(Fail)

1388
00:50:35.352 --> 00:50:36.453
(You shouldn't do this.)

1389
00:50:36.453 --> 00:50:39.122
You do this all the time.

1390
00:50:39.489 --> 00:50:40.557
(So Min is trying something.)

1391
00:50:40.557 --> 00:50:41.725
What's with your mouth?

1392
00:50:41.725 --> 00:50:43.493
- You failed. - I can...

1393
00:50:43.493 --> 00:50:45.128
- It doesn't count. - I can move my ears.

1394
00:50:45.128 --> 00:50:46.530
She can move her ears.

1395
00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:48.332
No one has beaten Ji Min yet.

1396
00:50:48.365 --> 00:50:49.566
Start.

1397
00:50:49.933 --> 00:50:51.802
(Her forehead moves too.)

1398
00:50:51.802 --> 00:50:53.270
Your face moved too.

1399
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.272
- I can do it without moving... - You failed.

1400
00:50:55.372 --> 00:50:56.540
All right.

1401
00:50:58.842 --> 00:51:01.678
(I didn't want to do this.)

1402
00:51:01.678 --> 00:51:02.913
Finally!

1403
00:51:02.913 --> 00:51:08.318
(Kwang Soo can bend his thumb to the back of his hand.)

1404
00:51:09.486 --> 00:51:10.754
It counts.

1405
00:51:11.254 --> 00:51:13.090
- That's scary. - I can do it too.

1406
00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:15.292
- I can do it too. - Everyone can do it.

1407
00:51:15.425 --> 00:51:16.893
Everyone can do it.

1408
00:51:16.893 --> 00:51:18.328
(Others can do it too.)

1409
00:51:18.328 --> 00:51:20.931
- Everyone can do it. - It's different.

1410
00:51:20.964 --> 00:51:22.899
- That doesn't count. - You failed.

1411
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.370
It's just that I have never seen it. It's nothing special.

1412
00:51:27.237 --> 00:51:29.473
Go back.

1413
00:51:29.473 --> 00:51:32.275
I'm the winner.

1414
00:51:32.275 --> 00:51:33.643
Sung Hee, can you show us something?

1415
00:51:33.744 --> 00:51:35.879
What about you, Se Jeong? Something trivial is okay too.

1416
00:51:35.879 --> 00:51:39.082
My finger is missing.

1417
00:51:39.082 --> 00:51:40.450
- What? - It's here.

1418
00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:41.985
(It's here.)

1419
00:51:42.219 --> 00:51:43.353
What's that?

1420
00:51:43.553 --> 00:51:44.755
What are you doing?

1421
00:51:45.522 --> 00:51:46.823
He's so cute.

1422
00:51:46.823 --> 00:51:47.824
(My kids were amazed by it.)

1423
00:51:47.824 --> 00:51:49.593
- I have 1 more. - She has 1 more.

1424
00:51:49.593 --> 00:51:50.894
- 1 more. - 1 more.

1425
00:51:50.894 --> 00:51:52.129
There might be someone who can do it.

1426
00:51:52.129 --> 00:51:54.931
If no one can do it, Ji Min will finish second.

1427
00:51:54.931 --> 00:51:56.967
I'll be able to do this until I die.

1428
00:51:57.634 --> 00:52:00.604
(What is Ji Min's second feat?)

1429
00:52:02.639 --> 00:52:06.042
(She can put her leg behind her neck.)

1430
00:52:06.143 --> 00:52:07.644
That looks hard.

1431
00:52:07.644 --> 00:52:09.012
Girls might be able to do it.

1432
00:52:09.012 --> 00:52:10.180
(It doesn't look as hard as the first one.)

1433
00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.314
Try it.

1434
00:52:11.848 --> 00:52:13.850
- She can do it. - She can do it.

1435
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:15.285
Sung Hee can do it.

1436
00:52:15.285 --> 00:52:17.120
- Sung Hee can do it. - Please come here.

1437
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.388
Sung Hee...

1438
00:52:18.388 --> 00:52:20.123
She can do everything.

1439
00:52:20.123 --> 00:52:22.526
Scratch your back with your foot.

1440
00:52:23.427 --> 00:52:24.895
(Meanwhile...)

1441
00:52:24.895 --> 00:52:27.063
- I can't do it. - Just try it.

1442
00:52:27.464 --> 00:52:29.366
- Try it. - I can't.

1443
00:52:29.366 --> 00:52:31.802
(You can do it.)

1444
00:52:32.469 --> 00:52:35.071
(Kwang Soo encourages So Min.)

1445
00:52:35.071 --> 00:52:37.541
I can't do it!

1446
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:39.109
Stop it.

1447
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:40.510
Is this romance?

1448
00:52:41.711 --> 00:52:42.946
So Min can do it.

1449
00:52:43.346 --> 00:52:44.414
Stop it.

1450
00:52:44.414 --> 00:52:46.049
- She can do it. - Sung Hee.

1451
00:52:46.049 --> 00:52:47.451
- Just put my leg behind my neck? - Sung Hee.

1452
00:52:47.451 --> 00:52:48.652
You're almost there.

1453
00:52:49.052 --> 00:52:50.954
(So Min fails.)

1454
00:52:50.954 --> 00:52:52.022
Sung Hee.

1455
00:52:52.989 --> 00:52:54.391
She can do it.

1456
00:52:55.759 --> 00:52:56.960
(She succeeds easily.)

1457
00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.628
Sung Hee should win.

1458
00:52:59.029 --> 00:53:00.997
She's even more flexible.

1459
00:53:00.997 --> 00:53:03.900
Put your tongue in your nostril with your leg behind your neck.

1460
00:53:05.869 --> 00:53:07.504
- Right. - Can you do it?

1461
00:53:07.504 --> 00:53:09.372
- Show us. - Show us.

1462
00:53:09.372 --> 00:53:10.640
- You have to do it. - You can do it.

1463
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.276
If you succeed, you'll win.

1464
00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:15.378
You can do it.

1465
00:53:15.512 --> 00:53:17.447
You have to do it.

1466
00:53:17.514 --> 00:53:19.216
Ready.

1467
00:53:19.216 --> 00:53:20.684
(Her leg is behind her neck.)

1468
00:53:20.684 --> 00:53:24.154
(She just needs to put her tongue in her nostril.)

1469
00:53:24.454 --> 00:53:26.389
Is that a superpower?

1470
00:53:26.389 --> 00:53:27.491
(Do we have to go this far?)

1471
00:53:29.392 --> 00:53:32.262
(It's in.)

1472
00:53:32.762 --> 00:53:36.600
(Ji Min proves her superpower.)

1473
00:53:38.034 --> 00:53:41.037
Jong Kook and Ji Min win second place.

1474
00:53:41.838 --> 00:53:43.073
Ji Min.

1475
00:53:43.406 --> 00:53:45.342
Good job.

1476
00:53:45.909 --> 00:53:48.645
Jae Seok and Se Mi can find out...

1477
00:53:48.645 --> 00:53:51.581
the rank of a chosen member and a hint about the daughter.

1478
00:53:51.581 --> 00:53:52.616
Really?

1479
00:53:52.616 --> 00:53:54.484
- The rank of a chosen member? - The rank of a chosen member.

1480
00:53:54.484 --> 00:53:57.387
- Say which rank you want to know. - Which rank?

1481
00:53:57.387 --> 00:53:59.956
Shouldn't we know about the one we'll eliminate?

1482
00:53:59.956 --> 00:54:02.058
- Which rank? - We have to eliminate.

1483
00:54:02.592 --> 00:54:04.127
Which rank?

1484
00:54:04.127 --> 00:54:05.195
- 3rd. - 3rd.

1485
00:54:05.762 --> 00:54:07.998
The couple that's third in rank...

1486
00:54:07.998 --> 00:54:10.867
is Jong Kook and Ji Min.

1487
00:54:10.867 --> 00:54:12.669
(It's Jong Kook and Ji Min.)

1488
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.172
- Look how long her tongue is. - Goodness.

1489
00:54:16.306 --> 00:54:17.874
It touches the nose.

1490
00:54:17.874 --> 00:54:19.309
We're so unlucky.

1491
00:54:20.744 --> 00:54:23.747
(How will they eliminate him?)

1492
00:54:24.681 --> 00:54:27.717
Take a look at the hint about the youngest daughter.

1493
00:54:27.717 --> 00:54:28.685
(It's given to 1st and 2nd places.)

1494
00:54:28.685 --> 00:54:30.320
- Why do we... - Don't look.

1495
00:54:31.555 --> 00:54:34.591
Take a look at the hint about the youngest daughter.

1496
00:54:34.591 --> 00:54:35.559
(It's given to 1st and 2nd places.)

1497
00:54:35.559 --> 00:54:37.193
- Why do we... - Don't look.

1498
00:54:37.294 --> 00:54:39.863
(There is an S in the youngest daughter's name.)

1499
00:54:41.898 --> 00:54:43.667
It's too general.

1500
00:54:43.667 --> 00:54:45.869
It's always general.

1501
00:54:45.902 --> 00:54:48.638
We can narrow down the possibilities.

1502
00:54:48.772 --> 00:54:49.873
There's only one.

1503
00:54:49.873 --> 00:54:52.976
(Ji Min isn't the youngest daughter.)

1504
00:54:53.209 --> 00:54:55.412
Let's move onto the next round.

1505
00:54:55.579 --> 00:54:58.014
- Let's go now. - Where are we going?

1506
00:54:58.014 --> 00:54:59.449
(They move to the next round.)

1507
00:55:00.317 --> 00:55:01.818
(Transfer Area Park in Incheon International Airport)

1508
00:55:01.818 --> 00:55:06.456
Next mission tests the couples' acting and improvisation skills.

1509
00:55:06.456 --> 00:55:09.025
It's called It Hurts Me Too.

1510
00:55:09.025 --> 00:55:10.894
(It Hurts Me Too)

1511
00:55:10.894 --> 00:55:12.095
It Hurts Me Too.

1512
00:55:12.095 --> 00:55:14.264
Couples play one at a time.

1513
00:55:14.264 --> 00:55:15.899
The couple reenacts a scene...

1514
00:55:15.899 --> 00:55:19.202
that's chosen randomly by the female partner.

1515
00:55:19.402 --> 00:55:21.104
Based on the judges' scores,

1516
00:55:21.104 --> 00:55:23.406
you'll gain extra time on the final mission.

1517
00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:27.243
Within the 30-second time limit plus additional time you gain,

1518
00:55:27.243 --> 00:55:29.613
if the female pops all the balloons...

1519
00:55:29.613 --> 00:55:32.349
attached on her partner's apron, the mission is cleared.

1520
00:55:32.482 --> 00:55:36.052
The couple that finishes within the least amount of time...

1521
00:55:36.052 --> 00:55:37.787
will get the hint.

1522
00:55:38.088 --> 00:55:42.892
The judges are the female members' managers.

1523
00:55:42.959 --> 00:55:44.427
That's great.

1524
00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:46.529
Let's do it in order.

1525
00:55:46.529 --> 00:55:48.865
The first couple is Jong Kook and Ji Min.

1526
00:55:48.865 --> 00:55:50.266
- Yes. - Okay.

1527
00:55:50.734 --> 00:55:51.801
This is difficult.

1528
00:55:51.801 --> 00:55:53.003
(It's a scene from "Temperature of Love".)

1529
00:55:53.003 --> 00:55:54.270
Ready, action.

1530
00:55:56.039 --> 00:56:00.276
(It's a kissing scene that makes your heart flutter.)

1531
00:56:00.276 --> 00:56:03.747
(I'm not sure if I love you or not.)

1532
00:56:04.648 --> 00:56:08.018
(Women don't kiss when you're too honest.)

1533
00:56:08.985 --> 00:56:11.888
(Move away if you don't want it.)

1534
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:19.829
(Will Jong Kook and Ji Min reenact such a romantic scene?)

1535
00:56:22.499 --> 00:56:23.600
I want to kiss you.

1536
00:56:24.567 --> 00:56:25.669
He sounds scary.

1537
00:56:26.369 --> 00:56:27.971
Do I have to be responsible?

1538
00:56:28.204 --> 00:56:30.140
- They should kiss first. - No.

1539
00:56:31.207 --> 00:56:34.878
I won't kiss you if you're too honest.

1540
00:56:34.878 --> 00:56:36.413
Women have fantasies.

1541
00:56:36.413 --> 00:56:37.447
(Laughing)

1542
00:56:38.481 --> 00:56:40.817
Kiss me if you love me.

1543
00:56:40.817 --> 00:56:43.086
(Kiss me if you love me.)

1544
00:56:43.386 --> 00:56:44.587
Move away if you don't want it.

1545
00:56:46.956 --> 00:56:49.659
- They're so cute. - They make my heart flutter.

1546
00:56:49.959 --> 00:56:51.494
Move away if you don't want it.

1547
00:56:55.832 --> 00:56:56.933
Come here.

1548
00:56:56.933 --> 00:56:59.202
(She moves away.)

1549
00:57:02.172 --> 00:57:04.074
She doesn't want it.

1550
00:57:04.074 --> 00:57:06.142
She really doesn't want it.

1551
00:57:06.276 --> 00:57:08.745
She really doesn't want it.

1552
00:57:08.945 --> 00:57:11.948
1, 2, 3. What's the score?

1553
00:57:12.148 --> 00:57:13.416
(Additional time depends on the score.)

1554
00:57:13.416 --> 00:57:16.252
- I bet their score will be high. - Right.

1555
00:57:16.352 --> 00:57:17.754
- This. - Is it?

1556
00:57:18.188 --> 00:57:20.857
She chooses the one from Ji Min's manager.

1557
00:57:20.857 --> 00:57:22.358
- Right. - What's the score?

1558
00:57:22.959 --> 00:57:25.128
- It's negative 10. - Negative?

1559
00:57:25.128 --> 00:57:27.497
He's Ji Min's manager, but he gave negative 10.

1560
00:57:27.497 --> 00:57:28.832
It wasn't bad.

1561
00:57:29.099 --> 00:57:30.200
That's right.

1562
00:57:30.667 --> 00:57:32.769
You're doing well.

1563
00:57:33.002 --> 00:57:34.137
You can do it.

1564
00:57:35.004 --> 00:57:36.639
(Be careful.)

1565
00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:38.041
You can do it.

1566
00:57:38.641 --> 00:57:43.313
(She aims a balloon near a sensitive spot.)

1567
00:57:43.313 --> 00:57:44.681
Hey, Ji Min.

1568
00:57:45.081 --> 00:57:46.983
Ji Min.

1569
00:57:46.983 --> 00:57:48.618
- Goodness. - Are you crazy?

1570
00:57:49.753 --> 00:57:51.554
All right.

1571
00:57:51.554 --> 00:57:53.656
(They fail to clear the mission.)

1572
00:57:54.758 --> 00:57:56.893
Next is Kwang Soo and So Min.

1573
00:57:56.893 --> 00:57:59.129
- I can't wait. - I can't wait to see them.

1574
00:57:59.129 --> 00:58:00.196
(A scene from "The Heirs")

1575
00:58:01.564 --> 00:58:06.069
(Kim Tan confesses his love to Cha Eun Sang in a movie theater.)

1576
00:58:06.169 --> 00:58:11.040
(To trust you, I need to know who you are.)

1577
00:58:11.374 --> 00:58:14.177
(I have a question for you.)

1578
00:58:14.577 --> 00:58:17.714
(Do I...)

1579
00:58:17.714 --> 00:58:19.682
(like you?)

1580
00:58:22.752 --> 00:58:25.455
(He's in deep sleep.)

1581
00:58:26.556 --> 00:58:29.526
(Drooling)

1582
00:58:29.526 --> 00:58:30.527
(Their approach is more realistic.)

1583
00:58:30.527 --> 00:58:31.628
He woke up.

1584
00:58:31.628 --> 00:58:33.062
(Their approach is more realistic.)

1585
00:58:34.864 --> 00:58:35.965
To trust you...

1586
00:58:35.965 --> 00:58:37.534
(He's still sleepy.)

1587
00:58:37.534 --> 00:58:39.002
I need to know who you are.

1588
00:58:39.636 --> 00:58:41.004
Weren't you asleep?

1589
00:58:41.871 --> 00:58:43.873
(What are they doing?)

1590
00:58:44.307 --> 00:58:45.942
I met a girl yesterday.

1591
00:58:45.942 --> 00:58:49.913
(I met a girl yesterday.)

1592
00:58:50.647 --> 00:58:52.081
Her name is Cha Jin Sang.

1593
00:58:53.249 --> 00:58:55.018
(It's Cha Jin Sang, not Cha Eun Sang.)

1594
00:58:55.418 --> 00:58:57.353
I have a question for Jin Sang.

1595
00:58:59.422 --> 00:59:00.523
Do I...

1596
00:59:00.523 --> 00:59:04.093
(Do I...)

1597
00:59:04.093 --> 00:59:05.161
Like...

1598
00:59:06.830 --> 00:59:07.964
you?

1599
00:59:07.964 --> 00:59:09.866
(Do I like you?)

1600
00:59:10.667 --> 00:59:12.101
Do you like me?

1601
00:59:17.207 --> 00:59:18.875
(Her expression of love is R-rated.)

1602
00:59:18.875 --> 00:59:20.243
- What? - What are you doing?

1603
00:59:20.243 --> 00:59:22.579
What are you two doing?

1604
00:59:22.812 --> 00:59:24.314
- What are you doing? - What?

1605
00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.083
They always finish in a strange way.

1606
00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:29.419
- That's not it. - What are you doing?

1607
00:59:29.419 --> 00:59:32.488
All we did was reenact the scene.

1608
00:59:32.488 --> 00:59:35.291
Tell us. Are you trying to act like lovers?

1609
00:59:35.758 --> 00:59:37.126
(Tell us exactly what you're trying to do.)

1610
00:59:37.126 --> 00:59:38.127
That's not it.

1611
00:59:38.127 --> 00:59:40.096
We should know as your colleagues.

1612
00:59:40.296 --> 00:59:41.664
That wasn't our intention.

1613
00:59:42.732 --> 00:59:45.134
(It's time to receive their scores.)

1614
00:59:45.134 --> 00:59:46.436
What is he doing?

1615
00:59:46.436 --> 00:59:47.503
Choose the blue one.

1616
00:59:47.503 --> 00:59:51.608
(They choose a blue airplane from So Min's manager.)

1617
00:59:51.608 --> 00:59:53.543
It's positive three.

1618
00:59:53.543 --> 00:59:55.278
(He gives them a high score.)

1619
00:59:55.278 --> 00:59:56.646
Let me check. Here you go.

1620
00:59:56.646 --> 00:59:58.648
You have 33 seconds. Ready, set, go.

1621
00:59:58.648 --> 01:00:01.084
(She starts to pop the balloons.)

1622
01:00:02.986 --> 01:00:04.754
What is she doing?

1623
01:00:04.754 --> 01:00:06.890
- You should punch. - She can't do it.

1624
01:00:06.923 --> 01:00:08.658
I'm trying.

1625
01:00:09.459 --> 01:00:10.560
Wait.

1626
01:00:11.294 --> 01:00:15.899
- The last two balloons are... - Look.

1627
01:00:15.899 --> 01:00:17.834
(What?)

1628
01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:19.068
The last two balloons.

1629
01:00:20.003 --> 01:00:22.872
Wait, wait. Pop one now.

1630
01:00:23.006 --> 01:00:24.274
Pop one now.

1631
01:00:24.274 --> 01:00:26.042
(How can I pop it?)

1632
01:00:28.044 --> 01:00:29.145
It's sensitive.

1633
01:00:29.145 --> 01:00:31.514
Be careful. It's a sensitive and precious spot.

1634
01:00:31.514 --> 01:00:32.548
Seriously.

1635
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:34.484
Why...

1636
01:00:34.484 --> 01:00:35.485
(She can't punch properly.)

1637
01:00:35.485 --> 01:00:36.486
Why are they there?

1638
01:00:36.486 --> 01:00:38.855
(They fail to clear the mission.)

1639
01:00:38.855 --> 01:00:39.889
All right.

1640
01:00:39.956 --> 01:00:43.526
- By the way... - The balloons are placed...

1641
01:00:43.526 --> 01:00:45.194
Since you joined the show,

1642
01:00:45.728 --> 01:00:47.597
Running Man became strange.

1643
01:00:47.797 --> 01:00:49.198
It became R-rated.

1644
01:00:49.198 --> 01:00:51.034
- No way. - It's true.

1645
01:00:51.034 --> 01:00:52.068
No way.

1646
01:00:53.269 --> 01:00:58.107
With Se Mi, I'll reenact...

1647
01:00:58.107 --> 01:01:00.443
this famous scene.

1648
01:01:00.443 --> 01:01:03.346
I interpreted Won Bin's part differently.

1649
01:01:05.882 --> 01:01:10.286
(The famous line by Won Bin became more popular than the main actor.)

1650
01:01:11.654 --> 01:01:16.025
(How much will it be?)

1651
01:01:16.025 --> 01:01:18.027
(How much would be enough?)

1652
01:01:18.027 --> 01:01:22.131
(How will Jae Seok reinterpret Won Bin's line?)

1653
01:01:22.131 --> 01:01:24.067
Hey, you.

1654
01:01:24.067 --> 01:01:26.402
(He reenacts it in a funny way.)

1655
01:01:26.402 --> 01:01:28.404
- How could you say that? - He startled me.

1656
01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:29.639
That's out of the blue.

1657
01:01:29.706 --> 01:01:31.040
He reinterprets it.

1658
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.508
Look at me.

1659
01:01:33.943 --> 01:01:36.879
I'm not a toy that you play with.

1660
01:01:36.879 --> 01:01:37.947
(It sounds very different.)

1661
01:01:38.214 --> 01:01:39.749
Which language is he speaking?

1662
01:01:39.916 --> 01:01:41.918
He sounds like Lee Jung Soo.

1663
01:01:41.918 --> 01:01:43.786
"Guess who I am?"

1664
01:01:43.853 --> 01:01:46.856
How much will it be? How much would be enough?

1665
01:01:46.856 --> 01:01:48.858
(Jae Seok's acting takes away everyone's attention.)

1666
01:01:48.858 --> 01:01:50.126
She's about to cry.

1667
01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.429
- She's focused. - How can she do that right now?

1668
01:01:53.596 --> 01:01:55.098
- How much... - What can she say to him?

1669
01:01:55.398 --> 01:01:56.766
can you give me?

1670
01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.036
- He became sad. - She made him sad.

1671
01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:02.505
I'm surprised that she became sad.

1672
01:02:03.039 --> 01:02:04.440
I need money.

1673
01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.475
(She tears up.)

1674
01:02:07.643 --> 01:02:09.946
- I don't like it. - How much can you give me?

1675
01:02:10.646 --> 01:02:13.316
(A tear falls.)

1676
01:02:14.117 --> 01:02:15.184
She's crying.

1677
01:02:15.184 --> 01:02:17.186
(It's a drop of an actress' tear.)

1678
01:02:18.287 --> 01:02:24.060
(How will their funny yet touching acting end?)

1679
01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.062
I didn't bring much money today.

1680
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:30.400
Se Mi, I didn't mean it that way.

1681
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.201
- Give it to me. - I didn't think you'd cry.

1682
01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:35.004
I wasn't being serious.

1683
01:02:35.004 --> 01:02:36.339
Give me money.

1684
01:02:36.339 --> 01:02:37.673
How can you cry in such short time?

1685
01:02:37.673 --> 01:02:40.743
- She's amazing. - She's incredible. She cried.

1686
01:02:40.743 --> 01:02:42.211
First place team, please come forward...

1687
01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:44.647
and ask what place another team is in.

1688
01:02:44.647 --> 01:02:47.450
After that, you'll get a hint about the youngest daughter.

1689
01:02:47.717 --> 01:02:49.018
Second place team, please.

1690
01:02:49.318 --> 01:02:50.720
You want to know the second place team?

1691
01:02:51.187 --> 01:02:53.356
The second place team is...

1692
01:02:53.356 --> 01:02:54.924
(Who is in 2nd place that threatens the 1st place?)

1693
01:02:54.924 --> 01:02:56.626
It's Seok Jin and Sung Hee.

1694
01:02:56.626 --> 01:02:59.228
(The 2nd place team is Seok Jin and Sung Hee.)

1695
01:02:59.962 --> 01:03:02.365
(I see. Seok Jin was in 2nd.)

1696
01:03:02.365 --> 01:03:03.566
Really?

1697
01:03:04.867 --> 01:03:07.870
And here's a hint about the youngest daughter.

1698
01:03:09.439 --> 01:03:10.873
(The youngest daughter was not born in Seoul.)

1699
01:03:10.873 --> 01:03:12.608
(Ji Hyo, Ji Min, So Min, Sung Hee, Se Jeong)

1700
01:03:12.608 --> 01:03:14.010
(This hint excludes Se Mi who was born in Seoul.)

1701
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:15.711
This is a difficult hint.

1702
01:03:15.711 --> 01:03:17.246
- It is. - All right.

1703
01:03:18.147 --> 01:03:19.315
This is incredible.

1704
01:03:19.315 --> 01:03:20.450
- Se Chan. - Yes.

1705
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:22.018
Are you the youngest daughter?

1706
01:03:22.218 --> 01:03:24.787
No, I'm the third daughter.

1707
01:03:25.922 --> 01:03:27.824
I mean from here.

1708
01:03:27.824 --> 01:03:29.258
(She wasn't curious about your real family.)

1709
01:03:29.258 --> 01:03:31.360
- What is wrong with you? - I thought she asked me...

1710
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.029
because she liked me.

1711
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:35.832
This was entirely business-related.

1712
01:03:36.065 --> 01:03:38.267
I'm embarrassed for you.

1713
01:03:40.103 --> 01:03:42.238
All the hints have been released.

1714
01:03:42.538 --> 01:03:45.775
- Here is the final mission. - What is it?

1715
01:03:46.008 --> 01:03:48.444
The final mission is a name tag elimination game.

1716
01:03:48.444 --> 01:03:50.646
It's called Inheritance by Ranks.

1717
01:03:50.646 --> 01:03:51.848
(Inheritance by Ranks)

1718
01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:53.749
You have 30 minutes.

1719
01:03:53.749 --> 01:03:56.285
You must find the Walkie-talkies of Truth...

1720
01:03:56.285 --> 01:03:59.388
to find out about the rank above you and rip their name tags.

1721
01:04:00.523 --> 01:04:02.925
However, if you rip the wrong person's name tag,

1722
01:04:02.925 --> 01:04:05.061
you'll get eliminated, so please be careful.

1723
01:04:05.094 --> 01:04:07.363
- It has to be the immediate rank? - Yes, the rank right above.

1724
01:04:07.363 --> 01:04:10.566
What if you're in first place?

1725
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.136
If you're in first place, you must run around.

1726
01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:14.704
That's bad.

1727
01:04:14.704 --> 01:04:17.039
- That's bad. - If you last until the end,

1728
01:04:17.039 --> 01:04:19.041
you'll win in 30 minutes.

1729
01:04:19.041 --> 01:04:21.878
And the youngest daughter...

1730
01:04:21.878 --> 01:04:25.448
can eliminate whomever she wants regardless of the ranks.

1731
01:04:26.149 --> 01:04:28.618
Even if one person in the couple survives, the rank remains.

1732
01:04:29.118 --> 01:04:31.187
At the end of the race, the couple with the highest rank...

1733
01:04:31.187 --> 01:04:33.756
will stand on the platform as potential heirs.

1734
01:04:34.157 --> 01:04:36.526
If you stand on the platform with the youngest daughter,

1735
01:04:36.526 --> 01:04:37.793
the youngest daughter wins.

1736
01:04:37.827 --> 01:04:40.830
If all men are eliminated, the youngest daughter wins as well.

1737
01:04:41.597 --> 01:04:44.500
There are envelopes in the airport containing hints about the daughter.

1738
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.937
The losing team has to change into humiliating costumes.

1739
01:04:47.937 --> 01:04:49.472
Please try your best.

1740
01:04:49.906 --> 01:04:51.741
Each couple will move to different starting points.

1741
01:04:51.741 --> 01:04:53.142
- Okay. - Who is it?

1742
01:04:53.476 --> 01:04:55.378
(Haha and Ji Hyo are in 1st place, Se Chan and Se Jeong are last.)

1743
01:04:55.378 --> 01:04:56.679
There's nobody watching, right?

1744
01:04:56.979 --> 01:04:58.548
We just have to run away.

1745
01:04:58.548 --> 01:05:01.284
We just have to run away and avoid Seok Jin.

1746
01:05:01.284 --> 01:05:02.785
- Yes. - It was Seok Jin earlier.

1747
01:05:02.785 --> 01:05:04.287
If Seok Jin gets eliminated,

1748
01:05:04.287 --> 01:05:05.855
I don't know who the next person is.

1749
01:05:05.855 --> 01:05:08.157
Shouldn't we look for the walkie-talkies too then?

1750
01:05:09.058 --> 01:05:11.227
Let's meet the fourth place team...

1751
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.995
and make them rip the third place.

1752
01:05:13.229 --> 01:05:15.631
But as soon as the 4th place eliminates the 3rd,

1753
01:05:15.631 --> 01:05:17.466
they can eliminate us.

1754
01:05:17.466 --> 01:05:19.068
That's right. They'd rip the third place...

1755
01:05:19.068 --> 01:05:21.370
and then second place.

1756
01:05:22.004 --> 01:05:23.773
You're smart.

1757
01:05:23.773 --> 01:05:25.608
(You're above me.)

1758
01:05:25.608 --> 01:05:27.009
(I'm a smart woman.)

1759
01:05:27.009 --> 01:05:28.578
You're a smart girl.

1760
01:05:29.545 --> 01:05:31.514
(Jong Kook and Ji Min are in 3rd place.)

1761
01:05:31.514 --> 01:05:32.715
Please put it in the middle.

1762
01:05:32.715 --> 01:05:35.084
(They're a threat to everybody.)

1763
01:05:35.084 --> 01:05:36.619
Did you put it on? Let me see.

1764
01:05:37.086 --> 01:05:38.588
We have to make sure it doesn't rip.

1765
01:05:38.588 --> 01:05:40.356
(He presses it down.)

1766
01:05:40.356 --> 01:05:41.624
Gosh, Jong Kook.

1767
01:05:41.624 --> 01:05:43.392
(Jae Seok and Se Mi have to rip Jong Kook and Ji Min's name tags.)

1768
01:05:43.392 --> 01:05:45.027
This is so unfortunate.

1769
01:05:45.061 --> 01:05:46.696
Is it better to rip Jong Kook's name tag...

1770
01:05:46.696 --> 01:05:48.564
or be chased by him?

1771
01:05:49.065 --> 01:05:50.333
I don't like neither.

1772
01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:51.801
(He doesn't know if he can rip Jong Kook's name tag.)

1773
01:05:51.801 --> 01:05:54.203
We can't do anything unless we find the walkie-talkies.

1774
01:05:54.203 --> 01:05:56.005
No, so we have to find them quickly.

1775
01:05:56.138 --> 01:05:57.540
We have to avoid people.

1776
01:05:58.174 --> 01:06:01.043
- It's not bad to be in fifth place. - I agree.

1777
01:06:01.043 --> 01:06:03.779
I thought 1st and 2nd places were good.

1778
01:06:03.779 --> 01:06:06.182
- Sixth place won't go away, right? - No.

1779
01:06:06.582 --> 01:06:09.051
- We'll be chased forever. - What should we do?

1780
01:06:09.051 --> 01:06:10.519
Who's in sixth place?

1781
01:06:11.087 --> 01:06:13.522
Our plan is to...

1782
01:06:13.556 --> 01:06:16.392
find the walkie-talkies and rip people's name tags.

1783
01:06:16.559 --> 01:06:17.994
We probably won't get eliminated.

1784
01:06:18.027 --> 01:06:19.362
We won't get eliminated.

1785
01:06:19.362 --> 01:06:21.097
If somebody eliminates us, they're out.

1786
01:06:21.097 --> 01:06:22.398
We have to pretend like we're a higher rank.

1787
01:06:22.398 --> 01:06:24.233
Right. We have to run around as if we're in first place.

1788
01:06:24.233 --> 01:06:25.601
Okay. I got this.

1789
01:06:26.168 --> 01:06:27.603
Who do you think the youngest princess is?

1790
01:06:27.603 --> 01:06:28.804
She has to run away too.

1791
01:06:28.804 --> 01:06:31.407
It's not princess. It's the youngest daughter.

1792
01:06:31.907 --> 01:06:33.175
If it's you, I'd be so mad.

1793
01:06:33.175 --> 01:06:34.543
- It's not me. - We didn't win once today.

1794
01:06:34.543 --> 01:06:35.711
It's really not me.

1795
01:06:35.711 --> 01:06:36.779
Don't you think it's Se Jeong?

1796
01:06:37.346 --> 01:06:39.649
Let's try to avoid her.

1797
01:06:40.249 --> 01:06:42.518
- I think it's Se Jeong. - Why?

1798
01:06:42.752 --> 01:06:46.389
She is the youngest anyhow.

1799
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:49.125
- She's been on TV a lot too. - We have to...

1800
01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:50.793
We have to take care of her too.

1801
01:06:50.793 --> 01:06:52.561
- She's been on TV a lot too. - I just hope it's not you.

1802
01:06:52.795 --> 01:06:54.964
- You're not the youngest, right? - I'm not.

1803
01:06:54.964 --> 01:06:56.065
I trust you.

1804
01:06:56.065 --> 01:06:57.366
- I'm serious. - Today,

1805
01:06:57.466 --> 01:06:59.435
don't rip my tag in the middle of the game.

1806
01:06:59.435 --> 01:07:00.936
I'm serious, Se Chan.

1807
01:07:00.936 --> 01:07:02.104
- Right? - Yes.

1808
01:07:02.104 --> 01:07:03.272
(Trust me, Se Chan.)

1809
01:07:03.939 --> 01:07:07.476
(Who is the mysterious, youngest daughter?)

1810
01:07:08.077 --> 01:07:09.412
- Race starts. - Okay.

1811
01:07:09.945 --> 01:07:11.080
Come on.

1812
01:07:11.947 --> 01:07:13.082
We have to find it.

1813
01:07:13.649 --> 01:07:16.052
(They have to find the walkie-talkies for the ranks...)

1814
01:07:16.052 --> 01:07:18.354
(and the envelopes that contain hints about the youngest daughter.)

1815
01:07:18.354 --> 01:07:20.790
- I'll look. - Okay. We have to look first.

1816
01:07:22.058 --> 01:07:23.826
- Right now, - Okay.

1817
01:07:24.193 --> 01:07:25.461
people can't rip our name tags yet.

1818
01:07:25.461 --> 01:07:27.697
- We don't know the ranks yet. - Right? We don't know.

1819
01:07:27.697 --> 01:07:29.365
(If you rip the wrong ranks, you'll be out.)

1820
01:07:29.365 --> 01:07:32.268
Let's run away and pretend like we're in first place.

1821
01:07:32.968 --> 01:07:34.236
Let's pretend.

1822
01:07:36.739 --> 01:07:38.007
Exactly.

1823
01:07:38.007 --> 01:07:40.443
- They're not in bathrooms, right? - Probably not.

1824
01:07:40.443 --> 01:07:42.778
They're not in bathrooms. They're usually in rooms.

1825
01:07:43.879 --> 01:07:45.414
It's Seok Jin.

1826
01:07:46.248 --> 01:07:53.956
(Haha and Ji Hyo won the last game and know who's in 2nd place.)

1827
01:07:54.557 --> 01:07:55.858
It's Seok Jin.

1828
01:07:55.858 --> 01:07:57.793
(We have to avoid the 2nd place team.)

1829
01:07:57.793 --> 01:08:00.262
No, Seok Jin might not know yet.

1830
01:08:00.262 --> 01:08:01.597
He might not know about us.

1831
01:08:02.398 --> 01:08:03.632
Let's be careful.

1832
01:08:03.632 --> 01:08:04.834
(Don't make it obvious.)

1833
01:08:05.368 --> 01:08:06.535
Hey.

1834
01:08:07.636 --> 01:08:08.838
(1st and 2nd place teams come across each other.)

1835
01:08:08.838 --> 01:08:11.273
Where are you going?

1836
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:12.908
We're looking for walkie-talkies.

1837
01:08:13.409 --> 01:08:14.543
Where are you going?

1838
01:08:14.543 --> 01:08:16.045
- We're looking for walkie-talkies. - We're looking for them.

1839
01:08:16.145 --> 01:08:17.380
Okay.

1840
01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.215
He doesn't know. Seok Jin doesn't know yet.

1841
01:08:19.215 --> 01:08:20.249
(Giggling)

1842
01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:22.318
The team that's running away...

1843
01:08:22.318 --> 01:08:23.652
- is probably in first place. - Let's go that way.

1844
01:08:23.652 --> 01:08:26.055
The team that tries to get away is in first place.

1845
01:08:26.055 --> 01:08:28.124
- That's right. They're not first. - Right?

1846
01:08:28.124 --> 01:08:29.625
They can't be in first place.

1847
01:08:29.625 --> 01:08:30.826
(He's totally wrong.)

1848
01:08:30.826 --> 01:08:33.028
They were actually looking for walkie-talkies.

1849
01:08:35.798 --> 01:08:37.233
- Se Mi. - Yes?

1850
01:08:37.233 --> 01:08:39.368
(He finds a hint.)

1851
01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:41.737
(It's a hint about the youngest daughter.)

1852
01:08:42.338 --> 01:08:44.473
(The youngest daughter's age is an even number.)

1853
01:08:44.473 --> 01:08:46.575
(The suspects are Sung Hee, Se Jeong, So Min, and Ji Min.)

1854
01:08:46.575 --> 01:08:48.210
It's not Ji Min.

1855
01:08:48.244 --> 01:08:50.312
- I think it's Se Jeong. - Right?

1856
01:08:50.312 --> 01:08:52.181
So Min told me it's not her.

1857
01:08:52.181 --> 01:08:55.117
(This is a secret, but I'll tell you.)

1858
01:08:55.117 --> 01:08:56.552
- Do you trust her? - Should I not?

1859
01:08:56.552 --> 01:08:57.787
You're too naive.

1860
01:08:58.087 --> 01:09:00.156
- It's not true? - What are you doing, Se Mi?

1861
01:09:00.156 --> 01:09:02.324
You'll get eliminated near the beginning.

1862
01:09:02.324 --> 01:09:04.193
I asked everybody.

1863
01:09:04.193 --> 01:09:05.694
- She said it's not her. - Of course.

1864
01:09:05.694 --> 01:09:08.164
So Min is like that.

1865
01:09:08.164 --> 01:09:09.298
I'll try one over.

1866
01:09:09.298 --> 01:09:10.533
(So Min is busy looking for hints.)

1867
01:09:10.533 --> 01:09:11.734
Okay, go.

1868
01:09:11.734 --> 01:09:13.169
(She claims she's not the youngest daughter.)

1869
01:09:13.169 --> 01:09:15.371
(I just need a walkie-talkie or an envelope.)

1870
01:09:17.506 --> 01:09:18.674
Hey!

1871
01:09:18.808 --> 01:09:21.043
(He finds a walkie-talkie.)

1872
01:09:21.043 --> 01:09:22.111
So Min!

1873
01:09:22.478 --> 01:09:23.712
He found one.

1874
01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:25.948
This is driving me nuts.

1875
01:09:26.549 --> 01:09:29.418
- Kwang Soo, you're the best. - Hurry.

1876
01:09:29.418 --> 01:09:31.754
- Trust me. - You're so cool.

1877
01:09:33.823 --> 01:09:35.591
Should we ask for 6th place or 4th?

1878
01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:36.926
(We're in 5th place.)

1879
01:09:37.693 --> 01:09:41.664
(They must avoid 6th place and eliminate 4th place.)

1880
01:09:41.664 --> 01:09:43.232
The couple in fourth place is...

1881
01:09:43.232 --> 01:09:45.434
Jae Seok and Se Mi.

1882
01:09:45.434 --> 01:09:46.535
(They find out who's in 4th place.)

1883
01:09:46.535 --> 01:09:49.705
(Our target is Jae Seok and Se Mi.)

1884
01:09:50.639 --> 01:09:51.907
What is she doing?

1885
01:09:51.941 --> 01:09:53.409
Se Mi, what are you doing?

1886
01:09:53.509 --> 01:09:54.577
Hey.

1887
01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:56.846
- Should we go there? - Who's that?

1888
01:09:57.546 --> 01:09:59.215
- Why? - You scared me.

1889
01:09:59.215 --> 01:10:00.549
- I'm just joking. - Why?

1890
01:10:01.217 --> 01:10:04.386
(He was behind them, so he tried ripping their name tags.)

1891
01:10:04.386 --> 01:10:05.955
You have to be careful.

1892
01:10:05.955 --> 01:10:07.656
- I'm joking. - Be careful.

1893
01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:10.526
- Jae Seok. - Okay.

1894
01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.495
- Why? - It's Kwang Soo.

1895
01:10:12.495 --> 01:10:15.631
(They spot Kwang Soo.)

1896
01:10:15.631 --> 01:10:19.335
(5th place team is here to catch 4th place.)

1897
01:10:19.335 --> 01:10:21.003
Let's get on the elevator first.

1898
01:10:23.739 --> 01:10:25.007
Did you find any hints about the bad girl?

1899
01:10:25.007 --> 01:10:26.242
- What? - Hints about the bad girl.

1900
01:10:26.308 --> 01:10:28.577
Bad girl? Who's that? The youngest daughter?

1901
01:10:30.045 --> 01:10:32.414
- There's Se Mi... - Why are you coming in?

1902
01:10:32.414 --> 01:10:34.216
- Why are you coming in? - What are you doing?

1903
01:10:34.216 --> 01:10:35.284
- What? - Hold on.

1904
01:10:35.284 --> 01:10:36.585
We have something to discuss.

1905
01:10:36.585 --> 01:10:38.687
(Let's rip 4th place.)

1906
01:10:38.854 --> 01:10:40.456
Let's talk first.

1907
01:10:40.456 --> 01:10:41.924
What? What are you doing?

1908
01:10:43.759 --> 01:10:45.127
- I'll help you, Jae Seok. - Please.

1909
01:10:45.127 --> 01:10:47.496
(The higher ranks panic over Kwang Soo's surprise attack.)

1910
01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:48.864
He's in sixth place.

1911
01:10:48.864 --> 01:10:50.032
Let go.

1912
01:10:50.032 --> 01:10:51.300
(He's about to get eliminated.)

1913
01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:54.937
Get out, Se Mi.

1914
01:10:54.937 --> 01:10:56.539
- I have to get out? - Get out, Se Mi.

1915
01:10:56.839 --> 01:10:58.407
Get out. Go.

1916
01:10:58.507 --> 01:10:59.708
No.

1917
01:11:00.476 --> 01:11:01.844
Get out, Se Mi.

1918
01:11:01.844 --> 01:11:03.078
My goodness.

1919
01:11:03.178 --> 01:11:04.413
We ripped it.

1920
01:11:04.647 --> 01:11:09.184
(Jae Seok, who's in 4th place, is out.)

1921
01:11:09.184 --> 01:11:11.887
What now? He's out.

1922
01:11:12.388 --> 01:11:13.656
I'm so mad.

1923
01:11:13.656 --> 01:11:15.357
(Please take care of the rest, Se Mi.)

1924
01:11:15.658 --> 01:11:17.126
We have to find Se Mi.

1925
01:11:17.126 --> 01:11:18.294
- Third place? - Se Mi.

1926
01:11:18.427 --> 01:11:20.362
- Se Mi. - You don't know who she is, right?

1927
01:11:20.362 --> 01:11:22.431
- Is she in 3rd place? - 1 of our guests is Se Mi.

1928
01:11:22.431 --> 01:11:23.732
- She was the one who was crying. - I thought...

1929
01:11:23.732 --> 01:11:25.234
you were talking about third place.

1930
01:11:25.234 --> 01:11:27.870
- Lim Se Mi is her name. - I know who Se Mi is.

1931
01:11:29.438 --> 01:11:30.873
They're there. Come.

1932
01:11:31.407 --> 01:11:33.108
They're there.

1933
01:11:34.009 --> 01:11:35.678
Do you know who's in third place?

1934
01:11:35.945 --> 01:11:38.180
- Do you know who's in second? - I don't know.

1935
01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:39.548
(Let's run away first.)

1936
01:11:39.548 --> 01:11:40.649
So Min.

1937
01:11:41.917 --> 01:11:43.018
Two.

1938
01:11:43.018 --> 01:11:44.853
(They're looking for the right time.)

1939
01:11:44.853 --> 01:11:45.955
Three.

1940
01:11:45.955 --> 01:11:47.089
(It's time to hunt.)

1941
01:11:47.089 --> 01:11:49.124
- You looking for walkie-talkies? - Yes.

1942
01:11:49.224 --> 01:11:51.327
Why are they following us?

1943
01:11:53.829 --> 01:11:55.497
You have to help me.

1944
01:11:55.564 --> 01:11:57.399
You have to help me, Kwang Soo.

1945
01:11:58.534 --> 01:12:00.002
(Dashing)

1946
01:12:00.002 --> 01:12:02.805
(Kwang Soo runs away, and So Min gets caught.)

1947
01:12:02.805 --> 01:12:06.475
(What is So Min's identity?)

1948
01:12:06.475 --> 01:12:08.711
(Her name was included in all the hints.)

1949
01:12:08.711 --> 01:12:11.347
(The youngest daughter was not born in Seoul.)

1950
01:12:11.347 --> 01:12:14.617
(The youngest daughter's age is an even number.)

1951
01:12:14.783 --> 01:12:16.752
(If she's the youngest daughter, there must be a mark.)

1952
01:12:16.752 --> 01:12:18.487
- Rip it. - You can't leave.

1953
01:12:18.587 --> 01:12:19.855
My gosh.

1954
01:12:21.757 --> 01:12:23.058
(Ripping)

1955
01:12:23.058 --> 01:12:27.863
(So Min is out.)

1956
01:12:27.863 --> 01:12:29.098
Kwang Soo, you jerk.

1957
01:12:29.398 --> 01:12:31.900
(She's not the youngest daughter?)

1958
01:12:33.268 --> 01:12:34.536
(Panting)

1959
01:12:36.271 --> 01:12:37.506
Hold on.

1960
01:12:37.506 --> 01:12:38.741
Good job.

1961
01:12:39.108 --> 01:12:41.377
So Min is out. Wait.

1962
01:12:41.377 --> 01:12:42.711
Who eliminated her, Kwang Soo?

1963
01:12:42.711 --> 01:12:44.647
- Se Chan. - I see.

1964
01:12:45.147 --> 01:12:47.216
You're so cheap. You survived?

1965
01:12:47.216 --> 01:12:49.652
(Did you survive by yourself?)

1966
01:12:49.652 --> 01:12:50.919
(Smiling)

1967
01:12:51.854 --> 01:12:53.722
(It's Se Chan.)

1968
01:12:53.722 --> 01:12:55.257
Wait.

1969
01:12:55.257 --> 01:12:56.258
- Rip it. - Wait.

1970
01:12:56.258 --> 01:12:57.292
Okay.

1971
01:12:57.292 --> 01:12:58.360
(He's a rat in a trap.)

1972
01:12:58.761 --> 01:13:00.496
Listen to me.

1973
01:13:00.496 --> 01:13:02.965
- I can't rip your name tag. - I'm going to wear the costume.

1974
01:13:02.965 --> 01:13:04.333
- I... - But...

1975
01:13:04.333 --> 01:13:05.868
- What? - Listen to me.

1976
01:13:06.068 --> 01:13:07.503
There's no time for this.

1977
01:13:07.736 --> 01:13:09.738
(Slapping)

1978
01:13:10.272 --> 01:13:12.374
- What? - I told you to listen to me.

1979
01:13:12.374 --> 01:13:13.976
- Come here. - Let's go.

1980
01:13:13.976 --> 01:13:15.010
Come.

1981
01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:17.046
Come in. I'm so happy.

1982
01:13:17.179 --> 01:13:18.747
I'm so happy now.

1983
01:13:18.747 --> 01:13:19.848
(Come on, Se Chan.)

1984
01:13:19.848 --> 01:13:21.750
Look at you.

1985
01:13:22.384 --> 01:13:25.254
Fifth place is out.

1986
01:13:25.254 --> 01:13:26.388
(Kwang Soo and So Min are out.)

1987
01:13:27.022 --> 01:13:29.625
Let's find some walkie-talkies. Where are they?

1988
01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:33.028
We survived until now. The war has begun, Sung Hee.

1989
01:13:33.028 --> 01:13:34.196
Let's just...

1990
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:35.464
Who's that?

1991
01:13:35.464 --> 01:13:36.632
(She's anxious because she survived on her own.)

1992
01:13:36.899 --> 01:13:38.200
It's Se Mi.

1993
01:13:38.567 --> 01:13:39.735
Isn't that Se Mi?

1994
01:13:39.735 --> 01:13:42.271
(Se Chan and Se Jeong find their next target.)

1995
01:13:42.271 --> 01:13:44.406
That couple has nothing to do with me.

1996
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.542
- Did you find any hints? - What?

1997
01:13:46.608 --> 01:13:49.178
- Nothing. - Let me tell you something.

1998
01:13:49.912 --> 01:13:51.714
- You have to watch out for... - Where is he?

1999
01:13:51.714 --> 01:13:53.415
- Jong Kook. - Where is he?

2000
01:13:53.415 --> 01:13:56.051
- You have to watch out for him. - What?

2001
01:13:56.051 --> 01:13:57.753
- But why... - No.

2002
01:13:57.753 --> 01:13:59.521
(Grabbing)

2003
01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:01.423
- No, no. - Why?

2004
01:14:01.457 --> 01:14:04.593
It's not me.

2005
01:14:04.593 --> 01:14:06.695
Jae Seok, no!

2006
01:14:06.995 --> 01:14:08.230
(Ripping)

2007
01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:10.666
(Se Mi is out.)

2008
01:14:10.666 --> 01:14:11.967
Thank you.

2009
01:14:12.468 --> 01:14:14.069
I'm done.

2010
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:16.939
I'm done for.

2011
01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.775
Those liars.

2012
01:14:19.775 --> 01:14:21.076
(Jae Seok, Se Mi, Kwang Soo, and So Min are out.)

2013
01:14:21.076 --> 01:14:24.246
Have you seen Jong Kook? Where is he?

2014
01:14:24.246 --> 01:14:27.282
(Se Chan and Se Jeong got a hint on the 3rd place couple.)

2015
01:14:27.282 --> 01:14:28.317
The envelope.

2016
01:14:29.451 --> 01:14:32.321
- I get so lucky with you. - Exactly.

2017
01:14:33.856 --> 01:14:36.158
Necklace and ring. Have you seen anybody with this?

2018
01:14:36.158 --> 01:14:37.826
(The hint is about jewelries.)

2019
01:14:38.127 --> 01:14:42.664
(Necklace, bracelet, and ankle bracelet shaped like airplanes)

2020
01:14:43.899 --> 01:14:45.634
Have you seen anybody with this?

2021
01:14:45.634 --> 01:14:46.635
Who is it?

2022
01:14:46.635 --> 01:14:47.903
(I know.)

2023
01:14:47.903 --> 01:14:49.404
Who is it?

2024
01:14:49.605 --> 01:14:51.507
She tied the scarf here.

2025
01:14:51.507 --> 01:14:53.175
(She tied the scarf here.)

2026
01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:56.078
(The person with a scarf around their ankle...)

2027
01:14:56.078 --> 01:14:57.579
The person who cursed... I mean...

2028
01:14:57.946 --> 01:15:00.149
- Sung Hee? Is it her? - Yes.

2029
01:15:01.617 --> 01:15:04.853
I tied it here, but she tied it around her ankle.

2030
01:15:04.853 --> 01:15:06.889
She doesn't want to be on the same team as you.

2031
01:15:06.889 --> 01:15:10.692
(Unlike her partner, Seok Jin, she tied it around her ankle.)

2032
01:15:10.692 --> 01:15:12.394
You hid it perfectly.

2033
01:15:12.394 --> 01:15:14.496
(Is Sung Hee really the youngest daughter?)

2034
01:15:15.597 --> 01:15:17.633
That's why she tied it here.

2035
01:15:17.666 --> 01:15:19.134
- To hide it? - Yes.

2036
01:15:20.402 --> 01:15:22.504
Sixth place...

2037
01:15:22.838 --> 01:15:25.440
is fifth place now, and they...

2038
01:15:25.974 --> 01:15:27.509
- The scariest thing is... - Okay!

2039
01:15:27.509 --> 01:15:30.412
(He finds a hint about the youngest daughter.)

2040
01:15:30.412 --> 01:15:32.414
Okay!

2041
01:15:32.514 --> 01:15:35.384
I found it. Seok Jin.

2042
01:15:35.484 --> 01:15:36.785
You found it.

2043
01:15:36.785 --> 01:15:38.587
(Let me see.)

2044
01:15:38.587 --> 01:15:39.755
(The youngest daughter is in her 20s.)

2045
01:15:39.755 --> 01:15:46.495
(The suspects are Sung Hee and Se Jeong.)

2046
01:15:46.495 --> 01:15:47.896
(Turning)

2047
01:15:47.996 --> 01:15:50.199
It's not me.

2048
01:15:50.465 --> 01:15:52.768
- It's really not me. - Sung Hee.

2049
01:15:52.768 --> 01:15:55.204
Sung Hee, it's you.

2050
01:15:55.204 --> 01:15:57.539
Why? Because it didn't have Se Jeong's name earlier?

2051
01:15:59.808 --> 01:16:04.847
(He found a hint earlier.)

2052
01:16:04.847 --> 01:16:09.117
(If you combine the hints, it has to be Sung Hee.)

2053
01:16:09.117 --> 01:16:11.787
- It's you. - It's not, Seok Jin.

2054
01:16:11.787 --> 01:16:14.356
- Sung Hee. - Fine, it's me.

2055
01:16:14.823 --> 01:16:16.058
Don't rip mine.

2056
01:16:16.058 --> 01:16:18.060
Let's make a deal. Okay. Then...

2057
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.494
Look at her. You startled me.

2058
01:16:19.494 --> 01:16:21.797
(You know my identity now.)

2059
01:16:22.664 --> 01:16:25.834
(Her name was included...)

2060
01:16:25.834 --> 01:16:30.405
(in all the hints.)

2061
01:16:30.405 --> 01:16:33.675
(She was hiding her identity...)

2062
01:16:33.675 --> 01:16:37.246
(just like she was hiding the ankle bracelet.)

2063
01:16:37.246 --> 01:16:42.551
(Sung Hee is the youngest daughter.)

2064
01:16:42.551 --> 01:16:45.053
- Then... - You're the only one with both.

2065
01:16:45.053 --> 01:16:47.522
Seok Jin.

2066
01:16:47.522 --> 01:16:49.558
- I won't do it. - Don't rip my name tag.

2067
01:16:49.558 --> 01:16:51.460
It's not beneficial for me to be alone.

2068
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.794
Exactly. You won't do it, right?

2069
01:16:52.794 --> 01:16:55.230
Seok Jin, the third place is important to us.

2070
01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:56.665
- It is. - Right.

2071
01:16:56.665 --> 01:16:58.901
You should rip their name tags.

2072
01:17:00.469 --> 01:17:01.603
(These two couples are are in confrontation.)

2073
01:17:01.603 --> 01:17:02.938
Why are you here?

2074
01:17:03.272 --> 01:17:04.907
Somebody has to rip theirs.

2075
01:17:05.641 --> 01:17:06.708
- Right? - Yes.

2076
01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:08.310
(They're all gathered there.)

2077
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:10.579
- Sixth place has to... - They're there.

2078
01:17:10.913 --> 01:17:12.247
- That's true. - Haha.

2079
01:17:12.281 --> 01:17:15.517
I think Seok Jin knows that we're in first place.

2080
01:17:15.717 --> 01:17:18.220
- Really? - We have to get away.

2081
01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.554
Let's get away.

2082
01:17:19.554 --> 01:17:20.622
(They retreat.)

2083
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:23.125
All of a sudden?

2084
01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:24.626
- Why? Who are they after? - Let's get them.

2085
01:17:24.626 --> 01:17:25.694
(Let's get them, Sung Hee.)

2086
01:17:25.694 --> 01:17:27.396
(The youngest daughter is on her way.)

2087
01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:29.197
I think it's her.

2088
01:17:29.298 --> 01:17:31.633
- They went that way. - Did she get them?

2089
01:17:32.401 --> 01:17:33.568
Why are you running away?

2090
01:17:34.536 --> 01:17:37.072
- Hey. - Why are they leaving?

2091
01:17:37.072 --> 01:17:39.574
Jong Kook is in third place. They might be after us.

2092
01:17:39.574 --> 01:17:41.143
(Haha and Ji Hyo are running away. Is Jong Kook in 3rd?)

2093
01:17:41.143 --> 01:17:43.412
Hold on. Jong Kook is still alive.

2094
01:17:43.412 --> 01:17:44.746
Haha is in first place.

2095
01:17:44.746 --> 01:17:48.450
Right. Jong Kook can't rip Haha's.

2096
01:17:48.483 --> 01:17:51.286
Seok Jin was next to Jong Kook and Haha.

2097
01:17:51.286 --> 01:17:53.422
- Seok Jin is in second place. - Right.

2098
01:17:53.422 --> 01:17:54.856
Haha is in first place.

2099
01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:56.625
Let's tell them we're in first place.

2100
01:17:56.625 --> 01:17:59.428
(Let's tell Jong Kook we're in first place.)

2101
01:17:59.428 --> 01:18:01.096
- What? - He'll be relieved.

2102
01:18:01.096 --> 01:18:02.397
- That's right. - Right.

2103
01:18:03.398 --> 01:18:05.334
Tell me what that was about.

2104
01:18:05.334 --> 01:18:07.102
- What? - Tell me what the situation was.

2105
01:18:07.102 --> 01:18:08.170
(He's not an easy opponent.)

2106
01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:09.871
You're suspicious of us, so we'll stay here.

2107
01:18:09.871 --> 01:18:11.206
What?

2108
01:18:11.206 --> 01:18:12.341
The situation?

2109
01:18:12.674 --> 01:18:14.710
The nursing room doesn't suit you.

2110
01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:16.812
(The nursing room doesn't suit you.)

2111
01:18:16.812 --> 01:18:18.714
(He's illegally occupying it.)

2112
01:18:18.714 --> 01:18:20.048
I got kidnapped.

2113
01:18:20.048 --> 01:18:21.917
Hold on, Jong Kook.

2114
01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:23.819
- What place are you in? - Us?

2115
01:18:23.852 --> 01:18:26.188
- This is civil defense. - What?

2116
01:18:26.388 --> 01:18:27.622
We're one of you.

2117
01:18:27.689 --> 01:18:29.124
What place are you in?

2118
01:18:29.191 --> 01:18:30.759
There's no point in hiding.

2119
01:18:30.759 --> 01:18:32.594
- What place are you in? - Are you in sixth place?

2120
01:18:32.627 --> 01:18:34.396
- We're in first place. - Are you sure?

2121
01:18:34.696 --> 01:18:36.531
- Touch my hand. - Are you sure about that?

2122
01:18:36.531 --> 01:18:37.599
Touch my hand.

2123
01:18:37.599 --> 01:18:38.800
Check.

2124
01:18:39.234 --> 01:18:40.469
You always check.

2125
01:18:40.469 --> 01:18:42.304
Do you have any hints about the youngest daughter?

2126
01:18:43.338 --> 01:18:44.373
Let me see your ankle.

2127
01:18:44.373 --> 01:18:46.308
- What? - Your ankle. Move your sock.

2128
01:18:46.308 --> 01:18:48.310
- The ankle bracelet? - Right.

2129
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:49.878
- It's Sung Hee. - It's her.

2130
01:18:50.979 --> 01:18:52.814
- She's wearing the ankle bracelet. - She is.

2131
01:18:52.814 --> 01:18:54.216
Let's form an alliance.

2132
01:18:54.216 --> 01:18:55.784
Is she the youngest daughter then?

2133
01:18:55.784 --> 01:18:56.918
She has to be.

2134
01:18:56.918 --> 01:18:58.587
Let's do this. Let's form an alliance.

2135
01:18:58.587 --> 01:19:00.756
- Are you in first place? - Yes.

2136
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:02.557
Jong Kook.

2137
01:19:02.557 --> 01:19:04.726
- We're on the same side. - We're in third place.

2138
01:19:04.893 --> 01:19:06.695
Really? It doesn't matter then.

2139
01:19:06.695 --> 01:19:08.497
That's why they were trying to eliminate us.

2140
01:19:08.497 --> 01:19:09.931
I see.

2141
01:19:09.931 --> 01:19:11.833
The youngest daughter shouldn't win.

2142
01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:13.402
She's in second place.

2143
01:19:13.402 --> 01:19:15.203
This is good. Let's do this.

2144
01:19:15.203 --> 01:19:18.206
I'll let you win.

2145
01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:20.375
You look out for Haha and Ji Hyo...

2146
01:19:20.375 --> 01:19:21.610
so that we can...

2147
01:19:21.977 --> 01:19:24.279
get the name tag of the couple in second place.

2148
01:19:24.479 --> 01:19:25.914
Sounds good?

2149
01:19:26.148 --> 01:19:28.183
Okay. You have to think fast.

2150
01:19:28.183 --> 01:19:30.986
- I should feel sorry for your team. - We're beggars.

2151
01:19:30.986 --> 01:19:34.322
You gained an army now. I'll protect you.

2152
01:19:34.322 --> 01:19:36.124
(Will Se Chan trick Jong Kook and eliminate the 3rd place team?)

2153
01:19:36.858 --> 01:19:39.895
It's too easy to eliminate you guys.

2154
01:19:40.729 --> 01:19:41.830
Guys.

2155
01:19:42.497 --> 01:19:44.666
- I'm taking care of you. - Thank you.

2156
01:19:44.666 --> 01:19:47.469
We don't have much time left.

2157
01:19:47.469 --> 01:19:48.503
(They have to find the youngest daughter quickly.)

2158
01:19:48.503 --> 01:19:50.105
Jong Kook, there's a mission card.

2159
01:19:50.105 --> 01:19:51.206
- Where? - Where?

2160
01:19:51.206 --> 01:19:53.909
- There it is. - Here it is.

2161
01:19:54.509 --> 01:19:55.877
It's about the youngest daughter.

2162
01:19:55.877 --> 01:19:57.412
Three people? It's not me.

2163
01:19:57.412 --> 01:20:00.015
- It's Sung Hee, right? - It must be her picture.

2164
01:20:00.782 --> 01:20:01.850
It's Sung Hee.

2165
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:05.353
(It's her picture from her teenage days.)

2166
01:20:05.353 --> 01:20:06.388
(Is this really Sung Hee?)

2167
01:20:06.388 --> 01:20:07.689
Put it in your bag.

2168
01:20:10.192 --> 01:20:12.527
One thing I'm sure about is...

2169
01:20:12.561 --> 01:20:14.262
the lip shape.

2170
01:20:14.496 --> 01:20:17.265
(Se Jeong distracts Jong Kook with the picture.)

2171
01:20:17.265 --> 01:20:18.834
The shape is...

2172
01:20:18.834 --> 01:20:20.268
(Ripping)

2173
01:20:20.268 --> 01:20:22.804
(He ripped Jong Kook's name tag.)

2174
01:20:22.804 --> 01:20:23.905
(He eliminates Jong Kook boldly.)

2175
01:20:23.905 --> 01:20:25.173
Why did you do that? What?

2176
01:20:25.173 --> 01:20:26.308
(Jong Kook was in 3rd place.)

2177
01:20:26.308 --> 01:20:27.375
You scared me.

2178
01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:28.410
(Sudden change)

2179
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:31.847
(Ji Min is helpless as well.)

2180
01:20:31.847 --> 01:20:33.849
I knew it.

2181
01:20:33.849 --> 01:20:35.584
You give me goosebumps.

2182
01:20:35.584 --> 01:20:36.618
(They got backstabbed by sixth place.)

2183
01:20:37.018 --> 01:20:38.553
- What are we supposed to do? - You scared me.

2184
01:20:38.553 --> 01:20:40.355
(They take out the 3rd place team.)

2185
01:20:40.889 --> 01:20:44.826
Third place team, Jong Kook and Ji Min, are out.

2186
01:20:45.827 --> 01:20:46.995
Really?

2187
01:20:47.729 --> 01:20:50.365
- Ji Min? - Se Chan ripped everybody's.

2188
01:20:50.499 --> 01:20:52.167
Se Chan will win.

2189
01:20:52.167 --> 01:20:54.302
There are Seok Jin and Haha left.

2190
01:20:54.302 --> 01:20:55.804
(There are only 3 teams left.)

2191
01:20:55.804 --> 01:20:58.006
That was awesome. Doesn't this narrow it down?

2192
01:20:58.006 --> 01:20:59.074
It does.

2193
01:20:59.074 --> 01:21:00.242
(Will Se Chan and Se Jeong turn the table around?)

2194
01:21:00.275 --> 01:21:01.576
Se Chan is in sixth place.

2195
01:21:01.576 --> 01:21:03.912
- Haha. - They know now.

2196
01:21:04.346 --> 01:21:05.580
They know now.

2197
01:21:05.914 --> 01:21:07.382
They're there.

2198
01:21:07.382 --> 01:21:08.750
We have to eliminate them.

2199
01:21:09.217 --> 01:21:10.752
Haha is not in sixth place.

2200
01:21:11.353 --> 01:21:13.488
He's in 1st place. He can't be 6th. Hurry.

2201
01:21:13.688 --> 01:21:15.524
He's there. Come.

2202
01:21:15.524 --> 01:21:17.159
- I think they're in sixth place. - Right.

2203
01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.496
(Who will be the ultimate winner?)

2204
01:21:22.697 --> 01:21:24.099
Who's the youngest daughter?

2205
01:21:24.099 --> 01:21:26.535
From my first hint, Ji Min was excluded.

2206
01:21:26.535 --> 01:21:27.536
That's right.

2207
01:21:27.536 --> 01:21:30.405
From the second hint, it was either So Min or Se Jeong.

2208
01:21:30.405 --> 01:21:31.806
- That's right. - We didn't have Se Jeong.

2209
01:21:31.806 --> 01:21:33.842
- From your hint, - Se Jeong wasn't there.

2210
01:21:33.842 --> 01:21:35.443
Se Jeong isn't there. Who is it then?

2211
01:21:35.443 --> 01:21:36.912
Put our hints together.

2212
01:21:36.912 --> 01:21:39.848
(If you exclude Se Jeong from So Min and Se Jeong, who is it?)

2213
01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:42.784
Is it you?

2214
01:21:42.784 --> 01:21:44.986
It's not me.

2215
01:21:47.155 --> 01:21:50.025
(When So Min was eliminated earlier)

2216
01:21:50.025 --> 01:21:51.126
Kwang Soo is so mean.

2217
01:21:51.126 --> 01:21:53.461
(She didn't have the red writing that said she's youngest daughter.)

2218
01:21:54.062 --> 01:21:59.968
(But the hints with So Min's name don't have Sung Hee on them.)

2219
01:22:01.636 --> 01:22:06.174
(Some hints include Sung Hee and some don't. What do they mean?)

2220
01:22:06.174 --> 01:22:10.712
(Each hint has different number of airplanes on them.)

2221
01:22:11.546 --> 01:22:14.382
If So Min says it's not her,

2222
01:22:14.516 --> 01:22:17.018
that means the heir... Or the youngest daughter is...

2223
01:22:17.018 --> 01:22:18.753
is not just one person.

2224
01:22:19.688 --> 01:22:23.124
(The youngest daughter is not one person?)

2225
01:22:24.492 --> 01:22:27.729
(There's another youngest daughter besides Sung Hee?)

2226
01:22:29.798 --> 01:22:31.766
Rip Seok Jin's name tag. He's there.

2227
01:22:31.766 --> 01:22:33.568
- Let's rip his name tag... - Yes.

2228
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:36.071
What's this?

2229
01:22:36.938 --> 01:22:38.406
(Ripping)

2230
01:22:38.807 --> 01:22:41.409
(Se Jeong rips Se Chan's name tag.)

2231
01:22:43.612 --> 01:22:44.713
Thank you.

2232
01:22:44.946 --> 01:22:48.116
We don't need to be together anymore.

2233
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:51.219
(The fact that Se Jeong can rip a team member's name tag means...)

2234
01:22:51.219 --> 01:22:54.823
(she is also the youngest daughter.)

2235
01:22:54.823 --> 01:23:00.395
(Sung Hee and Se Jeong are twins who were separated.)

2236
01:23:00.395 --> 01:23:05.100
(The two youngest daughters already know about each other.)

2237
01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.535
- I think it's Se Jeong. - Why?

2238
01:23:07.602 --> 01:23:11.206
She is the youngest member.

2239
01:23:11.206 --> 01:23:13.375
(Sung Hee framed Se Jeong,)

2240
01:23:13.375 --> 01:23:17.479
(and Se Jeong framed Sung Hee.)

2241
01:23:17.479 --> 01:23:21.850
(They made others think there was only one youngest daughter.)

2242
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:24.419
(The youngest daughters' survival method is chilling.)

2243
01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.655
Who are you?

2244
01:23:26.655 --> 01:23:28.290
- Go. - Are you the youngest daughter?

2245
01:23:28.456 --> 01:23:30.225
- Hurry up, and go. - Tell me.

2246
01:23:30.225 --> 01:23:32.827
Tell the others that Jong Kook ripped your name tag.

2247
01:23:32.827 --> 01:23:34.863
Bye. Bye.

2248
01:23:34.863 --> 01:23:37.232
Does that mean there are triplets?

2249
01:23:37.232 --> 01:23:39.501
(Triplets?)

2250
01:23:40.869 --> 01:23:43.004
(The two teams found a hint earlier.)

2251
01:23:43.004 --> 01:23:44.839
- It's Sung Hee, right? - It must be her picture.

2252
01:23:44.839 --> 01:23:47.042
(It was a picture of the triplets.)

2253
01:23:47.309 --> 01:23:49.377
(The triplets are...)

2254
01:23:49.377 --> 01:23:50.845
(Sung Hee, Se Jeong,)

2255
01:23:50.845 --> 01:23:51.980
This is the prison.

2256
01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:53.348
(and...)

2257
01:23:53.648 --> 01:23:54.716
What was that?

2258
01:23:54.716 --> 01:23:55.884
(Ripping)

2259
01:23:55.884 --> 01:23:58.420
(Ji Hyo, are you one of them?)

2260
01:23:58.420 --> 01:23:59.454
Haha.

2261
01:24:00.322 --> 01:24:01.389
I am sorry, Haha.

2262
01:24:01.389 --> 01:24:02.791
(Are you surprised?)

2263
01:24:03.058 --> 01:24:06.027
I will give you half if I receive the inheritance.

2264
01:24:08.296 --> 01:24:11.466
(The youngest daughters the chairman lost...)

2265
01:24:11.466 --> 01:24:14.936
(were triplets, Se Jeong, Sung Hee, and Ji Hyo.)

2266
01:24:15.704 --> 01:24:19.908
(The necklace, bracelet, and anklet symbolize the triplets.)

2267
01:24:20.442 --> 01:24:24.879
(The number of paper airplanes signify each daughter.)

2268
01:24:26.448 --> 01:24:29.050
(The 3 airplanes in the banners symbolize the triplets.)

2269
01:24:30.352 --> 01:24:32.287
(The crucial evidence is...)

2270
01:24:32.287 --> 01:24:34.155
(the picture of the triplets.)

2271
01:24:34.155 --> 01:24:38.026
You are the triplets the chairman lost.

2272
01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:39.994
We are a team.

2273
01:24:40.695 --> 01:24:43.465
We don't have to betray each other until the end, right?

2274
01:24:44.766 --> 01:24:47.001
Thank goodness. Thank you.

2275
01:24:47.001 --> 01:24:49.504
(That's how the triplets' drama unfolded.)

2276
01:24:50.538 --> 01:24:53.208
(Now, the man in first place, Haha, is out.)

2277
01:24:53.208 --> 01:24:55.744
(That means...)

2278
01:24:55.744 --> 01:24:58.713
(their only hope is Seok Jin.)

2279
01:24:58.713 --> 01:25:02.217
(The brothers win if Seok Jin holds out for a minute.)

2280
01:25:02.217 --> 01:25:03.385
Where is Haha?

2281
01:25:03.885 --> 01:25:04.953
Haha.

2282
01:25:04.953 --> 01:25:06.454
(Seok Jin is still looking for Haha.)

2283
01:25:06.454 --> 01:25:09.424
(He only needs to wander for another 40 seconds.)

2284
01:25:09.424 --> 01:25:10.458
Hey.

2285
01:25:11.059 --> 01:25:13.528
What happened?

2286
01:25:14.028 --> 01:25:16.698
(The first place, Haha, is out.)

2287
01:25:17.031 --> 01:25:18.900
Are you out? By whom?

2288
01:25:19.534 --> 01:25:20.602
Me.

2289
01:25:20.602 --> 01:25:22.904
(Scary)

2290
01:25:22.904 --> 01:25:23.938
Hey!

2291
01:25:24.072 --> 01:25:26.074
Rip her name tag. I was wrong.

2292
01:25:26.074 --> 01:25:27.509
(My goodness.)

2293
01:25:27.509 --> 01:25:28.843
(Both of them were daughters.)

2294
01:25:28.843 --> 01:25:30.812
You fool!

2295
01:25:30.812 --> 01:25:32.380
Rip his name tag.

2296
01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.381
What are you doing?

2297
01:25:33.381 --> 01:25:34.883
(Ripping)

2298
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:38.052
(The last son, Seok Jin, is out.)

2299
01:25:38.052 --> 01:25:39.687
I was used.

2300
01:25:40.355 --> 01:25:41.823
- Ji Hyo. - I was used.

2301
01:25:41.823 --> 01:25:42.957
You are on the same side.

2302
01:25:43.057 --> 01:25:44.959
We won.

2303
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.896
I need to talk to the others.

2304
01:25:48.563 --> 01:25:51.566
Se Jeong, I am about to cry.

2305
01:25:51.699 --> 01:25:53.001
I am about to cry.

2306
01:25:53.001 --> 01:25:55.136
(I had a beautiful dream.)

2307
01:25:57.305 --> 01:25:59.040
(She takes off her scarf.)

2308
01:26:01.242 --> 01:26:02.343
What is that?

2309
01:26:03.044 --> 01:26:04.145
What is that?

2310
01:26:04.546 --> 01:26:07.248
(The necklace, symbol of the triplets, appears.)

2311
01:26:07.916 --> 01:26:10.018
It's the symbol.

2312
01:26:10.018 --> 01:26:11.453
(That's the hint I saw earlier.)

2313
01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.655
(The triplets win...)

2314
01:26:13.655 --> 01:26:17.859
(by hiding their necklace, bracelet, and anklet perfectly.)

2315
01:26:19.694 --> 01:26:22.464
We will reveal the final result...

2316
01:26:22.464 --> 01:26:24.065
of Crisis of the Family, Return of Heiress.

2317
01:26:24.532 --> 01:26:27.202
Congratulations. The final heiresses are...

2318
01:26:27.202 --> 01:26:30.605
the youngest daughters, Ji Hyo, Sung Hee, and Se Jeong.

2319
01:26:30.605 --> 01:26:32.207
(The final heiresses are Ji Hyo, Sung Hee, and Se Jeong.)

2320
01:26:32.207 --> 01:26:33.675
I had no idea they were triplets.

2321
01:26:33.675 --> 01:26:36.377
Come to think of it, we're all a family.

2322
01:26:37.312 --> 01:26:38.513
(Ji Hyo, Sung Hee, and Se Jeong get gold airplane badges.)

2323
01:26:38.513 --> 01:26:39.547
They're badges.

2324
01:26:39.848 --> 01:26:41.216
- It's gold. - Really?

2325
01:26:41.349 --> 01:26:44.786
The youngest daughters will discuss among themselves...

2326
01:26:44.786 --> 01:26:47.956
and choose three people who will wear humiliating costumes.

2327
01:26:47.956 --> 01:26:49.657
- 3 people? - 3 people?

2328
01:26:50.892 --> 01:26:54.395
(These airport costumes are completely ridiculous.)

2329
01:26:54.395 --> 01:26:57.866
(3 people are fated to roam the airport in them.)

2330
01:26:57.899 --> 01:27:01.803
(The youngest daughters hold their fates.)

2331
01:27:01.803 --> 01:27:03.304
- We have decided. - Okay.

2332
01:27:03.304 --> 01:27:06.908
We played rock-paper-scissors.

2333
01:27:07.442 --> 01:27:08.576
I lost.

2334
01:27:08.576 --> 01:27:09.978
(Confident)

2335
01:27:09.978 --> 01:27:11.012
- What does that mean? - That means...

2336
01:27:11.346 --> 01:27:12.680
you will have to wear it.

2337
01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.517
- Haha. - Since Ji Hyo lost,

2338
01:27:15.517 --> 01:27:16.518
Haha will wear the costume.

2339
01:27:16.518 --> 01:27:18.453
I can't believe you.

2340
01:27:18.453 --> 01:27:21.823
We decided to exempt these two girls' partners.

2341
01:27:21.823 --> 01:27:24.559
- Why would you do that? - Okay!

2342
01:27:24.859 --> 01:27:26.694
We played rock-paper-scissors to be fair.

2343
01:27:26.694 --> 01:27:28.296
That means one of us will be exempt.

2344
01:27:28.296 --> 01:27:29.397
(Jong Kook, Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo remain.)

2345
01:27:29.764 --> 01:27:31.466
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2346
01:27:31.466 --> 01:27:33.434
Let's play rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors

2347
01:27:35.036 --> 01:27:37.305
- Yes! - I lost.

2348
01:27:37.305 --> 01:27:38.573
Good luck.

2349
01:27:38.573 --> 01:27:40.475
Only one person will be exempt.

2350
01:27:40.475 --> 01:27:42.277
My goodness. In that case,

2351
01:27:43.077 --> 01:27:45.046
let's have the loser wear this outfit.

2352
01:27:45.046 --> 01:27:47.015
- Which one? - The loser wears this outfit.

2353
01:27:47.148 --> 01:27:49.918
It will look good on Kwang Soo.

2354
01:27:50.218 --> 01:27:52.153
- We have one round, right? - Yes.

2355
01:27:52.153 --> 01:27:54.122
While they look like penalty costumes,

2356
01:27:54.122 --> 01:27:55.123
this one doesn't.

2357
01:27:55.123 --> 01:27:56.791
It will make one look like he tried his best to look cool.

2358
01:27:56.791 --> 01:27:59.227
This would be the worst.

2359
01:27:59.227 --> 01:28:00.295
(Who is fated to wear the sparkling costume?)

2360
01:28:00.295 --> 01:28:01.396
This would be the worst.

2361
01:28:01.396 --> 01:28:02.897
Seriously.

2362
01:28:03.031 --> 01:28:04.132
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2363
01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:10.038
(Kwang Soo is chosen.)

2364
01:28:11.039 --> 01:28:14.008
(He is familiar with this kind of outfits.)

2365
01:28:14.008 --> 01:28:16.044
- My goodness. - I feel bad for him.

2366
01:28:16.778 --> 01:28:18.379
- Will you be okay? - My goodness.

2367
01:28:18.379 --> 01:28:20.248
(It's time to see the runway at the airport.)

2368
01:28:21.416 --> 01:28:24.786
(Terminal 1 and Terminal 2)

2369
01:28:24.786 --> 01:28:25.954
People at the airport will go into a frenzy.

2370
01:28:26.387 --> 01:28:28.990
(They arrive at the airport.)

2371
01:28:30.925 --> 01:28:32.493
(Laughing)

2372
01:28:32.493 --> 01:28:35.763
- It looks like Kwang Soo owns it. - I knew it.

2373
01:28:35.763 --> 01:28:37.131
- It looks like Kwang Soo owns it. - Look at Haha.

2374
01:28:37.398 --> 01:28:39.634
Jong Kook and Haha look fine.

2375
01:28:39.634 --> 01:28:41.235
Look at Kwang Soo.

2376
01:28:41.235 --> 01:28:43.338
It looks like Kwang Soo is wearing his own clothes.

2377
01:28:43.338 --> 01:28:44.439
I know.

2378
01:28:44.839 --> 01:28:47.141
It looks like he is wearing his unique clothes.

2379
01:28:47.141 --> 01:28:49.377
It will be a popular look in Japan.

2380
01:28:50.545 --> 01:28:52.013
Aren't you wearing...

2381
01:28:52.013 --> 01:28:53.414
your own clothes?

2382
01:28:53.414 --> 01:28:54.849
You look like you dressed up.

2383
01:28:54.849 --> 01:28:57.452
People are just disgruntled to see us.

2384
01:28:57.785 --> 01:29:00.288
This is embarrassing.

2385
01:29:00.588 --> 01:29:02.523
Let's stay together.

2386
01:29:02.523 --> 01:29:04.792
I need to stay with you guys.

2387
01:29:05.326 --> 01:29:07.795
- This is embarrassing. - Isn't this enough?

2388
01:29:07.795 --> 01:29:10.098
This is a penalty.

2389
01:29:10.098 --> 01:29:12.467
Kwang Soo, why did you dress yourself that way?

2390
01:29:12.467 --> 01:29:14.002
This is a penalty.

2391
01:29:14.002 --> 01:29:15.003
(The departure...)

2392
01:29:15.003 --> 01:29:17.138
(is hard from the start.)

2393
01:29:17.639 --> 01:29:19.040
(Next week,)

2394
01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.543
(the penalty for Half and Half Tour will begin.)

2395
01:29:22.543 --> 01:29:24.512
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok go to Cage of Death.)

2396
01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.649
(They waited a long time.)

2397
01:29:28.016 --> 01:29:31.019
(Se Chan and Haha go to Nevis Swing.)

2398
01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:35.023
(Unprecedented)

2399
01:29:35.023 --> 01:29:37.425
(Unbelievable)

2400
01:29:37.959 --> 01:29:41.963
(The realness shocks the members with 7 years of experience.)

2401
01:29:42.864 --> 01:29:46.167
(More shocking,)

2402
01:29:46.167 --> 01:29:49.604
(daring,)

2403
01:29:49.604 --> 01:29:52.874
(and fierce)

2404
01:29:52.874 --> 01:29:56.778
(It's the best penalty.)

2405
01:29:57.478 --> 01:29:59.881
Ask them if anyone has fainted doing this.
