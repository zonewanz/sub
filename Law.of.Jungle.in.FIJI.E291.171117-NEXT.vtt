00:00:05.608 --> 00:00:08.278
In a moment, Byung Man's Tribe moves to the middle...

2
00:00:08.317 --> 00:00:10.547
of the Garden of the Spirits to start a new survival.

3
00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:13.317
It is filled with mysteries and abundance.

4
00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.857
What kind of presents will Byung Man's Tribe come across?

5
00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.727
And last week's hot topic was...

6
00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:20.058
the giant dolphinfish Tae Gon caught.

7
00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:21.797
They were also able to get some sauce.

8
00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:25.567
How will Tae Gon's raw dolphinfish taste?

9
00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:27.497
Let's get started.

10
00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:29.938
- My goodness, it's huge. - It's big.

11
00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:32.638
- It looks good. - My goodness.

12
00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:36.248
(How big is it exactly?)

13
00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:37.907
Didn't we say it was 1.2m?

14
00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:40.648
It got smaller.

15
00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:42.148
(They try to measure it.)

16
00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:43.347
What's the size?

17
00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:46.818
1m and 6.5cm.

18
00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:48.917
It's 1m and 6.5cm.

19
00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:49.928
That's amazing.

20
00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:52.657
- It's because we put it in ice. - It shrank.

21
00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:55.898
Can you give us a cutting board please?

22
00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:57.167
You cut it this way.

23
00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.328
I need to sit on one of those.

24
00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:01.068
You have to take the intestines out.

25
00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.237
(Tae Gon is the master of cutting raw fish.)

26
00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:04.807
You have to take it out?

27
00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:06.908
Once you cut it, it slides out.

28
00:01:08.637 --> 00:01:09.977
(Turning)

29
00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:11.447
(Turning with great force)

30
00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:13.717
- That looks so good. - It looks amazing.

31
00:01:13.747 --> 00:01:15.678
Goodness.

32
00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:17.318
He's removing the scales.

33
00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:20.158
(He's experienced.)

34
00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:24.258
He's so skilled. He's done it before.

35
00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:27.727
I thought about how to cut it.

36
00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:29.697
I decided to use my own style.

37
00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:31.497
Dolphinfish won't disappoint us.

38
00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:33.337
I was confident.

39
00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:34.837
(He learned to cut a fish,)

40
00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:36.508
(so he doesn't know how not to cut a fish.)

41
00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:38.738
(He removes the head...)

42
00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:40.437
(and the tail.)

43
00:01:40.477 --> 00:01:41.607
(He's so good.)

44
00:01:42.077 --> 00:01:43.747
It looks good.

45
00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:45.447
Really?

46
00:01:45.447 --> 00:01:47.118
(They're all amazed.)

47
00:01:47.118 --> 00:01:48.548
It's red.

48
00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.288
It's red.

49
00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:52.318
Look at the meat.

50
00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:54.658
This is amazing. We can eat the whole thing.

51
00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:55.818
(He reveals the pink-tinted meat.)

52
00:01:55.818 --> 00:01:57.458
I'm simply amazed.

53
00:01:57.727 --> 00:01:58.727
Look at that.

54
00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:01.527
It's huge.

55
00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:03.827
(He's like a master craftsman who makes every stitch by hand.)

56
00:02:03.827 --> 00:02:05.098
It looks so good.

57
00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:07.137
It was really challenging.

58
00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:11.067
The knife is supposed to slide through,

59
00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:13.108
but it got caught by the bone.

60
00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:15.937
It had large bones. They were tough.

61
00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:19.448
You're almost done. Hang in there, Tae Gon.

62
00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:22.448
How far am I?

63
00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:24.448
You're almost done. You're 80 percent there.

64
00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:26.958
You're almost done.

65
00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:29.428
(He finally cuts it in half.)

66
00:02:30.728 --> 00:02:31.888
That was fascinating to watch.

67
00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:33.328
(It's very meaty.)

68
00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.728
- The bones are this big. - My gosh.

69
00:02:36.728 --> 00:02:38.828
You'll die if this gets stuck in your throat.

70
00:02:38.828 --> 00:02:40.798
- It's like a carnivore. - Exactly.

71
00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:44.337
Hold on. While he's cutting up the fish,

72
00:02:44.368 --> 00:02:46.377
since we didn't catch anything,

73
00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:49.337
let's get something from the mountains.

74
00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:51.648
- We can look for cassavas. - That or some spices.

75
00:02:51.678 --> 00:02:53.618
- Fruits too. - Okay. Let's go.

76
00:02:53.648 --> 00:02:54.877
Fruits.

77
00:02:54.918 --> 00:02:56.187
Keep working on the fish.

78
00:02:56.187 --> 00:02:57.648
- All right. See you. - See you later.

79
00:02:57.648 --> 00:02:58.817
Please be careful.

80
00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:01.257
- It looks good. - Look at the intestines.

81
00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:02.858
- It looks a fish on its own. - It does.

82
00:03:02.858 --> 00:03:04.027
- It's a fish. - It is.

83
00:03:05.127 --> 00:03:06.798
- Let's see what it ate. - There's a fish in there.

84
00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:08.828
- There's a fish. - There is.

85
00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:10.898
- It ate a catfish. - It's pretty big.

86
00:03:12.298 --> 00:03:14.467
It's bigger than the one you guys caught earlier.

87
00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:16.268
- It's bigger than ours. - Yes, it is.

88
00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:18.238
It's bigger than the one you guys caught earlier.

89
00:03:18.268 --> 00:03:20.537
- It's bigger than ours. - It's bigger than ours.

90
00:03:20.537 --> 00:03:23.078
(Inside the dolphinfish's intestines,)

91
00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:24.807
(there are 4 small fish.)

92
00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:26.548
That's so fascinating.

93
00:03:26.548 --> 00:03:29.048
- Can't we eat these? - That's fascinating.

94
00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:31.847
(They're ashamed of themselves.)

95
00:03:32.347 --> 00:03:34.557
That's so fascinating.

96
00:03:34.757 --> 00:03:36.187
(Next step is to divide up into 4 parts.)

97
00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:37.728
We'll have more than enough.

98
00:03:37.728 --> 00:03:38.828
The color looks good.

99
00:03:38.828 --> 00:03:41.428
I'm curious. I really like seafood.

100
00:03:41.698 --> 00:03:44.428
- Are you cutting it in half? - I think I have to.

101
00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:46.567
- That looks amazing. - You have to skin it.

102
00:03:46.597 --> 00:03:48.537
(It's time to skin the fish.)

103
00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.868
It looks chewy.

104
00:03:51.837 --> 00:03:52.937
It looks really chewy.

105
00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:54.178
(He removes only the meat.)

106
00:03:55.537 --> 00:03:58.208
This is all you need to make food during Thanksgiving.

107
00:03:58.208 --> 00:03:59.277
I agree.

108
00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:00.948
It looks good.

109
00:04:01.018 --> 00:04:02.347
(This is even better than regular fried fillet.)

110
00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:04.148
I want to just chew on it.

111
00:04:06.118 --> 00:04:07.687
Cut it in half.

112
00:04:08.217 --> 00:04:10.557
I think I can rip it off.

113
00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:14.157
This is good. It's even tastier than using a knife.

114
00:04:14.928 --> 00:04:16.028
Press it down.

115
00:04:16.028 --> 00:04:17.228
(Hold on to it, Dam.)

116
00:04:19.368 --> 00:04:21.298
(The fish goes flying.)

117
00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:24.307
Why did you miss it?

118
00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:25.707
It slipped.

119
00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:27.338
(The fish went flying,)

120
00:04:27.338 --> 00:04:29.007
(and he looked devastated.)

121
00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:30.908
- We can wash it. - Give it back.

122
00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:33.048
We can pick it up fast.

123
00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:35.048
It slipped.

124
00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:36.147
He ripped it so hard. It flew so far.

125
00:04:36.147 --> 00:04:38.118
I didn't know you'd do it in one try.

126
00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:39.288
It flew away.

127
00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:43.358
- Do you see the white part? - Yes, is it fat?

128
00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:46.158
- This is... - It's in dried fish.

129
00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:48.457
really good for you.

130
00:04:48.528 --> 00:04:50.327
Once you use a knife, this goes away.

131
00:04:52.738 --> 00:04:54.598
My dad is really good at cutting raw fish.

132
00:04:56.368 --> 00:04:57.868
I miss my dad.

133
00:04:58.168 --> 00:04:59.437
- Your dad? - Yes.

134
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:02.278
That reminds me of my dad.

135
00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:05.678
I would watch my dad removing the intestines.

136
00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:09.517
My dad likes to fish too.

137
00:05:10.947 --> 00:05:13.317
If we're going to have raw fish, we need some seasoning.

138
00:05:13.317 --> 00:05:14.457
We can look for chili peppers.

139
00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:16.788
- That would be perfect. - Exactly.

140
00:05:18.428 --> 00:05:19.497
Hold on. Don't move.

141
00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:21.697
- It's a spider. - Do you see that?

142
00:05:21.697 --> 00:05:24.468
- I see it. - Be quiet.

143
00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:25.567
Right?

144
00:05:26.137 --> 00:05:28.668
- It's ripe. - It is ripe. It's yellow.

145
00:05:29.968 --> 00:05:31.637
Hey, wait.

146
00:05:32.877 --> 00:05:35.908
- Okay, you've got it. - It's ripe. It's soft.

147
00:05:36.207 --> 00:05:37.447
- Okay. - This is amazing.

148
00:05:37.447 --> 00:05:39.447
- Is there more? - There's one more.

149
00:05:39.447 --> 00:05:41.447
(One more?)

150
00:05:41.447 --> 00:05:42.447
How do we get that?

151
00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:46.517
Should I try climbing?

152
00:05:46.588 --> 00:05:48.588
- Can you go up? - I'm not sure.

153
00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:50.528
Why am I here today?

154
00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:53.798
I'm going to practice climbing a tree.

155
00:05:54.528 --> 00:05:57.327
This is my cousin's store.

156
00:05:57.428 --> 00:06:00.897
He has a big tree here so I came.

157
00:06:01.137 --> 00:06:02.168
It's really big.

158
00:06:02.168 --> 00:06:03.207
(Would Yun Hyeong be able to climb the tree?)

159
00:06:03.207 --> 00:06:04.207
Do you think I can do it?

160
00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:06.207
I'll do it like Chief Byung Man.

161
00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:08.538
(Climbing)

162
00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:12.747
(He takes big steps.)

163
00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:14.918
(He's quite good at climbing trees.)

164
00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:17.488
Isn't this good enough?

165
00:06:18.918 --> 00:06:21.757
- Come down. - Will I be able to do it there?

166
00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:22.757
You look like a monkey.

167
00:06:24.728 --> 00:06:25.957
Climb a little bit.

168
00:06:26.457 --> 00:06:28.827
Be careful.

169
00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:30.798
(Practicing helped.)

170
00:06:31.428 --> 00:06:33.368
Reach.

171
00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:35.137
Okay. You did it.

172
00:06:35.137 --> 00:06:36.538
(He did it.)

173
00:06:36.538 --> 00:06:37.567
(It's never too high for a jungle fan.)

174
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:39.738
I'm good at climbing trees.

175
00:06:39.738 --> 00:06:40.877
What can't you do?

176
00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:42.978
You're incredible.

177
00:06:43.848 --> 00:06:45.978
- They're all ripe. - They are.

178
00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:47.978
We've never had this before.

179
00:06:48.147 --> 00:06:50.147
- I've never seen it before. - Let's look for some more.

180
00:06:50.147 --> 00:06:52.757
Is there anything else? It's my first time seeing this.

181
00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:57.127
- There's a fruit. Hold on. - What is that?

182
00:06:57.127 --> 00:06:58.457
(Moon Sik has a good eye for his age.)

183
00:06:58.457 --> 00:06:59.757
What is that?

184
00:06:59.798 --> 00:07:01.697
It's kind of similar. Hold on.

185
00:07:03.197 --> 00:07:06.137
- Is this edible? - Yes, I think so.

186
00:07:06.598 --> 00:07:09.437
(He splits it in half.)

187
00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.637
- Wait. Is that a pumpkin? - It's edible.

188
00:07:11.637 --> 00:07:14.038
Is this a cucumber? I never thought we'd find a cucumber here.

189
00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:15.807
(Ivy gourds look and taste like cucumbers.)

190
00:07:15.807 --> 00:07:18.377
- It arouses my appetite right away. - Isn't this a cucumber?

191
00:07:20.017 --> 00:07:21.048
Try the end of it.

192
00:07:21.178 --> 00:07:24.187
(Moon Sik and Yun Hyeong try it like they're a father and a son.)

193
00:07:24.187 --> 00:07:25.517
- It's bitter. - This does taste like a cucumber.

194
00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:26.557
- I agree. - It does.

195
00:07:26.557 --> 00:07:28.988
(Yun Hyeong gives 10 stars for the experience of tasting ivy gourds.)

196
00:07:30.228 --> 00:07:31.288
There are four ivy gourds here.

197
00:07:31.387 --> 00:07:33.228
I wonder how this grows here.

198
00:07:33.257 --> 00:07:34.598
I'm sure no one planted seeds here.

199
00:07:34.598 --> 00:07:37.827
That's right. These are wild ivy gourds. They are really healthy.

200
00:07:38.298 --> 00:07:39.468
A cucumber? Really?

201
00:07:40.137 --> 00:07:41.767
These are wild vegetables,

202
00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:42.767
so they're small.

203
00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:46.007
We hit the jackpot. Where could we find these?

204
00:07:46.738 --> 00:07:48.278
- Wipe it. - Let's wipe it.

205
00:07:48.278 --> 00:07:49.807
- The sun hasn't risen yet? - What are those?

206
00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:51.207
- They are ripe, right? - These are papayas.

207
00:07:51.207 --> 00:07:52.408
- They look tasty. - That's awesome.

208
00:07:52.408 --> 00:07:53.548
- And look at these. - My gosh.

209
00:07:53.548 --> 00:07:54.647
- What are those? - These are like cucumbers.

210
00:07:54.647 --> 00:07:56.187
- They look like oranges. - These are wild cucumbers.

211
00:07:56.187 --> 00:07:57.247
- Really? They are cucumbers? - Yes.

212
00:07:58.118 --> 00:08:01.158
- Those will go nicely with sashimi. - We can have them with sashimi.

213
00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:02.658
Let me try this.

214
00:08:02.658 --> 00:08:05.757
- That just made a slicing sound. - It made a sound.

215
00:08:07.497 --> 00:08:08.757
(Crunchy)

216
00:08:08.757 --> 00:08:10.897
- That's it? - That means it's chewy.

217
00:08:10.897 --> 00:08:12.228
It's chewy.

218
00:08:12.497 --> 00:08:14.168
(Crunchy)

219
00:08:14.397 --> 00:08:15.798
- That must be so delicious. - This is incredible.

220
00:08:15.838 --> 00:08:17.108
(Slicing)

221
00:08:17.108 --> 00:08:18.408
It sounds like he's cutting radishes.

222
00:08:19.577 --> 00:08:21.507
- It does. - It does make a crunching sound.

223
00:08:21.507 --> 00:08:22.908
- It sounds different from slicing. - My gosh.

224
00:08:23.707 --> 00:08:25.207
- This part is the best. - That does look delicious.

225
00:08:25.247 --> 00:08:28.517
It does look good and might melt in my mouth.

226
00:08:28.548 --> 00:08:31.488
- That looks like pork belly meat. - She's right.

227
00:08:31.488 --> 00:08:32.757
It resembles pork belly meat.

228
00:08:32.757 --> 00:08:33.757
(The flesh cuts softly.)

229
00:08:33.757 --> 00:08:38.887
How would you rank this fish out of all the fish you caught so far?

230
00:08:38.887 --> 00:08:40.497
- This takes 1st place. - Really?

231
00:08:40.497 --> 00:08:41.558
(This takes 1st place.)

232
00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:44.828
When you see this episode, you'll see how excited he was.

233
00:08:44.868 --> 00:08:47.938
- I almost cried. - At the end, he was blown away.

234
00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:50.308
We were reeling it up and got close to catching it.

235
00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:53.308
He said that he finally got to catch a dolphinfish.

236
00:08:54.108 --> 00:08:55.578
- It's a dolphinfish. - My gosh.

237
00:08:55.608 --> 00:08:59.108
(I caught a dolphinfish at last.)

238
00:08:59.177 --> 00:09:02.177
(He blurted it out from the bottom of his heart as he was moved.)

239
00:09:03.147 --> 00:09:04.688
- That's what he said. - It sounds like it's from a drama.

240
00:09:04.688 --> 00:09:05.718
- He really said that. - It's a line from a drama.

241
00:09:05.718 --> 00:09:08.887
- You're laughing about it now. - You...

242
00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:11.287
I'm laughing now, but at that time, it wasn't funny.

243
00:09:11.287 --> 00:09:13.098
I was moved just as much.

244
00:09:13.098 --> 00:09:14.257
- Really? - Yes.

245
00:09:14.527 --> 00:09:15.997
That was Tae Gon at the sea.

246
00:09:16.027 --> 00:09:17.767
- There's so much food. - This is amazing.

247
00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:20.868
- He's decorating just like that. - There's a lot.

248
00:09:20.868 --> 00:09:22.738
- On top of sashimi? - On top of it?

249
00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:25.438
(What is his unique way of plating the sashimi?)

250
00:09:28.808 --> 00:09:31.708
(He places sashimi right on top of the fish he carved out.)

251
00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:35.417
- I've never had such thick sashimi. - Me neither.

252
00:09:35.848 --> 00:09:39.887
I always put sashimi on top of the fish bones.

253
00:09:39.887 --> 00:09:42.588
That's how people who are eating can learn from which part it's.

254
00:09:42.618 --> 00:09:44.188
(Tae Gon is certainly classy.)

255
00:09:44.228 --> 00:09:46.397
- These are very different. - I'll put them on the bottom.

256
00:09:46.627 --> 00:09:47.698
Isn't that the tastiest part?

257
00:09:48.228 --> 00:09:51.397
This part is tender, and this part tastes like sirloin.

258
00:09:51.397 --> 00:09:53.968
- Which one is the best part then? - This part a has nice texture.

259
00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:54.997
(He's like an owner of a sashimi restaurant.)

260
00:09:54.997 --> 00:09:57.238
- This is just unbelievable. - If we eat it like this...

261
00:09:57.238 --> 00:10:00.007
We'll be able to know which part of the fish we're eating.

262
00:10:00.037 --> 00:10:01.208
This would be so nice.

263
00:10:01.777 --> 00:10:03.907
I just realized there's so much food.

264
00:10:03.907 --> 00:10:05.277
Exactly, but that's only half a fish.

265
00:10:05.747 --> 00:10:07.218
That refreshing taste arouses your appetite.

266
00:10:07.218 --> 00:10:08.818
(He uses the ivy gourds to decorate.)

267
00:10:08.818 --> 00:10:12.017
Those are like garnishes we eat when we have sashimi.

268
00:10:12.047 --> 00:10:13.358
Just like that.

269
00:10:14.488 --> 00:10:15.618
That looks nice.

270
00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.828
The color contrast...

271
00:10:17.828 --> 00:10:20.598
of red and green...

272
00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:21.958
brings out the whole dish.

273
00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:24.797
- This is great. - All right.

274
00:10:24.828 --> 00:10:27.297
Let's give it up for Tae Gon.

275
00:10:27.598 --> 00:10:28.667
- Thank you. - You're so cool.

276
00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:30.637
- I bet you can sleep well at night. - This is awesome.

277
00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:32.568
(Let's give it up for Dam who was a great helper.)

278
00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:34.838
Tae Gon said he's going to use "dolphinfish" as his nickname.

279
00:10:34.838 --> 00:10:36.108
- dolphinfish? - He's serious.

280
00:10:36.108 --> 00:10:37.208
dolphinfish Tae Gon.

281
00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:38.777
Thank you.

282
00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:39.777
- What's next to chojang? - Thank you.

283
00:10:39.777 --> 00:10:41.547
- Is that wasabi? - No way. I can't believe it.

284
00:10:41.547 --> 00:10:43.547
- This is incredible. - Do we have wasabi too?

285
00:10:43.547 --> 00:10:45.417
- We have soy sauce with wasabi. - We have soy sauce with wasabi.

286
00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.627
- In my opinion, - I bet this is the tastiest.

287
00:10:49.657 --> 00:10:52.728
for a nice texture, try this.

288
00:10:52.757 --> 00:10:55.627
- Try this if you want tender meat. - The one over there.

289
00:10:55.627 --> 00:10:56.627
The belly part is the tastiest.

290
00:10:56.627 --> 00:10:58.328
(Welcome to "Friday Food Talk".)

291
00:10:58.328 --> 00:11:00.997
Dam and Tae Gon should have the first bite.

292
00:11:01.637 --> 00:11:02.667
You guys caught this.

293
00:11:03.238 --> 00:11:05.108
- Try the fish. - Okay.

294
00:11:05.108 --> 00:11:07.507
- I'll try it. - You should try it.

295
00:11:07.978 --> 00:11:09.208
- That's thick. - That's so thick.

296
00:11:09.777 --> 00:11:13.118
- It is thick. - Say how you feel before eating.

297
00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:16.088
I just can't believe it.

298
00:11:16.088 --> 00:11:17.218
- He can't believe it. - It's unbelievable.

299
00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:18.517
I'll try it now.

300
00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:21.358
(He eats a piece without any hesitation.)

301
00:11:21.358 --> 00:11:23.328
(Crunching)

302
00:11:24.828 --> 00:11:29.058
(How does it taste?)

303
00:11:30.968 --> 00:11:33.037
- How's the aftertaste? - I'm not saying this for the show.

304
00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.338
(I'm not saying this for the show.)

305
00:11:35.338 --> 00:11:36.507
It's so sweet.

306
00:11:36.507 --> 00:11:38.037
- It's sweet? - Really?

307
00:11:38.037 --> 00:11:39.108
I can't wait to find out.

308
00:11:39.108 --> 00:11:40.407
- Even without the sauce? - He says it's sweet.

309
00:11:40.407 --> 00:11:42.137
- It tastes sweet. - It's sweet without the sauce?

310
00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:44.208
- Yes. You should try it. - That's so interesting.

311
00:11:44.647 --> 00:11:46.318
This doesn't taste like tuna.

312
00:11:47.718 --> 00:11:50.088
This tastes somewhere between a sea bream and a tuna.

313
00:11:50.088 --> 00:11:51.488
There's this subtle taste in it.

314
00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:53.257
- Between a sea bream and a tuna? - I see.

315
00:11:53.257 --> 00:11:54.417
- Dam should try it. - Dam, have one.

316
00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:55.588
Let me try one from the belly.

317
00:11:55.588 --> 00:11:56.588
(Dam tastes one from the belly.)

318
00:11:56.588 --> 00:11:58.328
- This is the belly. - I'm curious.

319
00:12:00.157 --> 00:12:01.358
(Popping in)

320
00:12:01.358 --> 00:12:03.698
This will amaze you once you try it.

321
00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:07.198
This is...

322
00:12:08.198 --> 00:12:09.637
Is it tasty enough for you?

323
00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:11.338
- This part tastes savory. - It does?

324
00:12:11.368 --> 00:12:13.537
It's tasty and refreshing.

325
00:12:13.808 --> 00:12:16.948
- Your Majesty, I'll try the fish. - Yes.

326
00:12:16.948 --> 00:12:17.978
Go ahead.

327
00:12:17.978 --> 00:12:19.478
(Mook Sik tastes it 3rd.)

328
00:12:21.078 --> 00:12:22.118
(Will he like it?)

329
00:12:22.118 --> 00:12:23.547
He ate a big one.

330
00:12:25.218 --> 00:12:26.818
- Your Majesty, let me eat one more. - One more?

331
00:12:26.818 --> 00:12:30.088
- Can I? - Sure. Have another.

332
00:12:30.088 --> 00:12:33.027
(Let's start eating now!)

333
00:12:34.627 --> 00:12:35.958
I want one from the belly part.

334
00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:38.568
- I recommend this part. - The belly?

335
00:12:38.568 --> 00:12:39.637
- I need the sauce. - I'll just dip it in soy sauce.

336
00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:41.568
- My gosh. - I can't wait to taste this.

337
00:12:42.397 --> 00:12:43.868
(The youngest tries it first.)

338
00:12:43.868 --> 00:12:44.938
It fills up my whole mouth.

339
00:12:46.637 --> 00:12:48.238
(He's smiling proudly.)

340
00:12:48.238 --> 00:12:49.708
This is so sweet. It really is.

341
00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:51.007
- Really? - It tastes like honey.

342
00:12:51.277 --> 00:12:52.348
- Are you serious? - What kind of food is this?

343
00:12:52.348 --> 00:12:53.578
- Look how his face changed. - It's really sweet?

344
00:12:53.578 --> 00:12:54.578
- It's that good? - Yes.

345
00:12:54.578 --> 00:12:55.647
I'm not lying.

346
00:12:55.647 --> 00:12:57.118
- All right. - 1, 2, 3.

347
00:12:57.348 --> 00:13:00.318
(Everyone tastes it at the same time.)

348
00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:04.958
(Her eyes open wide.)

349
00:13:08.098 --> 00:13:09.667
I was going to slice it again after eating it.

350
00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:12.098
- How's the taste? - This is so good.

351
00:13:12.127 --> 00:13:14.497
(What does Jin Woon who loves sashimi think?)

352
00:13:14.537 --> 00:13:17.507
This has to be the best sashimi I had in my lifetime.

353
00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:20.338
- It's not easy to catch this. - You're hurting my pride.

354
00:13:20.377 --> 00:13:22.808
(He's not good at hunting, but his reactions are the best.)

355
00:13:22.808 --> 00:13:23.907
(Meanwhile, Bo Mi eats one too.)

356
00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:25.677
The best food I had...

357
00:13:26.318 --> 00:13:28.448
on this show was the eels.

358
00:13:28.747 --> 00:13:30.517
But now, this is the best.

359
00:13:30.618 --> 00:13:31.688
It's more than just being tasty.

360
00:13:31.718 --> 00:13:34.318
- This tastes divine. - What about you?

361
00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.027
I thought it was going to be really tough...

362
00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:39.458
- because of the sound earlier. - I agree.

363
00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:42.558
- It made a sound. - I thought I couldn't chew it,

364
00:13:42.558 --> 00:13:44.728
- but I had no problem chewing it. - It's tender, isn't it?

365
00:13:44.728 --> 00:13:45.728
No problem chewing it?

366
00:13:45.728 --> 00:13:48.738
I mean it. I could have chewed with my tongue.

367
00:13:48.838 --> 00:13:50.407
- What about you, Cho Rong? - Cho Rong.

368
00:13:50.738 --> 00:13:53.677
I'm not fond of sashimi,

369
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.377
- but it's not fishy. It's sweet. - It is, isn't it?

370
00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.308
I like sashimi, and the texture is amazing.

371
00:13:58.348 --> 00:14:00.017
- I agree. - We can make sushi with these.

372
00:14:00.017 --> 00:14:01.718
- The white part is the best. - Didn't I tell you?

373
00:14:01.747 --> 00:14:03.988
- That's where it was from. - You didn't use the knife for it.

374
00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:05.887
I pulled off the flesh.

375
00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:07.958
- It's really good. - This tastes amazing.

376
00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.088
That's why it's delicious.

377
00:14:09.088 --> 00:14:10.558
- Let's eat more. - Let's do that.

378
00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:11.927
- Let's eat. - We should eat it now.

379
00:14:11.927 --> 00:14:13.427
- Here we go. - Let's eat sashimi.

380
00:14:13.427 --> 00:14:15.598
Thank you for the food.

381
00:14:15.627 --> 00:14:17.797
- The belly part does taste savory. - I agree.

382
00:14:18.068 --> 00:14:19.897
- This is very savory. - It's aged well. So it's delicious.

383
00:14:21.238 --> 00:14:22.667
I don't eat more if something isn't good.

384
00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:26.137
- We're eating so much good food. - The coconut crab is third.

385
00:14:26.177 --> 00:14:28.308
I didn't imagine I'd be eating sashimi in the jungle.

386
00:14:28.308 --> 00:14:30.177
- It's so good. - This is unbelievable.

387
00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:32.007
- This is just so good. - This tastes amazing.

388
00:14:32.047 --> 00:14:34.547
Look at Cho Rong. She said she does not eat sashimi, but she's eating.

389
00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:36.218
(I'll eat the whole fish.)

390
00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:37.247
That means it's really delicious.

391
00:14:37.488 --> 00:14:38.517
- That's right. - On top of that...

392
00:14:39.688 --> 00:14:42.088
- My effort paid off in the end. - It's really good.

393
00:14:42.787 --> 00:14:44.458
This tastes like good beef.

394
00:14:44.458 --> 00:14:46.198
- We worked hard on the boat. - This is amazing.

395
00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:47.257
(The dolphinfishs are tastier than red sea breams.)

396
00:14:47.257 --> 00:14:48.558
This tastes like beef.

397
00:14:48.558 --> 00:14:51.728
(She's about to make an appearance right about now.)

398
00:14:52.698 --> 00:14:54.637
(This is time for Bo Mi, the eater.)

399
00:14:54.637 --> 00:14:57.608
There are too many delicious food to eat.

400
00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.007
(They're very happy to try dolphinfish.)

401
00:14:59.007 --> 00:15:00.808
- Try it with the cucumber slice. - With the cucumber slice?

402
00:15:00.808 --> 00:15:02.078
(Bo Mi can't stand still.)

403
00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:04.047
(It gets stuck between her teeth.)

404
00:15:05.047 --> 00:15:06.647
- This one is the tastiest. - Dip it in the wasabi.

405
00:15:06.647 --> 00:15:07.677
This is so good.

406
00:15:08.218 --> 00:15:10.917
- Where are you? - Come and try this.

407
00:15:10.948 --> 00:15:12.088
Can we get more wasabi, please?

408
00:15:12.088 --> 00:15:13.887
We're eating so much good food.

409
00:15:13.887 --> 00:15:14.887
This is so good.

410
00:15:14.887 --> 00:15:16.058
(She finishes eating with a refill of wasabi.)

411
00:15:17.787 --> 00:15:19.328
The cameraman who is in charge of filing me...

412
00:15:19.328 --> 00:15:21.497
- Sashimi from the back is all gone. - We're going to finish this.

413
00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:24.997
They continue eating. It must mean it's really tasty.

414
00:15:24.997 --> 00:15:26.738
It's not fishy at all.

415
00:15:27.767 --> 00:15:28.838
This tastes incredible.

416
00:15:28.868 --> 00:15:30.137
(According to BroBible Magazine,)

417
00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:31.438
(dolphinfishs are the 4th tastiest fish.)

418
00:15:31.438 --> 00:15:32.568
(Food in the Garden is delicious.)

419
00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:33.608
- Isn't it good? - It's good.

420
00:15:34.208 --> 00:15:36.308
- We have two pieces left. - We ate everything.

421
00:15:37.108 --> 00:15:39.848
- We finished eating sashimi. - We ate so quickly.

422
00:15:40.618 --> 00:15:43.818
- 1 hour to cook, 5 minutes to eat. - We finished so quickly.

423
00:15:44.147 --> 00:15:46.157
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

424
00:15:46.757 --> 00:15:48.757
What I was surprised about this special was that...

425
00:15:48.757 --> 00:15:50.858
- we ate a lot of good food. - I agree.

426
00:15:50.858 --> 00:15:53.358
- We ate the coconut crab. - We did.

427
00:15:53.358 --> 00:15:54.828
- We ate the shrimps. - Shrimps were tasty.

428
00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:56.127
- And we had this too. - Right.

429
00:15:56.127 --> 00:15:58.698
This time, these old guys did such a great job. They were tasty.

430
00:15:59.027 --> 00:16:00.637
- They were perfect. - Thank you, old guys.

431
00:16:00.637 --> 00:16:03.637
- What did you say? - You were seriously awesome.

432
00:16:03.637 --> 00:16:04.667
We are old guys?

433
00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:05.907
- Let's wrap up. - Okay.

434
00:16:05.938 --> 00:16:08.677
Let's finish with Tae Gon's cute act.

435
00:16:08.738 --> 00:16:09.848
I like that idea.

436
00:16:09.948 --> 00:16:13.078
I'm sorry, but I can't watch it. I can't possibly stand it.

437
00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:14.877
- Say, "Only I will eat the it." - I'm going to scold you.

438
00:16:14.877 --> 00:16:16.948
- Tae Gon doesn't want to do it. - Okay.

439
00:16:16.988 --> 00:16:18.247
"Only I will eat the dolphinfish."

440
00:16:19.287 --> 00:16:20.287
I can't wait for this.

441
00:16:20.287 --> 00:16:23.328
- Try it. - Can you do it for us?

442
00:16:23.757 --> 00:16:25.927
Trying it won't hurt. Everyone's in a good mood now.

443
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.228
(I, Lee Tae Gon,)

444
00:16:27.228 --> 00:16:31.027
(used to rule Goguryeo and take the role of King Gwanggaeto.)

445
00:16:32.698 --> 00:16:34.568
(A lot of things are going through his head.)

446
00:16:34.598 --> 00:16:35.797
Use the higher tone of your voice.

447
00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:37.108
When you say it, mispronounce it to sound cute.

448
00:16:37.108 --> 00:16:39.608
- Show him. 1, 2, 3. - Mispronounce it.

449
00:16:39.608 --> 00:16:41.208
Cho Rong is going to show us an example.

450
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:42.948
Only I will eat the dolphinfish.

451
00:16:44.507 --> 00:16:47.078
(He feels uneasy.)

452
00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:49.988
- It's your turn. One... - Wait.

453
00:16:50.088 --> 00:16:52.188
- Do the cute act. - It's the crisis of his lifetime.

454
00:16:52.188 --> 00:16:54.757
- I've never seen him do this. - I haven't either.

455
00:16:54.757 --> 00:16:55.818
This is his biggest crisis.

456
00:16:55.818 --> 00:16:58.188
Do I say, "Only I will eat the dolphinfish" like this?

457
00:16:58.228 --> 00:17:00.098
- Look at the camera and say it. - You can do it.

458
00:17:00.098 --> 00:17:01.897
- He can't look at the camera. - Do it while looking at the camera.

459
00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:04.028
- Do it just like that. - He can't look at the camera.

460
00:17:04.028 --> 00:17:05.127
You shouldn't cross your arms.

461
00:17:05.127 --> 00:17:07.368
I think he's done something like this before.

462
00:17:07.368 --> 00:17:08.937
He's done this a few times.

463
00:17:08.937 --> 00:17:10.308
(While everybody is not paying attention...)

464
00:17:10.308 --> 00:17:12.207
(I'm going to have the dolphinfish by myself.)

465
00:17:12.808 --> 00:17:15.308
I'm going to have the dolphinfish by myself.

466
00:17:15.308 --> 00:17:16.308
(This is the real man's first attempt at being cute.)

467
00:17:16.308 --> 00:17:18.548
(He tries to be...)

468
00:17:18.548 --> 00:17:20.048
(as cute as he can be.)

469
00:17:20.048 --> 00:17:22.018
He sounds American.

470
00:17:22.018 --> 00:17:23.387
Is he born in America?

471
00:17:23.387 --> 00:17:25.288
- "Dolphinfish..." - Was that it?

472
00:17:25.348 --> 00:17:26.818
He turned red.

473
00:17:28.387 --> 00:17:31.187
(He fished, cut up the raw fish, and showed his cuteness.)

474
00:17:31.227 --> 00:17:33.828
(He burned it up.)

475
00:17:33.858 --> 00:17:35.998
- Oh, dear. - That made us laugh.

476
00:17:35.998 --> 00:17:38.427
- Thank you. - Thank you for the meal.

477
00:17:38.427 --> 00:17:39.538
Tae Gon.

478
00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:44.437
Wait. It's not over yet.

479
00:17:44.538 --> 00:17:46.308
The remaining half of the dolphinfish...

480
00:17:46.308 --> 00:17:48.838
is for the staff members who worked as hard.

481
00:17:48.838 --> 00:17:51.548
Tae Gon cuts it up for them.

482
00:17:52.207 --> 00:17:53.677
Please line up.

483
00:17:55.477 --> 00:17:57.417
Open your mouth. Bigger.

484
00:17:57.447 --> 00:17:58.647
Open.

485
00:18:00.487 --> 00:18:01.818
Show us your cuteness.

486
00:18:02.258 --> 00:18:03.987
(I need to have the fish now.)

487
00:18:04.157 --> 00:18:06.627
Thanks to the gigantic dolphinfish,

488
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:09.157
Byung Man's Tribe had a feast.

489
00:18:09.157 --> 00:18:12.768
"The third night in the Garden of the Spirits comes to an end."

490
00:18:13.197 --> 00:18:17.038
(What will happen tomorrow?)

491
00:18:17.268 --> 00:18:20.578
Due to the bad weather, it was difficult surviving in the east.

492
00:18:20.578 --> 00:18:23.377
Today, they'll be going to the west side.

493
00:18:23.877 --> 00:18:27.717
This area is the most abundant within Taveuni Island.

494
00:18:27.717 --> 00:18:29.177
How will it look?

495
00:18:29.177 --> 00:18:30.717
- I see it. - We'll come back.

496
00:18:30.717 --> 00:18:31.748
I don't see anything.

497
00:18:31.748 --> 00:18:33.657
It's a big high but we can climb.

498
00:18:34.288 --> 00:18:35.457
There's more here.

499
00:18:35.457 --> 00:18:37.487
- Where? - Up there. On your right.

500
00:18:37.487 --> 00:18:39.288
- Should we take it? - It looks good.

501
00:18:39.288 --> 00:18:40.927
- Let's keep going first. - We have to keep going?

502
00:18:40.927 --> 00:18:43.197
- Let's go first. - There are tangerines too.

503
00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:45.028
There are tangerines.

504
00:18:45.068 --> 00:18:47.068
- Aren't those oranges? - They're oranges.

505
00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:48.868
Isn't this a good spot?

506
00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:50.608
That looks great. Let's build a shelter there.

507
00:18:50.608 --> 00:18:51.937
- Isn't this okay? - There?

508
00:18:51.937 --> 00:18:53.377
- There's shade too. - It's great.

509
00:18:53.377 --> 00:18:54.437
This is perfect.

510
00:18:54.437 --> 00:18:55.437
(It's flat and spacious with enough shade.)

511
00:18:55.437 --> 00:18:58.008
This is penthouse.

512
00:18:58.848 --> 00:19:00.748
There are going to be mosquitoes at night.

513
00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:03.217
It's going to be much better than the water though.

514
00:19:03.217 --> 00:19:05.647
- It's not as humid. - I agree.

515
00:19:05.647 --> 00:19:07.717
- Let's build a shelter here. - Let's do it here.

516
00:19:07.717 --> 00:19:10.427
- Let's put our bags down. - We've decided.

517
00:19:10.887 --> 00:19:12.127
Let's look for food now.

518
00:19:12.127 --> 00:19:13.397
- Let's go now. - We can get fruits.

519
00:19:13.397 --> 00:19:14.528
Let's get some fruits.

520
00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:17.667
- What's this? Isn't this a bone? - A bone?

521
00:19:18.427 --> 00:19:20.838
- It's a deer's bone. - It's a bone.

522
00:19:21.697 --> 00:19:23.008
(She's shocked.)

523
00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:24.268
- It's a deer's bone. - It's not.

524
00:19:25.108 --> 00:19:26.538
(Am I the only one not laughing?)

525
00:19:27.108 --> 00:19:28.377
It's a bone.

526
00:19:28.778 --> 00:19:31.108
It's a deer's leg bone.

527
00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:32.508
It's a bone... It's not.

528
00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:34.917
It obviously isn't.

529
00:19:35.518 --> 00:19:36.788
It's not a bone?

530
00:19:37.318 --> 00:19:40.288
(Tae Gon is already looking in the forest.)

531
00:19:40.288 --> 00:19:42.927
This is much better than there.

532
00:19:43.657 --> 00:19:45.387
(He unintentionally finds another good spot.)

533
00:19:46.258 --> 00:19:47.558
(Let me see.)

534
00:19:48.498 --> 00:19:50.098
(At that moment)

535
00:19:50.127 --> 00:19:52.528
(Cackling)

536
00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:53.897
Dam.

537
00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.068
Ryu Dam.

538
00:19:57.268 --> 00:19:58.707
(Dam is coming.)

539
00:20:00.437 --> 00:20:01.907
There's a chicken!

540
00:20:01.937 --> 00:20:03.278
(He wakes up the entire forest.)

541
00:20:03.278 --> 00:20:05.207
Isn't it far away?

542
00:20:05.207 --> 00:20:07.278
(Dolphinfish and coconut crab hunters are on their way.)

543
00:20:07.278 --> 00:20:09.818
- There are no stones. - There are none.

544
00:20:09.818 --> 00:20:11.248
This is too small.

545
00:20:11.248 --> 00:20:13.457
(I can use a coconut instead.)

546
00:20:13.457 --> 00:20:17.157
(They walk towards the sound.)

547
00:20:17.187 --> 00:20:18.657
(Pausing)

548
00:20:18.657 --> 00:20:19.798
It's there.

549
00:20:21.957 --> 00:20:23.627
It's there.

550
00:20:23.998 --> 00:20:26.737
(They find a wild chicken.)

551
00:20:27.498 --> 00:20:29.637
Go to the other side.

552
00:20:29.667 --> 00:20:31.967
- There are three. - There's no path.

553
00:20:34.207 --> 00:20:36.977
We have to corner them.

554
00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.377
(They have to corner it.)

555
00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:42.147
Hey. Guys!

556
00:20:42.248 --> 00:20:43.417
- Hey. - Hey.

557
00:20:43.987 --> 00:20:45.217
Kang Nam.

558
00:20:45.217 --> 00:20:47.018
(They can't hear.)

559
00:20:47.717 --> 00:20:50.927
(Tae Gon keeps on going.)

560
00:20:50.927 --> 00:20:52.727
- Tae Gon, Tae Gon. - Where?

561
00:20:52.727 --> 00:20:55.258
There. Here.

562
00:20:55.298 --> 00:20:56.868
Here.

563
00:20:56.868 --> 00:20:58.197
(They work together.)

564
00:20:58.227 --> 00:21:00.237
One person has to corner it.

565
00:21:00.268 --> 00:21:02.397
- Where is it? - It's there.

566
00:21:02.397 --> 00:21:03.467
There it is.

567
00:21:03.967 --> 00:21:06.808
- I'll corner it. - It went in.

568
00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:07.838
(They get antsy.)

569
00:21:07.838 --> 00:21:10.447
It's here. There are three. Come here.

570
00:21:10.977 --> 00:21:12.508
(The chickens hid inside the bushes.)

571
00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:14.318
We can't do anything if they hide.

572
00:21:14.848 --> 00:21:17.618
They went in. Go there, Dam.

573
00:21:17.618 --> 00:21:18.748
Make them come here.

574
00:21:19.387 --> 00:21:21.657
(Dam blocks their escape route.)

575
00:21:23.927 --> 00:21:25.657
(They're all prepared.)

576
00:21:28.998 --> 00:21:30.197
They're there, right?

577
00:21:30.598 --> 00:21:33.038
- Here? - Isn't there one?

578
00:21:33.937 --> 00:21:35.598
- They're not here. - One went that way.

579
00:21:35.598 --> 00:21:37.538
- It didn't come here. - I saw it go.

580
00:21:37.568 --> 00:21:38.667
(They've hidden their traces.)

581
00:21:38.667 --> 00:21:39.877
It's hard to approach them.

582
00:21:40.937 --> 00:21:42.947
Dam, they're here.

583
00:21:42.947 --> 00:21:44.177
- Where? - Over there.

584
00:21:44.177 --> 00:21:45.647
(Tae Gon spots them again.)

585
00:21:46.078 --> 00:21:47.078
Look at these guys.

586
00:21:47.078 --> 00:21:48.447
(They're not an easy target.)

587
00:21:48.447 --> 00:21:50.088
(Tae Gon and Dam are more determined now.)

588
00:21:50.088 --> 00:21:51.217
(At that moment)

589
00:21:51.217 --> 00:21:52.687
(Throwing)

590
00:21:53.987 --> 00:21:55.288
(Tae Gon threw the coconut.)

591
00:21:55.288 --> 00:21:56.528
You hit it.

592
00:21:56.588 --> 00:21:57.657
You hit...

593
00:21:57.657 --> 00:21:58.657
(They don't hesitate.)

594
00:21:58.657 --> 00:22:00.758
(They both run for it.)

595
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:02.157
You hit it.

596
00:22:02.598 --> 00:22:04.127
(He hits the target.)

597
00:22:05.798 --> 00:22:07.268
Where is it?

598
00:22:07.298 --> 00:22:08.667
Guys!

599
00:22:08.697 --> 00:22:10.137
- Hey! - Guys!

600
00:22:10.167 --> 00:22:12.237
- Guys, chicken! - Are they hunting?

601
00:22:13.038 --> 00:22:14.137
Oh my gosh.

602
00:22:14.437 --> 00:22:16.548
- You hit it! - This is unbelievable.

603
00:22:16.548 --> 00:22:18.248
- You hit it! - Hurry.

604
00:22:18.248 --> 00:22:19.447
Guys!

605
00:22:19.447 --> 00:22:20.818
Chicken!

606
00:22:21.177 --> 00:22:22.477
Corner it.

607
00:22:22.477 --> 00:22:23.917
(This is "Chicken Run".)

608
00:22:23.947 --> 00:22:25.947
(Dashing)

609
00:22:28.288 --> 00:22:30.088
(The young ones are here.)

610
00:22:30.127 --> 00:22:31.157
(It's a dead end.)

611
00:22:31.157 --> 00:22:33.457
- Where is it? - Go!

612
00:22:33.457 --> 00:22:34.627
(The veterans are here too.)

613
00:22:34.657 --> 00:22:35.657
(But he's slow.)

614
00:22:36.627 --> 00:22:37.798
Corner it.

615
00:22:37.798 --> 00:22:38.798
("Chicken Run")

616
00:22:38.798 --> 00:22:40.868
- Where is it? - There!

617
00:22:40.868 --> 00:22:42.568
- It's there, Kang Nam. - Where?

618
00:22:42.568 --> 00:22:44.137
I don't think it's a chicken.

619
00:22:46.008 --> 00:22:47.977
Bo Mi, it's a weapon.

620
00:22:47.977 --> 00:22:49.078
It's so fast.

621
00:22:49.278 --> 00:22:51.377
Isn't it too cruel to beat with that?

622
00:22:53.217 --> 00:22:54.778
I want to catch the chicken too.

623
00:22:55.778 --> 00:22:57.018
There are so many of them.

624
00:22:59.417 --> 00:23:01.518
- Where is it? - Right here!

625
00:23:01.518 --> 00:23:04.358
- Tae Gon, on your left! - Join me!

626
00:23:05.627 --> 00:23:07.657
(Dashing)

627
00:23:07.657 --> 00:23:09.127
(The chickens make them run everywhere.)

628
00:23:09.127 --> 00:23:10.298
It flew.

629
00:23:10.397 --> 00:23:12.197
- It flies. - Gosh, it flies.

630
00:23:12.197 --> 00:23:13.268
It flies.

631
00:23:13.368 --> 00:23:14.868
(That's cheating.)

632
00:23:15.568 --> 00:23:18.137
(It's not "Chicken Run" anymore. It's "Chicken Fly".)

633
00:23:19.207 --> 00:23:21.078
Maybe it's not a chicken. It's a bird.

634
00:23:21.137 --> 00:23:22.808
- It flies. - We can't catch birds.

635
00:23:23.048 --> 00:23:24.108
Where did it go?

636
00:23:24.677 --> 00:23:25.748
Where is it?

637
00:23:27.217 --> 00:23:29.118
(Even Tae Gon...)

638
00:23:29.118 --> 00:23:30.248
I'm so mad.

639
00:23:30.248 --> 00:23:31.288
(Even Tae Gon or Dam can't do it.)

640
00:23:31.387 --> 00:23:32.487
It's a bird.

641
00:23:33.058 --> 00:23:34.788
Chickens have to fly in order to survive.

642
00:23:35.588 --> 00:23:37.427
They're wild chickens.

643
00:23:37.427 --> 00:23:38.727
But still.

644
00:23:38.727 --> 00:23:40.627
- You hit it. - It got hit.

645
00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:42.328
(He found it first so he's the most disappointed.)

646
00:23:42.868 --> 00:23:45.028
- You should have told us first. - We did.

647
00:23:45.028 --> 00:23:46.667
We called for you several times.

648
00:23:46.667 --> 00:23:49.068
- Really? - We had to corner it.

649
00:23:49.068 --> 00:23:50.308
We kept on calling but nobody came.

650
00:23:50.308 --> 00:23:52.068
We can't catch it. It's too fast.

651
00:23:52.068 --> 00:23:53.338
We didn't corner it properly.

652
00:23:53.338 --> 00:23:54.407
(Trudging)

653
00:23:54.407 --> 00:23:56.048
We are supposed to encircle it.

654
00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:59.207
We kept on calling but nobody came.

655
00:23:59.207 --> 00:24:00.377
What's this, Cho Rong?

656
00:24:01.018 --> 00:24:03.118
What's this? Are you going to hit it?

657
00:24:03.118 --> 00:24:04.687
Are you kidding?

658
00:24:04.687 --> 00:24:07.018
- Let's get a slingshot. - This might be better.

659
00:24:07.018 --> 00:24:08.518
If it flies towards me, I'll hit it.

660
00:24:08.687 --> 00:24:09.758
If it flies towards me, I'll hit it.

661
00:24:09.758 --> 00:24:10.887
(She takes a full swing.)

662
00:24:11.058 --> 00:24:12.387
They were here.

663
00:24:12.387 --> 00:24:16.397
Let's brace up for a battle.

664
00:24:16.897 --> 00:24:17.927
We can make a plan.

665
00:24:17.927 --> 00:24:19.868
- You're sweating. - We can't waste our energy.

666
00:24:20.237 --> 00:24:21.697
(Tae Gon doesn't look so sharp anymore.)

667
00:24:21.697 --> 00:24:23.008
It got hit.

668
00:24:23.008 --> 00:24:24.008
- What do you mean? - I threw a stone.

669
00:24:24.008 --> 00:24:25.038
He threw a stone and it got hit.

670
00:24:25.038 --> 00:24:26.078
- The chicken got hit? - Yes.

671
00:24:26.078 --> 00:24:28.078
- Other chickens too? - There must be other birds too.

672
00:24:28.338 --> 00:24:31.578
We won't starve today.

673
00:24:31.808 --> 00:24:33.848
If we do a good job, we won't starve.

674
00:24:34.447 --> 00:24:35.548
Chickens fly here.

675
00:24:35.548 --> 00:24:37.447
- Exactly. - We can't catch it.

676
00:24:37.447 --> 00:24:40.157
There are so many of them though. It's possible.

677
00:24:40.157 --> 00:24:41.387
- Yun Hyeong. - Yes.

678
00:24:41.387 --> 00:24:42.828
- Get ready to make chicken. - Sure.

679
00:24:43.288 --> 00:24:44.687
I'll make boiled chicken.

680
00:24:44.687 --> 00:24:46.098
What should we do? Should we split?

681
00:24:46.098 --> 00:24:48.157
- There are fruits too. - Team Chicken.

682
00:24:48.157 --> 00:24:49.427
- You're going for chickens? - Yes.

683
00:24:49.427 --> 00:24:51.798
- I'll get some fruits. - Okay.

684
00:24:51.798 --> 00:24:53.568
- Rest will get fruits. - That's true.

685
00:24:53.598 --> 00:24:55.897
If you see chickens on the way, everybody help.

686
00:24:55.897 --> 00:24:57.407
Let us know.

687
00:24:57.967 --> 00:24:59.937
- They divide themselves up. - Let's go.

688
00:24:59.937 --> 00:25:03.808
Moon Sik's Hunting Team and Tae Gon's Fruit Team...

689
00:25:03.808 --> 00:25:06.417
start exploring the Garden of the Spirits.

690
00:25:07.147 --> 00:25:11.088
We have to look down and behind too. I'm so flustered.

691
00:25:11.088 --> 00:25:12.118
I agree.

692
00:25:12.987 --> 00:25:15.118
This area is kind of dark.

693
00:25:16.588 --> 00:25:19.457
We might find snakes.

694
00:25:19.457 --> 00:25:22.058
Let's make something to hit.

695
00:25:22.058 --> 00:25:25.167
What's this? I haven't seen this bug before.

696
00:25:25.727 --> 00:25:27.697
- What is this? - They're all here.

697
00:25:27.697 --> 00:25:28.737
My goodness.

698
00:25:29.068 --> 00:25:30.268
What's that?

699
00:25:31.407 --> 00:25:33.437
- What are these? - They're only here.

700
00:25:33.437 --> 00:25:36.377
(They're stuck to the branch.)

701
00:25:37.778 --> 00:25:40.677
- What are these? - We never see them in Seoul.

702
00:25:40.677 --> 00:25:43.687
(True bugs release secretions to as protection and extract plant sap.)

703
00:25:43.687 --> 00:25:46.558
- They look like stink bugs. - They won't move.

704
00:25:46.558 --> 00:25:47.558
There are more bugs.

705
00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:48.987
It's a spider.

706
00:25:49.187 --> 00:25:51.058
It caught something.

707
00:25:51.058 --> 00:25:52.657
- It caught something. - It did.

708
00:25:52.657 --> 00:25:54.758
- It's wrapping it. - That's incredible.

709
00:25:56.897 --> 00:25:58.467
(Hitting)

710
00:25:58.467 --> 00:26:00.467
(Hitting)

711
00:26:01.838 --> 00:26:03.768
- Do you feel something stinging? - I do.

712
00:26:03.768 --> 00:26:04.868
- Right? - Yes.

713
00:26:05.068 --> 00:26:06.508
There are so many mosquitoes.

714
00:26:06.677 --> 00:26:08.177
There are too many mosquitoes and bugs.

715
00:26:08.207 --> 00:26:10.907
I don't think there's a good area in the jungle.

716
00:26:10.907 --> 00:26:12.207
There are too many enemies.

717
00:26:12.508 --> 00:26:14.578
There are so many ants here.

718
00:26:15.118 --> 00:26:16.647
I don't like this.

719
00:26:18.187 --> 00:26:19.758
(She's startled.)

720
00:26:19.987 --> 00:26:21.058
What's wrong?

721
00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:24.358
(It's a toad and Cho Rong doesn't like it.)

722
00:26:24.358 --> 00:26:25.627
It's a frog.

723
00:26:27.798 --> 00:26:30.127
(It's so scary here.)

724
00:26:31.328 --> 00:26:33.667
It's a bat.

725
00:26:34.068 --> 00:26:36.667
- There are so many bats. - This is unbelievable.

726
00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:37.838
They are hanging like fruits.

727
00:26:37.838 --> 00:26:39.977
(This place is not ordinary.)

728
00:26:40.338 --> 00:26:41.937
- Really? - They're flying.

729
00:26:41.937 --> 00:26:43.008
- Where? - Oh my gosh!

730
00:26:43.008 --> 00:26:45.407
(They look spooky.)

731
00:26:45.508 --> 00:26:47.618
It looks like a scene from a horror film.

732
00:26:47.618 --> 00:26:50.088
Bats are found near scary houses.

733
00:26:50.288 --> 00:26:51.487
They're no joke.

734
00:26:51.487 --> 00:26:52.687
(Will they be able to find food here?)

735
00:26:52.687 --> 00:26:54.318
We have to look carefully.

736
00:26:54.318 --> 00:26:55.788
We might find something small.

737
00:26:57.657 --> 00:27:00.697
- It's a snake - It's a snake

738
00:27:00.697 --> 00:27:02.397
I've never had snakes before.

739
00:27:02.697 --> 00:27:04.897
- Snake wine. - I've had it once.

740
00:27:05.268 --> 00:27:06.838
Is snake wine really good?

741
00:27:06.868 --> 00:27:08.498
(Bright eyes)

742
00:27:09.737 --> 00:27:12.207
It'd be nice to have organic food researchers here.

743
00:27:12.338 --> 00:27:13.437
- I agree. - Yes.

744
00:27:14.137 --> 00:27:15.877
Don't you think most of these are edible?

745
00:27:17.348 --> 00:27:19.008
These look like beans.

746
00:27:19.248 --> 00:27:21.118
- I don't think those are edible. - Check this one.

747
00:27:21.548 --> 00:27:22.818
What are these?

748
00:27:23.518 --> 00:27:25.147
- They're beans. - They're right there.

749
00:27:25.147 --> 00:27:26.157
- What is that? - What are those?

750
00:27:26.217 --> 00:27:28.217
- They're like beans. - Can we eat them?

751
00:27:28.217 --> 00:27:29.258
They aren't beans.

752
00:27:29.627 --> 00:27:30.887
What are they?

753
00:27:31.358 --> 00:27:32.998
What are those?

754
00:27:32.998 --> 00:27:35.498
It'd be delicious if we cooked it.

755
00:27:35.498 --> 00:27:37.897
- It looks like fruit. - It'd be delicious if we cooked it.

756
00:27:37.897 --> 00:27:39.737
(I can taste it.)

757
00:27:39.737 --> 00:27:42.498
- Is it good? - It's really good.

758
00:27:42.737 --> 00:27:44.467
- What is it? - This...

759
00:27:44.608 --> 00:27:46.338
- Let's take them all. - Where is it?

760
00:27:46.377 --> 00:27:47.877
- Is it that good? - It's so good.

761
00:27:47.877 --> 00:27:49.447
- How do you eat it? - Try it.

762
00:27:49.447 --> 00:27:51.348
- This is... - It's like apple.

763
00:27:51.377 --> 00:27:53.518
- But it's not apple. - It's like starfruit.

764
00:27:53.977 --> 00:27:55.647
- It tastes like starfruit. - This is delicious.

765
00:27:55.877 --> 00:27:56.887
Let's take them all.

766
00:27:56.887 --> 00:27:59.487
It tastes like starfruit and apple.

767
00:27:59.687 --> 00:28:01.818
- It's sour. - Gosh, it's sour.

768
00:28:01.887 --> 00:28:02.957
Bilimbi.

769
00:28:02.957 --> 00:28:05.687
(Bilimbi fruits are rich in vitamins C, B, phosphorus, and iron.)

770
00:28:05.687 --> 00:28:07.127
You can tell as soon as you eat it.

771
00:28:07.127 --> 00:28:08.258
It's full of vitamin C.

772
00:28:08.258 --> 00:28:09.528
- You can tell right away. - Try it.

773
00:28:09.697 --> 00:28:11.697
Wait. Here's a big one.

774
00:28:11.927 --> 00:28:13.967
Let's take a whole bunch.

775
00:28:14.068 --> 00:28:15.697
- It woke me up. - Where's the bag?

776
00:28:15.697 --> 00:28:18.008
- Here. - They're like grapes.

777
00:28:18.008 --> 00:28:19.737
If this was in Korea...

778
00:28:20.177 --> 00:28:21.437
- Right, Cho Rong? - Yes.

779
00:28:21.437 --> 00:28:22.437
We could eat them.

780
00:28:22.608 --> 00:28:24.548
Let's have it for dessert.

781
00:28:24.548 --> 00:28:26.417
Gosh. Dessert.

782
00:28:28.147 --> 00:28:30.717
(Name: Bilimbi Characteristic: Sweet, sour, fresh)

783
00:28:30.717 --> 00:28:35.118
(I want to eat it at home! I'll have it all to myself.)

784
00:28:36.127 --> 00:28:37.427
- What's that up there? - Where?

785
00:28:38.528 --> 00:28:39.528
There.

786
00:28:40.828 --> 00:28:42.328
- Where? - Over there.

787
00:28:42.528 --> 00:28:44.528
- It's cacao. - Awesome.

788
00:28:44.528 --> 00:28:46.197
It's cacao. We have to pick the yellow one.

789
00:28:46.598 --> 00:28:48.338
- The yellow one? - It's chocolate.

790
00:28:48.338 --> 00:28:50.868
(Chocolate?)

791
00:28:51.808 --> 00:28:53.207
Bo Mi, chocolate.

792
00:28:54.937 --> 00:28:56.907
- Bo Mi, chocolate! - Bo Mi, side kick.

793
00:28:56.907 --> 00:28:59.548
Bo Mi, chocolate.

794
00:28:59.548 --> 00:29:02.248
Chocolate!

795
00:29:03.717 --> 00:29:05.088
(A perfect blow)

796
00:29:06.687 --> 00:29:09.217
That was a great kick. Something keeps falling.

797
00:29:09.217 --> 00:29:10.828
Something fell.

798
00:29:10.957 --> 00:29:11.957
(Kicking)

799
00:29:12.328 --> 00:29:13.657
- I think it might fall. - Really?

800
00:29:14.028 --> 00:29:15.058
- For real? - Yes.

801
00:29:15.427 --> 00:29:17.197
- It might fall. - The small one.

802
00:29:17.197 --> 00:29:18.427
I'm serious. One fell.

803
00:29:20.437 --> 00:29:22.338
- She's good. - She's really good.

804
00:29:22.338 --> 00:29:23.368
She's good.

805
00:29:23.368 --> 00:29:25.237
(Scared)

806
00:29:26.608 --> 00:29:30.108
(Chocolate has stimulated Bo Mi.)

807
00:29:30.748 --> 00:29:31.748
All the rotten ones fell.

808
00:29:31.748 --> 00:29:34.548
I'm afraid the tree will break.

809
00:29:36.147 --> 00:29:37.348
(Bo Mi jumps.)

810
00:29:38.548 --> 00:29:40.818
(She can't reach it.)

811
00:29:40.818 --> 00:29:43.727
Watch your head.

812
00:29:43.727 --> 00:29:45.528
(I'm tired.)

813
00:29:46.098 --> 00:29:47.227
That won't work.

814
00:29:47.227 --> 00:29:49.828
- Can you climb? - Put her on your shoulder.

815
00:29:49.828 --> 00:29:51.467
I don't think he can.

816
00:29:51.727 --> 00:29:53.598
Just try first.

817
00:29:53.598 --> 00:29:55.237
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

818
00:29:55.237 --> 00:29:56.568
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

819
00:29:56.637 --> 00:29:58.137
- Move up a little. - 1, 2, 3.

820
00:29:58.137 --> 00:30:00.838
- I'm sorry! - 2, 3.

821
00:30:00.838 --> 00:30:02.608
(She has the rock spirit.)

822
00:30:02.707 --> 00:30:04.877
- Keep your back straight. - Goodness.

823
00:30:04.877 --> 00:30:07.147
- Don't move. - Give her the stick.

824
00:30:07.147 --> 00:30:10.548
Here. She screams, but she doesn't back out.

825
00:30:10.548 --> 00:30:13.058
- You can do it. - That's it. Hit it.

826
00:30:13.518 --> 00:30:15.417
- Gosh. - Use both hands.

827
00:30:15.858 --> 00:30:17.487
Jin Woon. go closer.

828
00:30:17.528 --> 00:30:18.528
Use both hands.

829
00:30:18.528 --> 00:30:19.927
(Cacao, come here.)

830
00:30:19.927 --> 00:30:20.957
She'll get it.

831
00:30:21.727 --> 00:30:22.727
Good.

832
00:30:23.768 --> 00:30:25.098
(Shouting)

833
00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:28.967
(She shouts loudly.)

834
00:30:32.068 --> 00:30:33.508
(She aims again.)

835
00:30:33.508 --> 00:30:34.538
- Good. - That's good.

836
00:30:35.637 --> 00:30:38.608
(Smashing with a stick in full power)

837
00:30:39.348 --> 00:30:40.717
(I'll have to help her.)

838
00:30:42.618 --> 00:30:43.618
A little more.

839
00:30:43.618 --> 00:30:45.447
- I think it'll work. - I think so.

840
00:30:45.447 --> 00:30:47.118
- All right. - One at a time.

841
00:30:47.118 --> 00:30:49.487
- One person at a time. - 1, 2, 3.

842
00:30:50.088 --> 00:30:52.187
- Okay. 1, 2. - 3.

843
00:30:52.358 --> 00:30:53.498
1, 2, 3.

844
00:30:53.498 --> 00:30:55.127
(A collaboration of taekwondo and hapkido)

845
00:30:55.127 --> 00:30:57.397
- 1, 2, 1, 2. - 3.

846
00:30:58.368 --> 00:30:59.368
1, 2.

847
00:31:01.967 --> 00:31:03.237
(Sighing)

848
00:31:03.237 --> 00:31:04.467
We're close.

849
00:31:04.608 --> 00:31:06.008
Let's do this until we get it.

850
00:31:06.008 --> 00:31:07.237
(Jin Woon is getting tired.)

851
00:31:07.237 --> 00:31:09.707
- Is this delicious? - Yes, it's really good.

852
00:31:09.707 --> 00:31:10.707
Jin Woon, I'm sorry.

853
00:31:10.707 --> 00:31:12.348
No, Bo Mi. You're really light.

854
00:31:13.818 --> 00:31:15.447
- You almost got it. - Are you Cho Rong?

855
00:31:15.447 --> 00:31:17.487
Hit it. You just need to catch it.

856
00:31:18.447 --> 00:31:21.957
- Gosh. - Goodness.

857
00:31:21.957 --> 00:31:24.487
(Only the shell came off. The fruit remains on the tree.)

858
00:31:24.758 --> 00:31:25.927
The fruit is still there.

859
00:31:25.927 --> 00:31:28.657
That's what we should eat.

860
00:31:29.498 --> 00:31:31.227
What are we doing?

861
00:31:31.268 --> 00:31:33.637
It's weird how only that part didn't fall.

862
00:31:34.498 --> 00:31:37.068
- Catch it. - We have to eat that.

863
00:31:37.538 --> 00:31:40.937
We can eat it just as is. That's like candy.

864
00:31:41.207 --> 00:31:43.477
- She's got a bit angry. - She's mad.

865
00:31:44.108 --> 00:31:45.207
She grinned wickedly.

866
00:31:45.278 --> 00:31:47.917
She got it. Get the whole thing.

867
00:31:48.118 --> 00:31:51.018
- No. - Catch the whole thing.

868
00:31:51.018 --> 00:31:53.157
(Cacao beans flew everywhere.)

869
00:31:53.318 --> 00:31:54.858
- I got one. - Be careful.

870
00:31:54.858 --> 00:31:56.157
- Here. - I got one.

871
00:31:56.157 --> 00:31:57.828
- Let's try one each. - I'm sorry.

872
00:31:57.828 --> 00:31:59.227
- It's a seed. - How do we eat it?

873
00:31:59.227 --> 00:32:00.627
- You suck it. - Good job.

874
00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:03.727
- Just suck the white part. - Good job.

875
00:32:03.727 --> 00:32:06.338
(Apink did their best to eat chocolate.)

876
00:32:06.338 --> 00:32:07.338
Isn't it good?

877
00:32:07.437 --> 00:32:08.538
It's good, but...

878
00:32:10.967 --> 00:32:12.568
- The taste isn't what I thought. - Right?

879
00:32:12.637 --> 00:32:13.637
But it's delicious.

880
00:32:13.637 --> 00:32:15.137
- But it's good. - It's delicious.

881
00:32:15.137 --> 00:32:17.608
So they make chocolate...

882
00:32:17.608 --> 00:32:19.548
- with what's inside. - Chocolate.

883
00:32:19.548 --> 00:32:21.647
- They dry it. - It's good.

884
00:32:21.647 --> 00:32:24.548
(Bo Mi uses her taste sensors.)

885
00:32:24.548 --> 00:32:26.187
(Tasting)

886
00:32:27.088 --> 00:32:29.018
All the fruits taste the same here.

887
00:32:29.118 --> 00:32:30.727
(Sniffling)

888
00:32:30.727 --> 00:32:33.098
(I guess it's not chocolate.)

889
00:32:34.957 --> 00:32:35.957
Let's go.

890
00:32:36.068 --> 00:32:38.427
- We'll get more if there's more. - It's nice to suck on it.

891
00:32:38.427 --> 00:32:40.498
- It's like a candy. - Yes.

892
00:32:40.637 --> 00:32:43.538
(Name: Cacao Characteristic: Subtle sweet flavor)

893
00:32:43.538 --> 00:32:47.237
(Give me chocolate. I'll have it all to myself.)

894
00:32:49.108 --> 00:32:51.108
What's that up there?

895
00:32:51.947 --> 00:32:53.618
- I think it's orange. - Where?

896
00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:55.078
- Orange. - Shall we pick it?

897
00:32:55.078 --> 00:32:56.118
- We should. - Where?

898
00:32:56.417 --> 00:32:58.548
(Jin Woon climbs up the tree.)

899
00:32:58.548 --> 00:32:59.788
- Be careful. - All right.

900
00:33:00.318 --> 00:33:02.157
- He's like Tarzan. - Good.

901
00:33:02.487 --> 00:33:03.828
- It's orange. - Gosh.

902
00:33:03.828 --> 00:33:04.887
- Amazing. - Peel it.

903
00:33:04.887 --> 00:33:06.028
- Let's peel it. - Peel it.

904
00:33:06.127 --> 00:33:08.927
This isn't orange. It isn't tangerine either.

905
00:33:08.927 --> 00:33:10.127
It's nice. Hold it.

906
00:33:10.127 --> 00:33:12.328
- Is it ripe? - Gosh.

907
00:33:12.328 --> 00:33:14.937
- Nice. - It's kind of like grapefruit.

908
00:33:15.538 --> 00:33:18.038
I don't think it'll be sour.

909
00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:19.268
I think it'll be tangy.

910
00:33:19.637 --> 00:33:21.038
Won't it be sweet and sour?

911
00:33:22.177 --> 00:33:24.447
- It looks delicious. - Let's try it.

912
00:33:25.108 --> 00:33:26.518
(It's time to try it.)

913
00:33:28.018 --> 00:33:29.518
- It's like grapefruit. - This is great.

914
00:33:29.518 --> 00:33:30.548
(Fresh)

915
00:33:30.548 --> 00:33:32.187
- It's like grapefruit. - It's delicious.

916
00:33:32.187 --> 00:33:34.588
I'm eating stuff that I haven't been eating.

917
00:33:34.588 --> 00:33:36.528
You like anything from this island.

918
00:33:36.528 --> 00:33:37.858
- Dolphinfish. - Mandarin.

919
00:33:38.627 --> 00:33:40.627
"I can't believe I ate mandarin."

920
00:33:41.457 --> 00:33:42.868
(Still, dolphinfish is the best.)

921
00:33:44.068 --> 00:33:45.627
- It's bracken. - What?

922
00:33:45.868 --> 00:33:46.868
- Bracken. - Gosh.

923
00:33:46.868 --> 00:33:48.038
(They found bracken, the prince of forest.)

924
00:33:48.038 --> 00:33:49.368
- Why is it so thick? - Who likes bracken?

925
00:33:49.368 --> 00:33:51.108
- Me. - Do you like bracken?

926
00:33:51.108 --> 00:33:52.137
Yes.

927
00:33:52.637 --> 00:33:53.977
Is this how it normally looks like?

928
00:33:54.707 --> 00:33:56.477
We have a side dish now.

929
00:33:57.608 --> 00:33:58.608
Pull it out.

930
00:33:59.618 --> 00:34:01.278
- Amazing. - Ginger.

931
00:34:02.048 --> 00:34:03.748
- Ginger? - It smells like ginger.

932
00:34:03.748 --> 00:34:06.058
(They collect ginger.)

933
00:34:06.058 --> 00:34:07.088
- It does. - A little bit.

934
00:34:07.088 --> 00:34:08.157
- Just a bit. - Yes.

935
00:34:08.518 --> 00:34:10.058
- It's pepper. - You scared me.

936
00:34:10.058 --> 00:34:11.828
Isn't it pepper? It's pepper.

937
00:34:12.087 --> 00:34:13.527
- Look. - It's pepper.

938
00:34:13.527 --> 00:34:16.628
- That's nice. - Awesome.

939
00:34:16.697 --> 00:34:18.628
- There are more peppers. - There's more.

940
00:34:18.697 --> 00:34:20.797
- There are peppers everywhere. - This one is red.

941
00:34:20.797 --> 00:34:22.598
- Look at the color. - Isn't this spicy?

942
00:34:22.598 --> 00:34:24.868
Isn't it the really spicy one?

943
00:34:24.967 --> 00:34:26.078
This is great. Only take what we can eat.

944
00:34:26.078 --> 00:34:27.878
- This is enough peppers. - Yes.

945
00:34:28.237 --> 00:34:29.748
The flowers are so cute.

946
00:34:29.947 --> 00:34:32.007
- They're cute. - They're really cute.

947
00:34:32.007 --> 00:34:33.378
I want to grow them in my garden.

948
00:34:33.378 --> 00:34:35.748
- Me too. - Why are they so adorable?

949
00:34:35.748 --> 00:34:36.817
- They're so cute. - They're adorable.

950
00:34:36.817 --> 00:34:39.688
This is a jungle, but there are flowers.

951
00:34:39.688 --> 00:34:41.458
- There are butterflies. - The flowers are so cute.

952
00:34:41.458 --> 00:34:43.128
- Every jungle is different. - It's like a picture.

953
00:34:43.128 --> 00:34:44.128
It's morning glory.

954
00:34:44.128 --> 00:34:45.527
(The beautiful color of nature)

955
00:34:45.527 --> 00:34:46.527
It's so pretty.

956
00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:50.728
(Apink is...)

957
00:34:50.728 --> 00:34:51.868
(a girly girl.)

958
00:34:51.868 --> 00:34:53.797
- Gosh. - Let's have a look.

959
00:34:54.998 --> 00:34:56.737
It looks good on you.

960
00:34:56.737 --> 00:34:59.038
Please don't spin around with it on your head.

961
00:34:59.038 --> 00:35:00.078
Don't spin.

962
00:35:00.078 --> 00:35:02.038
- Don't spin. Just walk straight. - Okay.

963
00:35:02.038 --> 00:35:04.248
It's going to start raining soon.

964
00:35:04.748 --> 00:35:07.248
(She starts twirling naturally.)

965
00:35:09.047 --> 00:35:12.047
(Spinning innocently)

966
00:35:13.918 --> 00:35:16.628
(Just let us twirl.)

967
00:35:16.628 --> 00:35:18.228
(Straight face)

968
00:35:19.458 --> 00:35:21.998
(Smiling with a flower in her head)

969
00:35:23.228 --> 00:35:25.868
(They sure are having fun.)

970
00:35:27.998 --> 00:35:30.438
You two know how to have fun.

971
00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:32.268
(Every day is sunny in the jungle with Apink.)

972
00:35:34.378 --> 00:35:37.848
This is like natural soap to the natives here.

973
00:35:37.848 --> 00:35:39.148
- Which one? - Is it this one?

974
00:35:39.148 --> 00:35:40.618
- This? - Which one?

975
00:35:40.618 --> 00:35:43.317
Rub it and smell it.

976
00:35:43.447 --> 00:35:46.657
If you rub it in the water, it'll make soap bubbles.

977
00:35:46.657 --> 00:35:47.987
It makes bubbles?

978
00:35:48.987 --> 00:35:50.688
- It's so interesting. - Really.

979
00:35:51.328 --> 00:35:52.728
What's that smell?

980
00:35:53.058 --> 00:35:55.257
- It smells a bit. - Yes.

981
00:35:55.828 --> 00:35:57.967
I'll use this to wash my feet later.

982
00:35:58.228 --> 00:35:59.228
Okay.

983
00:35:59.228 --> 00:36:00.967
- It has a scent. - It smells a little bit.

984
00:36:00.967 --> 00:36:01.998
It has a scent.

985
00:36:03.837 --> 00:36:05.538
- This is so cool. - Yes.

986
00:36:05.708 --> 00:36:07.177
It smells like something.

987
00:36:07.507 --> 00:36:08.677
Will the scent be stronger if I rub it?

988
00:36:09.107 --> 00:36:10.148
It will.

989
00:36:10.748 --> 00:36:12.748
It's like a paper soap.

990
00:36:12.748 --> 00:36:13.777
- Is it? - Yes.

991
00:36:14.748 --> 00:36:15.748
Rub it.

992
00:36:17.047 --> 00:36:18.248
Rub it?

993
00:36:18.418 --> 00:36:20.487
(Moving his hands quickly)

994
00:36:20.958 --> 00:36:22.987
- Why? - It smells like lemon.

995
00:36:23.387 --> 00:36:25.058
- It smells great. - It smells like lemon.

996
00:36:25.058 --> 00:36:26.697
(Goodness! We need to take this home!)

997
00:36:26.697 --> 00:36:28.257
Wait.

998
00:36:28.257 --> 00:36:30.797
- Let's take it with us. - Gosh.

999
00:36:30.797 --> 00:36:31.868
Shall we take some?

1000
00:36:32.628 --> 00:36:33.737
This is great.

1001
00:36:33.737 --> 00:36:35.337
This will be enough.

1002
00:36:37.137 --> 00:36:38.538
(Lovely Tae Gon's Taste Part 2)

1003
00:36:38.538 --> 00:36:40.237
There are a lot of interesting things.

1004
00:36:41.277 --> 00:36:42.277
What's that?

1005
00:36:42.277 --> 00:36:44.677
There are taros and yams.

1006
00:36:44.677 --> 00:36:46.217
- Is this yam? - Yes.

1007
00:36:46.217 --> 00:36:48.717
- Awesome. - Underneath are all yams.

1008
00:36:48.717 --> 00:36:49.887
(Yams are buried underground.)

1009
00:36:49.887 --> 00:36:51.717
The roots are huge.

1010
00:36:51.717 --> 00:36:52.717
They're really big.

1011
00:36:53.157 --> 00:36:54.918
We can probably come back later.

1012
00:36:56.427 --> 00:36:59.228
- Dam, don't leave me. - I'll stay.

1013
00:36:59.697 --> 00:37:01.427
It took two hours for Chan Yeol to dig them out.

1014
00:37:01.728 --> 00:37:02.728
Really?

1015
00:37:02.768 --> 00:37:04.027
- Let's go. We'll be back. - Okay.

1016
00:37:04.197 --> 00:37:06.398
- It won't take long. - We will be back.

1017
00:37:06.438 --> 00:37:09.438
- Where are you going? - We won't go far.

1018
00:37:10.837 --> 00:37:11.907
(The staff leaves too.)

1019
00:37:11.907 --> 00:37:12.978
Don't go.

1020
00:37:13.407 --> 00:37:15.407
(We will set up a camera.)

1021
00:37:16.907 --> 00:37:19.447
(He is left alone.)

1022
00:37:20.748 --> 00:37:23.618
(He puts the camera on the ground...)

1023
00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:27.717
(and begins to dig up yam.)

1024
00:37:27.717 --> 00:37:31.288
(The lonely sound of an ax echoes in the jungle.)

1025
00:37:31.288 --> 00:37:35.458
(How is the Hunting Team doing?)

1026
00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:40.868
We should steer the chicken towards this spot.

1027
00:37:41.438 --> 00:37:43.837
- We can't do it in an open space. - We should go into the forest.

1028
00:37:43.837 --> 00:37:46.478
Inside the forest, we can corner it.

1029
00:37:46.478 --> 00:37:47.878
Since it can fly,

1030
00:37:47.878 --> 00:37:50.507
we need to block its movements.

1031
00:37:50.507 --> 00:37:52.777
Let's block its movements and attack.

1032
00:37:53.578 --> 00:37:55.148
I was reminded of East Timor.

1033
00:37:55.547 --> 00:37:58.288
"This is my opportunity."

1034
00:37:58.717 --> 00:38:01.558
"I will be able to catch a chicken and provide food."

1035
00:38:02.387 --> 00:38:07.498
(In East Timor, he succeeded in catching a chicken.)

1036
00:38:08.328 --> 00:38:09.768
I caught it. I caught it!

1037
00:38:09.768 --> 00:38:12.098
(His body remembers the experience.)

1038
00:38:12.797 --> 00:38:13.837
I caught it.

1039
00:38:14.297 --> 00:38:15.967
- Will you hit the chicken with it? - I will throw it at the chicken.

1040
00:38:15.967 --> 00:38:17.067
(There is another man who is confident.)

1041
00:38:17.067 --> 00:38:18.137
It will come in handy.

1042
00:38:18.538 --> 00:38:20.708
I want to catch it.

1043
00:38:21.337 --> 00:38:23.177
(The hunting instinct burns within him.)

1044
00:38:23.177 --> 00:38:26.447
It's the most exciting aspect...

1045
00:38:26.777 --> 00:38:27.878
of being in the jungle.

1046
00:38:28.447 --> 00:38:31.118
(He never grows tired.)

1047
00:38:31.118 --> 00:38:34.717
(On the land, he has caught a rabbit.)

1048
00:38:34.717 --> 00:38:38.257
(He has shown his strength in the water too.)

1049
00:38:38.257 --> 00:38:42.098
(By the river, he has caught a duck.)

1050
00:38:42.098 --> 00:38:44.598
(There is more.)

1051
00:38:44.598 --> 00:38:48.467
(At the sea, he has caught big fish.)

1052
00:38:48.467 --> 00:38:50.538
(He is a hunter no matter the time and location.)

1053
00:38:51.938 --> 00:38:53.478
(I am the expert on chickens.)

1054
00:38:53.478 --> 00:38:54.808
(The master of chicken hunting, Lee Moon Sik)

1055
00:38:55.777 --> 00:38:57.478
(It's time to add chicken to my list of catches.)

1056
00:38:57.478 --> 00:38:59.208
(The versatile hunter, Kang Nam)

1057
00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:02.447
Get harpoons and equipment that can be used to catch a chicken.

1058
00:39:03.987 --> 00:39:06.357
- Let's walk around. - Let's scout the area.

1059
00:39:07.688 --> 00:39:10.087
When you see a chicken, don't approach it.

1060
00:39:10.387 --> 00:39:12.328
We need to circle it.

1061
00:39:12.328 --> 00:39:13.898
- If you approach it, it will run. - The three of us...

1062
00:39:13.898 --> 00:39:15.427
need to put the chicken in the middle.

1063
00:39:16.228 --> 00:39:19.668
(The search starts.)

1064
00:39:19.668 --> 00:39:21.268
(At that moment)

1065
00:39:22.438 --> 00:39:24.007
- Do you hear that? - I hear baby birds.

1066
00:39:24.007 --> 00:39:25.407
(I hear baby birds.)

1067
00:39:25.507 --> 00:39:26.538
Let's go this way.

1068
00:39:27.107 --> 00:39:30.107
(They hurriedly move towards the sound.)

1069
00:39:30.107 --> 00:39:31.547
- There it is. - Is there a chicken?

1070
00:39:31.547 --> 00:39:33.118
There it is. Chase it.

1071
00:39:33.118 --> 00:39:34.748
(Did Kang Nam find a chicken?)

1072
00:39:34.748 --> 00:39:37.688
There are chicks too.

1073
00:39:38.648 --> 00:39:40.188
- I will go this way. - Over there.

1074
00:39:40.357 --> 00:39:42.087
(It's a chicken.)

1075
00:39:42.418 --> 00:39:43.458
Go that way.

1076
00:39:44.828 --> 00:39:48.197
(They begin to close in on the chicken.)

1077
00:39:48.197 --> 00:39:50.297
(The chicken is within their reach.)

1078
00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:53.038
(Shall I go and catch it now?)

1079
00:39:53.038 --> 00:39:54.797
(Slipping)

1080
00:39:54.797 --> 00:39:58.637
(The chicken flies away upon hearing Moon Sik's yelp.)

1081
00:39:58.637 --> 00:40:00.708
(Wait right there.)

1082
00:40:00.708 --> 00:40:03.907
The chicken flew! We can't go this way. It's a cliff.

1083
00:40:05.308 --> 00:40:07.118
- Where did it go? - It flew away.

1084
00:40:07.648 --> 00:40:09.277
We can't go this way.

1085
00:40:11.688 --> 00:40:14.188
It's a cliff.

1086
00:40:14.188 --> 00:40:15.188
(Moon Sik runs over belatedly.)

1087
00:40:15.188 --> 00:40:17.657
(I am sorry.)

1088
00:40:18.257 --> 00:40:20.257
We should run after the chicken until the end.

1089
00:40:21.157 --> 00:40:24.197
- We should circle it. - No, let's just run.

1090
00:40:24.197 --> 00:40:26.768
We have greater stamina.

1091
00:40:26.768 --> 00:40:28.898
- We run until it gets tired. - That's right.

1092
00:40:28.898 --> 00:40:29.907
(It's a matter of who grows tired first.)

1093
00:40:29.907 --> 00:40:31.308
(While Kang Nam shows his determination)

1094
00:40:31.308 --> 00:40:33.407
My goodness, it's growing on soil.

1095
00:40:34.337 --> 00:40:36.047
This coconut is growing on soil.

1096
00:40:36.047 --> 00:40:38.748
(Moon Sik changes the subject because he is embarrassed.)

1097
00:40:39.918 --> 00:40:41.418
Let's go around it.

1098
00:40:41.418 --> 00:40:43.018
(They resume the hunt.)

1099
00:40:43.018 --> 00:40:44.047
(Throwing)

1100
00:40:44.047 --> 00:40:45.118
I bet it's in the bushes.

1101
00:40:46.458 --> 00:40:49.018
(Kang Nam plans to catch a chicken when it runs out to avoid the rock.)

1102
00:40:50.058 --> 00:40:51.087
I can hear it.

1103
00:40:51.087 --> 00:40:53.427
(Moon Sik plans to catch a chicken in a dense forest.)

1104
00:40:53.427 --> 00:40:55.828
(He goes deeper into the forest to make up for his earlier mistake.)

1105
00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:58.598
(Which hunter will be victorious?)

1106
00:41:00.598 --> 00:41:01.637
It must be hiding.

1107
00:41:01.637 --> 00:41:03.567
(The passionate man is also searching for chickens.)

1108
00:41:03.567 --> 00:41:05.337
(Where is it?)

1109
00:41:06.208 --> 00:41:08.177
(The chicken doesn't come out.)

1110
00:41:08.177 --> 00:41:09.177
I don't see it.

1111
00:41:11.007 --> 00:41:12.978
(The search goes on for a while.)

1112
00:41:12.978 --> 00:41:15.018
Where did Moon Sik go?

1113
00:41:17.447 --> 00:41:18.788
(They don't see Moon Sik anywhere.)

1114
00:41:18.788 --> 00:41:21.018
- Did he disappear on his own? - He always disappears.

1115
00:41:21.018 --> 00:41:22.087
Did he go without a camera?

1116
00:41:23.027 --> 00:41:24.058
Did he go without a camera?

1117
00:41:24.857 --> 00:41:28.728
(All the cameras are on them.)

1118
00:41:29.297 --> 00:41:32.268
Gosh, we now have to catch Moon Sik instead of a chicken.

1119
00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:34.237
(Moon Sik is immature.)

1120
00:41:34.237 --> 00:41:35.237
Let's go.

1121
00:41:35.967 --> 00:41:38.208
He will return when he is tired.

1122
00:41:39.337 --> 00:41:40.337
Moon Sik!

1123
00:41:40.337 --> 00:41:42.038
(The producer and the cameraman search for Moon Sik.)

1124
00:41:42.038 --> 00:41:43.107
Moon Sik!

1125
00:41:43.607 --> 00:41:45.308
The staff is searching for Moon Sik.

1126
00:41:45.308 --> 00:41:47.918
- Lee Moon Sik! - Lee Moon Sik.

1127
00:41:48.578 --> 00:41:50.648
- Lee Moon Sik! - Moon Sik!

1128
00:41:50.648 --> 00:41:51.688
Moon Sik!

1129
00:41:51.918 --> 00:41:53.618
(Quiet)

1130
00:41:55.018 --> 00:41:57.188
Kang Nam! Yun Hyeong!

1131
00:41:57.188 --> 00:41:58.328
(Moon Sik's voice is being recorded without a camera.)

1132
00:41:58.328 --> 00:41:59.328
Where are you?

1133
00:41:59.328 --> 00:42:00.357
(There is a chicken.)

1134
00:42:00.357 --> 00:42:01.427
There is a chicken.

1135
00:42:01.857 --> 00:42:03.998
(Thud)

1136
00:42:03.998 --> 00:42:05.567
(My goodness.)

1137
00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:06.837
I need someone to steer the chicken.

1138
00:42:06.837 --> 00:42:08.898
(I need someone to steer the chicken.)

1139
00:42:08.898 --> 00:42:11.567
(This is what he did.)

1140
00:42:11.567 --> 00:42:14.337
(They find Moon Sik after wandering for a while.)

1141
00:42:14.677 --> 00:42:16.547
This is incredible.

1142
00:42:17.378 --> 00:42:19.277
Wait a minute. I spotted a chicken.

1143
00:42:19.618 --> 00:42:20.618
Hold on.

1144
00:42:20.618 --> 00:42:22.217
(A wild chicken appears.)

1145
00:42:22.217 --> 00:42:23.217
Let's go this way.

1146
00:42:28.827 --> 00:42:30.697
This is incredible.

1147
00:42:31.528 --> 00:42:33.427
Wait a minute. I spotted a chicken.

1148
00:42:33.768 --> 00:42:34.768
Hold on.

1149
00:42:34.768 --> 00:42:36.367
(A wild chicken appears.)

1150
00:42:36.367 --> 00:42:37.367
Let's go this way.

1151
00:42:38.137 --> 00:42:39.137
All right.

1152
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.920
(It's a chicken.)

1153
00:42:43.344 --> 00:42:46.145
Kang Nam, a chicken is going that way.

1154
00:42:46.445 --> 00:42:47.585
(I will catch it no matter what.)

1155
00:42:47.585 --> 00:42:49.355
- Is it coming this way? - Yes, I spotted a chicken.

1156
00:42:49.915 --> 00:42:50.954
Where is it?

1157
00:42:50.954 --> 00:42:54.154
(Kang Nam and Yun Hyeong surround the chicken.)

1158
00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:55.224
I don't see it.

1159
00:42:55.925 --> 00:42:56.994
Do you see it?

1160
00:42:56.994 --> 00:42:57.994
(They are on standby.)

1161
00:42:57.994 --> 00:42:59.025
Where is it?

1162
00:42:59.565 --> 00:43:02.295
I don't see anything. The forest is dense.

1163
00:43:02.295 --> 00:43:04.335
There it is. It's on the tree.

1164
00:43:04.335 --> 00:43:05.404
- There it is. - Where is it?

1165
00:43:05.404 --> 00:43:06.465
- There. - It's on the tree.

1166
00:43:06.764 --> 00:43:07.775
Where?

1167
00:43:08.605 --> 00:43:09.704
It's going that way.

1168
00:43:10.605 --> 00:43:12.375
It's going that way.

1169
00:43:13.244 --> 00:43:15.474
(Where is it?)

1170
00:43:17.614 --> 00:43:21.654
(At that moment,)

1171
00:43:21.654 --> 00:43:24.154
(the chicken becomes surprised by Kang Nam and jumps out.)

1172
00:43:24.925 --> 00:43:27.224
My goodness.

1173
00:43:27.224 --> 00:43:28.554
(Without missing a beat, Kang Nam throws his body.)

1174
00:43:28.554 --> 00:43:30.824
(Kang Nam versus the wild chicken)

1175
00:43:30.824 --> 00:43:31.864
- Did you catch it? - I caught it.

1176
00:43:31.864 --> 00:43:34.235
(Kang Nam wins.)

1177
00:43:34.235 --> 00:43:35.235
My goodness.

1178
00:43:35.994 --> 00:43:36.994
You are the best.

1179
00:43:36.994 --> 00:43:38.165
(Kang Nam did it.)

1180
00:43:38.165 --> 00:43:39.165
Don't hurt it.

1181
00:43:39.864 --> 00:43:40.904
Be careful.

1182
00:43:40.904 --> 00:43:42.375
(He is the ace member.)

1183
00:43:43.474 --> 00:43:44.675
(I respect you.)

1184
00:43:44.675 --> 00:43:45.675
You are incredible.

1185
00:43:46.505 --> 00:43:47.545
It passed by in front of me.

1186
00:43:47.545 --> 00:43:48.915
(The man who spotted the chicken, Moon Sik joins them.)

1187
00:43:48.915 --> 00:43:49.974
(Kang Nam caught it.)

1188
00:43:49.974 --> 00:43:51.284
May I try holding it?

1189
00:43:51.415 --> 00:43:54.784
(Is he intercepting the chicken?)

1190
00:43:54.784 --> 00:43:56.755
(He takes a look.)

1191
00:43:56.755 --> 00:43:59.255
- It's big. - It has a lot of meat.

1192
00:43:59.255 --> 00:44:01.625
Your experiences in the jungle weren't wasted.

1193
00:44:01.654 --> 00:44:03.554
- You're right. - You have changed.

1194
00:44:03.554 --> 00:44:05.925
Kang Nam catches everything he sees.

1195
00:44:05.925 --> 00:44:07.565
Even eels too.

1196
00:44:08.264 --> 00:44:09.465
It was hiding.

1197
00:44:09.934 --> 00:44:12.704
I was just passing by...

1198
00:44:12.704 --> 00:44:15.204
I became discouraged because Kang Nam caught a chicken.

1199
00:44:16.434 --> 00:44:18.675
It happened in an instant.

1200
00:44:18.675 --> 00:44:20.974
I thought I would come up with a plan...

1201
00:44:20.974 --> 00:44:24.074
and encircle the chicken, but Kang Nam caught it first.

1202
00:44:24.074 --> 00:44:25.114
(I should have caught it.)

1203
00:44:25.945 --> 00:44:27.654
I was happy, but dispirited.

1204
00:44:29.915 --> 00:44:31.154
You are incredible.

1205
00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:32.755
(You are incredible.)

1206
00:44:32.755 --> 00:44:33.784
(Hitting)

1207
00:44:33.784 --> 00:44:35.454
Let's catch a few chickens today.

1208
00:44:35.654 --> 00:44:38.625
Let's tie this one and catch more chickens.

1209
00:44:38.625 --> 00:44:41.295
- We can catch other birds. - We can boil the chicken.

1210
00:44:42.994 --> 00:44:46.434
Unknowing of the successful chicken hunt,

1211
00:44:46.434 --> 00:44:48.375
the Exploration Team roams the Garden of the Spirits.

1212
00:44:50.005 --> 00:44:51.304
There are so many mushrooms.

1213
00:44:52.244 --> 00:44:54.715
(Is there any mushroom that starts with "M"?)

1214
00:44:55.839 --> 00:45:00.839
<b><font color="#ff80ff">Subtitle by VIU.
Ripped & Synced by KylieKyle.</font></b>

1215
00:45:01.715 --> 00:45:04.585
(What is that sound?)

1216
00:45:07.085 --> 00:45:08.925
The locals say...

1217
00:45:09.895 --> 00:45:13.795
there is a bird inside the tree.

1218
00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:14.994
- A bird? - A bird.

1219
00:45:15.835 --> 00:45:17.704
- Inside the tree? - Yes.

1220
00:45:17.704 --> 00:45:18.735
Can we catch it?

1221
00:45:19.034 --> 00:45:21.005
- Would it be possible? - It looks like...

1222
00:45:21.005 --> 00:45:22.634
there will be something.

1223
00:45:22.634 --> 00:45:25.175
- The tree looks like a protector. - It will be cozy inside the tree.

1224
00:45:25.175 --> 00:45:26.304
We should look from the above.

1225
00:45:27.145 --> 00:45:28.215
Do you want to take a look?

1226
00:45:28.315 --> 00:45:29.514
I am really heavy.

1227
00:45:30.145 --> 00:45:32.085
(Really?)

1228
00:45:32.415 --> 00:45:33.815
- Cho Rong should do it. - No, no.

1229
00:45:33.815 --> 00:45:36.554
- I gained a lot of weight. - Tae Gon is very strong.

1230
00:45:36.554 --> 00:45:38.585
- Then lift me up. - He even caught dolphinfish.

1231
00:45:38.585 --> 00:45:39.855
Climb on my back.

1232
00:45:39.855 --> 00:45:41.695
I gained weight because this is my off-season.

1233
00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:42.755
(I am sorry.)

1234
00:45:42.755 --> 00:45:43.954
I am sorry, Tae Gon.

1235
00:45:44.395 --> 00:45:45.465
Wait a minute.

1236
00:45:46.324 --> 00:45:47.864
I weigh more than I look.

1237
00:45:48.034 --> 00:45:52.034
(He defies gravity and lifts her up.)

1238
00:45:52.034 --> 00:45:53.264
Be careful. Don't push him.

1239
00:45:53.965 --> 00:45:55.634
I can see it.

1240
00:45:56.335 --> 00:45:57.404
I can see it.

1241
00:45:57.404 --> 00:45:58.605
- There is something inside. - I can hear the sound.

1242
00:45:58.875 --> 00:46:00.875
- I see green feathers. - What do you see?

1243
00:46:00.875 --> 00:46:02.815
- I see green feathers. - What do they look like?

1244
00:46:02.815 --> 00:46:04.315
It has a blue tail.

1245
00:46:04.315 --> 00:46:05.315
Is it a baby bird?

1246
00:46:05.315 --> 00:46:06.684
- How many birds are there? - Two.

1247
00:46:06.684 --> 00:46:07.715
- Two? - Are they baby birds?

1248
00:46:07.715 --> 00:46:08.755
Hello.

1249
00:46:09.114 --> 00:46:10.114
Are they baby birds?

1250
00:46:10.514 --> 00:46:12.784
They aren't baby birds. They are the size of my palm.

1251
00:46:12.784 --> 00:46:15.824
(They become more curious. What kind of a bird are they?)

1252
00:46:15.824 --> 00:46:16.855
They are this big.

1253
00:46:17.054 --> 00:46:18.264
- Please film it. - Okay.

1254
00:46:18.264 --> 00:46:19.395
(Bo Mi takes the camera.)

1255
00:46:19.395 --> 00:46:21.264
Try to record it.

1256
00:46:21.665 --> 00:46:22.735
(Let's move on.)

1257
00:46:22.735 --> 00:46:25.204
I'm so fascinated. Hello.

1258
00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:28.074
(There are two small green birds side by side.)

1259
00:46:28.074 --> 00:46:29.434
- Oh, dear. - We have them too.

1260
00:46:29.434 --> 00:46:31.275
They look like parrots.

1261
00:46:32.545 --> 00:46:33.875
- Parrots. - Parrots?

1262
00:46:34.244 --> 00:46:36.014
- They're parrots. - Parrots, right?

1263
00:46:36.014 --> 00:46:37.415
No wonder they're that color.

1264
00:46:37.945 --> 00:46:39.585
(Two small parrots are hiding.)

1265
00:46:39.585 --> 00:46:41.514
I'm so fascinated.

1266
00:46:41.514 --> 00:46:44.114
It looks like a bird's nest.

1267
00:46:45.154 --> 00:46:46.784
Cho Rong has to see it too.

1268
00:46:46.884 --> 00:46:48.054
Cho Rong wants to see it too.

1269
00:46:48.454 --> 00:46:49.755
(Wink)

1270
00:46:49.855 --> 00:46:50.864
(Hello)

1271
00:46:50.864 --> 00:46:52.065
- Cho Rong has to see it too. - It's okay.

1272
00:46:52.065 --> 00:46:53.264
There's Dam.

1273
00:46:53.264 --> 00:46:54.335
Hello.

1274
00:46:54.335 --> 00:46:55.594
(Bo Mi doesn't take too long.)

1275
00:46:55.594 --> 00:46:57.364
- That's good now. Thank you. - All right.

1276
00:46:57.364 --> 00:46:58.404
- Aren't you happy you did that? - Yes.

1277
00:46:58.404 --> 00:47:01.505
Hello. This is so fascinating.

1278
00:47:02.804 --> 00:47:04.304
They're so green.

1279
00:47:04.304 --> 00:47:05.304
(It's a cute nesting place.)

1280
00:47:05.304 --> 00:47:07.844
Hello. I'm Apink.

1281
00:47:08.574 --> 00:47:10.445
Hello. What are you doing?

1282
00:47:10.445 --> 00:47:11.485
You start talking.

1283
00:47:11.485 --> 00:47:13.215
- Did you eat? - They're so lovely.

1284
00:47:13.215 --> 00:47:14.915
- Are they pretty? - They are.

1285
00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:16.384
(She's happy looking at them.)

1286
00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:20.184
- They're green. - Right.

1287
00:47:20.184 --> 00:47:21.594
(Tae Gon and Dam watch the video.)

1288
00:47:21.594 --> 00:47:23.125
They're so cute.

1289
00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:25.295
- You have to see them. - Exactly.

1290
00:47:25.295 --> 00:47:27.065
Let's leave a camera here.

1291
00:47:27.065 --> 00:47:29.494
- The mother bird might get scared. - We should go.

1292
00:47:29.494 --> 00:47:30.695
Sure. We got it.

1293
00:47:31.264 --> 00:47:32.304
- They're so pretty. - Let's go.

1294
00:47:33.404 --> 00:47:34.434
Let's go.

1295
00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:38.344
They leave a camera just to look at it a bit more.

1296
00:47:41.114 --> 00:47:42.315
In a moment,

1297
00:47:42.645 --> 00:47:44.715
the parrots start getting busy.

1298
00:47:46.114 --> 00:47:47.114
(Fluttering)

1299
00:47:48.784 --> 00:47:51.054
By the look of the big wings,

1300
00:47:51.054 --> 00:47:53.485
it looks like the mother parrot is back.

1301
00:47:57.324 --> 00:47:59.565
(She's careful.)

1302
00:47:59.565 --> 00:48:02.165
She comes down carefully...

1303
00:48:02.165 --> 00:48:05.034
as to not hurt the baby parrots.

1304
00:48:05.235 --> 00:48:07.434
(How are my babies doing?)

1305
00:48:07.434 --> 00:48:09.605
(I'm hungry, Mommy.)

1306
00:48:12.175 --> 00:48:14.175
She must have come back from hunting.

1307
00:48:14.175 --> 00:48:17.884
She feeds the baby parrots by mouth.

1308
00:48:22.654 --> 00:48:24.284
(I want more, Mommy.)

1309
00:48:31.494 --> 00:48:34.594
(She comes down...)

1310
00:48:34.594 --> 00:48:37.434
(and gives them everything.)

1311
00:48:43.005 --> 00:48:45.344
After a short reunion,

1312
00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:48.275
mother parrot leaves again to hunt.

1313
00:48:48.945 --> 00:48:50.645
(Don't fight. Make sure you get along.)

1314
00:48:50.645 --> 00:48:52.684
(See you later, Mommy.)

1315
00:48:53.715 --> 00:48:56.184
Baby parrots, please don't get hurt...

1316
00:48:56.184 --> 00:48:57.855
and grow up healthy.

1317
00:49:01.525 --> 00:49:03.554
Meanwhile, there's a person...

1318
00:49:03.554 --> 00:49:06.125
who's left alone just like the baby birds.

1319
00:49:06.565 --> 00:49:09.895
He's busy digging up yams from deep within the earth.

1320
00:49:11.735 --> 00:49:13.335
Will I dig it up today?

1321
00:49:14.574 --> 00:49:15.634
They look like this, right?

1322
00:49:15.634 --> 00:49:16.634
(It's stuck in the earth.)

1323
00:49:18.445 --> 00:49:21.014
(He digs,)

1324
00:49:21.014 --> 00:49:23.244
(pulls,)

1325
00:49:23.244 --> 00:49:25.744
(and digs some more.)

1326
00:49:29.054 --> 00:49:30.154
They look like this.

1327
00:49:30.154 --> 00:49:31.724
They look somewhat like this.

1328
00:49:31.954 --> 00:49:34.125
(He pulls 1 out after 20 minutes.)

1329
00:49:35.525 --> 00:49:38.425
(It's too small.)

1330
00:49:41.364 --> 00:49:43.795
(He's covered in sweat.)

1331
00:49:45.204 --> 00:49:47.574
(He breathes heavily.)

1332
00:49:49.574 --> 00:49:52.175
(Nobody is watching,)

1333
00:49:52.175 --> 00:49:53.175
This is yam.

1334
00:49:53.175 --> 00:49:56.645
(but Jin Woon keeps on digging.)

1335
00:49:59.085 --> 00:50:01.715
(Finally)

1336
00:50:01.715 --> 00:50:04.224
(He digs up a big one.)

1337
00:50:04.485 --> 00:50:07.485
(Nobody is there to watch him.)

1338
00:50:09.395 --> 00:50:13.324
(He shows it to the camera.)

1339
00:50:13.565 --> 00:50:16.895
(I'm lonely.)

1340
00:50:18.304 --> 00:50:20.034
Isn't this a palm tree?

1341
00:50:20.335 --> 00:50:21.434
You got it.

1342
00:50:21.434 --> 00:50:22.434
(Dam is busy searching too.)

1343
00:50:22.434 --> 00:50:23.704
You know so much.

1344
00:50:23.704 --> 00:50:26.304
This is a palm tree. There's shoot underneath.

1345
00:50:26.304 --> 00:50:28.445
It's edible. I remember from before.

1346
00:50:29.775 --> 00:50:32.014
(He's unstoppable.)

1347
00:50:32.014 --> 00:50:33.184
You're a tough guy, Dam.

1348
00:50:33.844 --> 00:50:36.114
He's a man.

1349
00:50:37.215 --> 00:50:39.025
(You look cool, Dam.)

1350
00:50:39.025 --> 00:50:40.085
Do you think so?

1351
00:50:41.255 --> 00:50:42.425
It's huge.

1352
00:50:42.425 --> 00:50:43.454
(Hitting)

1353
00:50:44.395 --> 00:50:45.824
(He's not holding it right.)

1354
00:50:45.824 --> 00:50:47.764
(He changes his grip smoothly.)

1355
00:50:47.764 --> 00:50:50.634
(He's a professional butcher.)

1356
00:50:52.864 --> 00:50:55.034
That looked really cool.

1357
00:50:55.074 --> 00:50:56.474
Goodness.

1358
00:50:56.934 --> 00:50:59.005
(He's so fast.)

1359
00:51:00.675 --> 00:51:01.744
- You are amazing. - You are great.

1360
00:51:01.744 --> 00:51:02.815
You are a man.

1361
00:51:03.645 --> 00:51:06.184
(They keep praising him.)

1362
00:51:06.184 --> 00:51:07.755
(He's satisfied.)

1363
00:51:08.014 --> 00:51:11.554
If people keep praising you, you get so energized.

1364
00:51:12.755 --> 00:51:14.925
(He picks up more speed.)

1365
00:51:14.925 --> 00:51:16.654
(It never stops.)

1366
00:51:17.125 --> 00:51:19.494
- Rip it. - "Rip it?"

1367
00:51:20.295 --> 00:51:23.295
(Cho Rong knows how to control Dam.)

1368
00:51:23.295 --> 00:51:25.304
(A little bit more)

1369
00:51:25.304 --> 00:51:26.304
Stop it, Cho Rong.

1370
00:51:26.304 --> 00:51:28.275
(Please stop, Cho Rong.)

1371
00:51:29.335 --> 00:51:32.645
Can't you cut it in half? With the knife?

1372
00:51:32.645 --> 00:51:35.145
- Like this? - No, vertically.

1373
00:51:36.344 --> 00:51:38.645
(Try it, Tae Gon.)

1374
00:51:38.645 --> 00:51:40.514
(Grinning)

1375
00:51:41.085 --> 00:51:42.654
He's a man.

1376
00:51:42.654 --> 00:51:43.815
(Here comes King Tae Gon.)

1377
00:51:45.054 --> 00:51:46.184
You're a man.

1378
00:51:46.184 --> 00:51:47.384
(He fixes the knife in place.)

1379
00:51:47.384 --> 00:51:49.494
(Slipping)

1380
00:51:49.824 --> 00:51:52.195
(Don't do this.)

1381
00:51:53.724 --> 00:51:57.065
(His cheeks turn red from embarrassment.)

1382
00:51:59.235 --> 00:52:01.275
- That was so funny. - That's cool.

1383
00:52:01.275 --> 00:52:02.704
- This is edible. - It worked.

1384
00:52:02.704 --> 00:52:03.835
- The white part. - Right.

1385
00:52:04.474 --> 00:52:05.945
We wanted to eat this, right?

1386
00:52:05.945 --> 00:52:07.775
It looks like a mushroom.

1387
00:52:07.775 --> 00:52:08.974
How do we eat this?

1388
00:52:08.974 --> 00:52:10.375
- You just eat it. - Do you chew and spit it out?

1389
00:52:10.375 --> 00:52:11.545
No, you just eat it.

1390
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:12.645
(It's crunchy.)

1391
00:52:12.645 --> 00:52:13.715
You just eat it.

1392
00:52:14.184 --> 00:52:15.255
(It makes her smile.)

1393
00:52:15.255 --> 00:52:16.284
What's this?

1394
00:52:16.585 --> 00:52:17.585
(It's soft and has a light taste.)

1395
00:52:17.585 --> 00:52:19.724
This is so interesting.

1396
00:52:19.724 --> 00:52:21.295
It tastes like raw sweet potato.

1397
00:52:21.295 --> 00:52:22.755
But it's so soft.

1398
00:52:22.755 --> 00:52:24.994
- It's good. - It's good.

1399
00:52:25.494 --> 00:52:26.695
Let's take some.

1400
00:52:26.695 --> 00:52:27.895
- It's good. - We should.

1401
00:52:28.235 --> 00:52:29.494
It's so heavy.

1402
00:52:30.094 --> 00:52:31.264
- It's heavy? - Yes.

1403
00:52:31.264 --> 00:52:32.505
- Really? - It's quite full.

1404
00:52:33.465 --> 00:52:36.235
- Jin Woon is still working. - We have to go to him.

1405
00:52:37.875 --> 00:52:40.275
Meanwhile, with Moon Sik in the lead,

1406
00:52:40.275 --> 00:52:42.415
the three members move towards shoreline.

1407
00:52:42.415 --> 00:52:47.215
If we catch gastropods, conches, or abalones,

1408
00:52:47.215 --> 00:52:51.184
we can boil them. It'll make a very healthy soup.

1409
00:52:51.525 --> 00:52:53.085
- Abalones! - Abalones.

1410
00:52:53.085 --> 00:52:55.594
- It's all-natural here. - It is.

1411
00:52:55.594 --> 00:52:57.094
- Abalones are expensive. - Of course.

1412
00:52:57.695 --> 00:52:59.324
- Let's catch them. - This is so refreshing.

1413
00:52:59.395 --> 00:53:01.335
It's nicer near the water.

1414
00:53:02.395 --> 00:53:03.534
It's so refreshing.

1415
00:53:03.534 --> 00:53:04.934
Can't we sleep here?

1416
00:53:04.934 --> 00:53:06.465
It's refreshing here.

1417
00:53:07.675 --> 00:53:10.005
Can't we sleep there? There's a cave.

1418
00:53:10.235 --> 00:53:11.574
Really?

1419
00:53:12.145 --> 00:53:13.704
There's a cave.

1420
00:53:14.744 --> 00:53:16.945
(They find something as soon as they arrive.)

1421
00:53:17.215 --> 00:53:18.284
There's a cave.

1422
00:53:18.744 --> 00:53:19.945
Goodness.

1423
00:53:20.184 --> 00:53:21.315
- What's that? - My gosh.

1424
00:53:22.014 --> 00:53:24.014
- What is that? - We can sleep here.

1425
00:53:24.554 --> 00:53:26.425
(Why is there a hideout by the water?)

1426
00:53:28.855 --> 00:53:29.954
It's nice.

1427
00:53:30.125 --> 00:53:32.625
We should have slept here when it rained on the first day.

1428
00:53:33.864 --> 00:53:36.835
They find a home unexpectedly by the beach.

1429
00:53:38.364 --> 00:53:40.934
It's a sculpture designed by nature.

1430
00:53:40.934 --> 00:53:41.974
(What is this structure?)

1431
00:53:43.235 --> 00:53:46.175
After the lava cave got eroded by the waves,

1432
00:53:46.175 --> 00:53:49.574
a part of it was left and formed a bridge.

1433
00:53:52.045 --> 00:53:54.585
We should eat chicken in a cool area.

1434
00:53:55.485 --> 00:53:57.315
We'll be able to light a fire easily here.

1435
00:53:57.315 --> 00:53:59.154
If the eight of us lie down here, that'll be perfect.

1436
00:53:59.154 --> 00:54:01.025
- Exactly. - No, let's not tell others.

1437
00:54:01.025 --> 00:54:03.195
- Why not? - The three of us...

1438
00:54:03.195 --> 00:54:05.724
- can sleep here. - Kang Nam.

1439
00:54:05.764 --> 00:54:06.965
We came as a team.

1440
00:54:06.965 --> 00:54:08.534
- How can you think that way? - What do you mean?

1441
00:54:08.534 --> 00:54:10.264
- We have to sleep together. - To Kang Nam,

1442
00:54:10.264 --> 00:54:13.434
other members are just strangers.

1443
00:54:13.704 --> 00:54:14.875
(They're just strangers.)

1444
00:54:16.335 --> 00:54:17.375
They're just strangers?

1445
00:54:17.375 --> 00:54:18.574
You turned weird.

1446
00:54:18.574 --> 00:54:20.545
That's an old man's joke. Don't do it.

1447
00:54:20.545 --> 00:54:21.614
- You're only 23. - He's much better.

1448
00:54:21.614 --> 00:54:22.844
I learned so much from Moon Sik yesterday.

1449
00:54:22.844 --> 00:54:24.445
Why would you learn that from him?

1450
00:54:24.445 --> 00:54:26.945
- They're just strangers. - What do you think my type is?

1451
00:54:26.945 --> 00:54:27.985
- What? - My blood type.

1452
00:54:27.985 --> 00:54:29.614
Your blood type? B.

1453
00:54:29.684 --> 00:54:30.755
- Type O. - You're wrong.

1454
00:54:30.755 --> 00:54:31.925
They're just strangers.

1455
00:54:31.925 --> 00:54:33.684
A? Tell me. What is it?

1456
00:54:33.684 --> 00:54:34.695
What is it?

1457
00:54:34.695 --> 00:54:36.695
He's type Yun Hyeong.

1458
00:54:37.324 --> 00:54:38.665
I'm going home.

1459
00:54:38.764 --> 00:54:41.534
Can I get a flight ticket? This is too hard for me.

1460
00:54:41.534 --> 00:54:43.764
They're just strangers to Kang Nam. That was a good one.

1461
00:54:43.764 --> 00:54:46.204
If you spend time with him, you'll fall into his charms.

1462
00:54:46.204 --> 00:54:47.835
It's charming.

1463
00:54:48.335 --> 00:54:50.634
Aren't there a lot of fish here?

1464
00:54:50.974 --> 00:54:52.244
There must be.

1465
00:54:53.074 --> 00:54:54.875
Moon Sik, there's fish here.

1466
00:54:55.375 --> 00:54:56.514
There's fish.

1467
00:54:56.514 --> 00:54:58.244
There's a crab.

1468
00:54:58.244 --> 00:54:59.815
It's huge.

1469
00:54:59.815 --> 00:55:01.855
- This is great, Kang Nam. - Be careful.

1470
00:55:01.855 --> 00:55:04.085
(Moon Sik goes first.)

1471
00:55:04.085 --> 00:55:05.585
There are so many crabs.

1472
00:55:05.585 --> 00:55:07.925
- These are all crabs. - There are so many of them.

1473
00:55:07.925 --> 00:55:08.925
(Is this where the crabs inhabit?)

1474
00:55:09.395 --> 00:55:10.554
Look at that crab.

1475
00:55:13.395 --> 00:55:15.895
(Is this the stone crab I saw on TV?)

1476
00:55:15.895 --> 00:55:17.094
It's jumping.

1477
00:55:17.634 --> 00:55:20.264
- We can't even eat it. - Really?

1478
00:55:20.364 --> 00:55:22.074
Moon Sik, do you see any fish?

1479
00:55:22.534 --> 00:55:24.804
Fish? I think there are a lot.

1480
00:55:25.974 --> 00:55:27.175
(At that moment)

1481
00:55:27.175 --> 00:55:29.215
- Moon Sik. - Be careful, Moon Sik.

1482
00:55:29.645 --> 00:55:31.284
(The wave slapped him.)

1483
00:55:31.514 --> 00:55:34.554
(It makes you act humble.)

1484
00:55:34.554 --> 00:55:36.154
We have to go in. There's no other way.

1485
00:55:36.154 --> 00:55:37.154
(There's no point staying outside of the water.)

1486
00:55:37.154 --> 00:55:39.684
We can snorkel here. Let's snorkel.

1487
00:55:39.784 --> 00:55:42.925
We can find clams or crayfish inside the water.

1488
00:55:42.925 --> 00:55:44.125
Let's do that.

1489
00:55:44.125 --> 00:55:46.125
- Do you like going in the water? - I love it.

1490
00:55:47.934 --> 00:55:51.804
(They're busy getting ready to go in the water.)

1491
00:55:54.065 --> 00:55:55.704
I said I wanted to go hunting with you.

1492
00:55:55.704 --> 00:55:56.735
Really?

1493
00:55:57.105 --> 00:55:58.404
- Because... - Really?

1494
00:55:58.404 --> 00:56:01.175
I watched you...

1495
00:56:01.175 --> 00:56:03.614
catching a crayfish.

1496
00:56:03.614 --> 00:56:05.844
That's why I learned to snorkel.

1497
00:56:05.844 --> 00:56:07.145
- Because of me? - Yes.

1498
00:56:08.255 --> 00:56:09.715
(Before leaving for the jungle)

1499
00:56:09.715 --> 00:56:12.025
(He got trained in free diving.)

1500
00:56:12.925 --> 00:56:14.494
(Let's hunt together, Kang Nam.)

1501
00:56:14.954 --> 00:56:16.425
I went down 7m.

1502
00:56:16.425 --> 00:56:17.824
Really? It'll be no problem for you.

1503
00:56:17.824 --> 00:56:19.594
- This is only 3 to 4m. - Really?

1504
00:56:19.594 --> 00:56:21.264
- Let's catch crayfish today. - And let's enjoy them today too.

1505
00:56:21.264 --> 00:56:22.864
Right on. I'll tell you if I spot one.

1506
00:56:22.864 --> 00:56:24.065
- You should catch it. - Sure.

1507
00:56:24.304 --> 00:56:25.505
- You have to hold it tightly. - Got it.

1508
00:56:26.434 --> 00:56:28.304
- Let's get going. - The water is cold.

1509
00:56:29.304 --> 00:56:31.574
(These two dip themselves into the water side by side.)

1510
00:56:32.775 --> 00:56:34.514
(Yun Hyeong dives into the water for the first time.)

1511
00:56:36.315 --> 00:56:37.344
Go!

1512
00:56:37.645 --> 00:56:39.684
(What will they spot under the sea?)

1513
00:56:40.954 --> 00:56:42.454
(Kang Nam takes the lead.)

1514
00:56:42.454 --> 00:56:43.585
(Yun Hyeong follows after him.)

1515
00:56:46.855 --> 00:56:47.855
(Kang Nam dives in first.)

1516
00:56:49.695 --> 00:56:52.764
(I can't believe that I actually got to see that in person.)

1517
00:56:53.695 --> 00:56:56.534
(Yun Hyeong dives deep into the water following in his footsteps.)

1518
00:56:56.534 --> 00:56:58.034
(He's glued to Kang Nam like a gum.)

1519
00:56:59.804 --> 00:57:01.934
(The sea in the jungle is so real.)

1520
00:57:04.074 --> 00:57:07.445
I must say, the sea and the swimming pool are different.

1521
00:57:07.514 --> 00:57:11.284
I'm more scared of the swimming pool because nothing is in it,

1522
00:57:11.545 --> 00:57:14.585
but the sea was like a painting.

1523
00:57:14.585 --> 00:57:17.925
So I was able to hold in my breath longer than usual.

1524
00:57:17.985 --> 00:57:19.025
I was busy admiring the view.

1525
00:57:19.025 --> 00:57:20.925
(The view under the sea makes him gape and stare.)

1526
00:57:21.795 --> 00:57:22.855
(Looking around)

1527
00:57:22.855 --> 00:57:26.224
I was really happy that I got to share it with Kang Nam.

1528
00:57:26.565 --> 00:57:28.264
(I'm a big fan of Kang Nam.)

1529
00:57:29.264 --> 00:57:31.065
(He's done admiring the scenery.)

1530
00:57:31.065 --> 00:57:32.764
(He starts hunting for fish.)

1531
00:57:33.704 --> 00:57:34.934
(I'll search this area first.)

1532
00:57:38.574 --> 00:57:41.574
(Yun Hyeong follows him right away.)

1533
00:57:41.574 --> 00:57:42.945
(Their underwater hunting starts.)

1534
00:57:45.784 --> 00:57:47.585
(Let me see.)

1535
00:57:47.585 --> 00:57:50.585
(Kang Nam begins searches his surroundings thoroughly first.)

1536
00:57:52.025 --> 00:57:53.654
(He's through.)

1537
00:57:56.054 --> 00:57:57.665
(Success doesn't come right away.)

1538
00:57:59.364 --> 00:58:02.534
(He fixes his swimming goggles.)

1539
00:58:02.534 --> 00:58:04.634
(He moves swiftly as if his feet are made of motors.)

1540
00:58:04.634 --> 00:58:06.264
(Did he spot something?)

1541
00:58:10.775 --> 00:58:12.945
(Tiger cowries are popular ornaments as they are huge and glossy.)

1542
00:58:15.514 --> 00:58:16.514
(Kang Nam picks it.)

1543
00:58:17.275 --> 00:58:18.784
(I want this more because it's pretty.)

1544
00:58:22.154 --> 00:58:24.324
(In no time, Kang Nam's fan comes to his side.)

1545
00:58:26.255 --> 00:58:27.255
(Diving in)

1546
00:58:28.795 --> 00:58:30.054
(He strives to be quicker...)

1547
00:58:30.054 --> 00:58:31.764
(and go deeper.)

1548
00:58:34.534 --> 00:58:38.864
(These are small clams which are hard to spot,)

1549
00:58:38.864 --> 00:58:39.864
(but this veteran picks it up.)

1550
00:58:40.704 --> 00:58:42.675
(Yun Hyeong, this is how you do it.)

1551
00:58:45.375 --> 00:58:46.775
(Yun Hyeong understands it.)

1552
00:58:48.614 --> 00:58:50.445
(This is his first time hunting underwater at last.)

1553
00:58:51.545 --> 00:58:53.244
(He spots his prey.)

1554
00:58:54.915 --> 00:58:56.384
(After aiming at it,)

1555
00:58:56.384 --> 00:58:58.224
(he continues to shoot.)

1556
00:59:05.025 --> 00:59:07.395
(He misses the target 3 times in a row.)

1557
00:59:07.395 --> 00:59:08.565
(It looked easy on TV.)

1558
00:59:11.065 --> 00:59:12.665
(He gets his harpoon ready again.)

1559
00:59:13.864 --> 00:59:16.534
(Wait! That's the same one from earlier.)

1560
00:59:16.534 --> 00:59:18.445
(It swims away quickly.)

1561
00:59:18.445 --> 00:59:20.545
(It's too fast. There's no way I can catch that.)

1562
00:59:21.415 --> 00:59:22.775
Yun Hyeong, did you see any fish?

1563
00:59:23.775 --> 00:59:26.085
Fish are faster than I thought.

1564
00:59:26.085 --> 00:59:28.784
(Yun Hyeong, the representative of viewers, gives it 5 stars.)

1565
00:59:29.514 --> 00:59:30.554
Where is it?

1566
00:59:31.184 --> 00:59:33.454
(Meanwhile, Moon Sik is hunting as well.)

1567
00:59:35.454 --> 00:59:38.025
(Let me show you the power of a man at the age of 50.)

1568
00:59:41.465 --> 00:59:43.364
(This fish is big and has a fancy pattern.)

1569
00:59:45.034 --> 00:59:46.034
(However,)

1570
00:59:46.034 --> 00:59:47.034
(it dashes away.)

1571
00:59:48.804 --> 00:59:51.275
(His ordeal continues even in the water as well as on land.)

1572
00:59:52.545 --> 00:59:54.244
(It's difficult to hunt in shallow water.)

1573
00:59:54.244 --> 00:59:56.875
(Three of them go farther away from the shore.)

1574
00:59:58.784 --> 01:00:00.545
(They are heading somewhere.)

1575
01:00:00.545 --> 01:00:04.154
(What is waiting for them there?)

1576
01:00:05.324 --> 01:00:06.755
(Can I find something here?)

1577
01:00:07.695 --> 01:00:10.925
(Yun Hyeong moves more aggressively.)

1578
01:00:18.134 --> 01:00:20.565
(It seems Kang Nam found something as well.)

1579
01:00:22.835 --> 01:00:25.145
(What is this?)

1580
01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:28.045
(At the end where Kang Nam points at,)

1581
01:00:28.045 --> 01:00:29.614
(they vaguely see a cave.)

1582
01:00:29.614 --> 01:00:32.145
When I went to that side, I found a cave.

1583
01:00:33.815 --> 01:00:35.315
I could spot the cave...

1584
01:00:35.684 --> 01:00:38.925
because I saw blue lights from there due to the sunlight.

1585
01:00:39.554 --> 01:00:41.824
When I saw it, it was just so beautiful.

1586
01:00:44.025 --> 01:00:45.764
(Shall I go in first?)

1587
01:00:45.764 --> 01:00:48.165
(He takes a deep breath...)

1588
01:00:48.165 --> 01:00:51.304
(and goes in with his arms open wide.)

1589
01:00:51.304 --> 01:00:53.665
(It's a trip to a special place in the sea.)

1590
01:00:55.675 --> 01:00:58.574
I felt like I saw an exhibition.

1591
01:00:59.175 --> 01:01:01.775
The cave the nature created...

1592
01:01:02.315 --> 01:01:03.574
was spectacular.

1593
01:01:05.085 --> 01:01:07.384
(Kang Nam passes through the bridge.)

1594
01:01:07.384 --> 01:01:10.085
I was ecstatic when I swam into the blue light.

1595
01:01:10.585 --> 01:01:12.224
I could forget about everything in there.

1596
01:01:13.855 --> 01:01:14.855
(It's only possible in the Garden of the Spirits.)

1597
01:01:14.855 --> 01:01:15.855
It was great.

1598
01:01:15.855 --> 01:01:19.925
(They get a chance to relax only in the Garden of the Spirits.)

1599
01:01:21.665 --> 01:01:22.764
(He's impressed.)

1600
01:01:22.764 --> 01:01:23.864
This is amazing.

1601
01:01:25.465 --> 01:01:28.304
Mook Sik, do you want to see this? It's phenomenal.

1602
01:01:29.074 --> 01:01:30.945
(I must see it too.)

1603
01:01:33.244 --> 01:01:36.915
(It was formed by wave erosion,)

1604
01:01:36.915 --> 01:01:40.585
(but it's submerged now due to the increased sea level.)

1605
01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:43.614
I didn't know such place existed. It was very beautiful.

1606
01:01:43.815 --> 01:01:46.284
I wanted to see this topographic feature more.

1607
01:01:46.284 --> 01:01:47.654
I was very intrigued by it.

1608
01:01:50.154 --> 01:01:51.565
I thought it was interesting.

1609
01:01:52.465 --> 01:01:54.534
I wondered how the one on land and the one in the sea...

1610
01:01:54.534 --> 01:01:56.534
could resemble each other and be so close to each other.

1611
01:01:56.534 --> 01:01:57.965
They look really similar.

1612
01:01:57.965 --> 01:01:59.565
(It's as if he was in a dream.)

1613
01:02:02.275 --> 01:02:04.775
(The trio finishes exploring the sea.)

1614
01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:08.275
(He takes some things out.)

1615
01:02:08.645 --> 01:02:09.675
Did you get anything?

1616
01:02:09.675 --> 01:02:10.675
(They take out food they obtained.)

1617
01:02:12.784 --> 01:02:13.884
Let's put them in the chicken.

1618
01:02:16.085 --> 01:02:18.585
The dish will be perfectly seasoned...

1619
01:02:18.585 --> 01:02:20.085
when we put these in the soup.

1620
01:02:21.054 --> 01:02:23.395
(Look forward to the first chicken and seafood soup of the show.)

1621
01:02:24.594 --> 01:02:26.025
Welcome back.

1622
01:02:26.025 --> 01:02:27.994
- We're back. - You're back.

1623
01:02:28.534 --> 01:02:30.134
- The locals cleaned it for you. - Did they clean it for us?

1624
01:02:30.134 --> 01:02:31.965
- Yes. - Okay.

1625
01:02:32.565 --> 01:02:34.034
- Okay. Bring it here. - My goodness!

1626
01:02:34.875 --> 01:02:36.474
- Look at this. - This is big.

1627
01:02:36.474 --> 01:02:37.474
How huge.

1628
01:02:37.474 --> 01:02:39.045
(It's clean and neat.)

1629
01:02:39.045 --> 01:02:40.675
- That looks tasty. - They did an awesome job.

1630
01:02:40.675 --> 01:02:43.315
- This looks very good. - That does look very delicious.

1631
01:02:43.315 --> 01:02:45.344
- We need to make soup with it. - Exactly.

1632
01:02:45.545 --> 01:02:46.985
- Let's put it in. - All right.

1633
01:02:46.985 --> 01:02:48.255
(The pot heads straight to the fire.)

1634
01:02:48.255 --> 01:02:49.355
He said not to come yet.

1635
01:02:49.355 --> 01:02:51.625
- I bet it's going to be tasty. - I'm hungry.

1636
01:02:51.925 --> 01:02:53.154
You said you're going to cook, Yun Hyeong.

1637
01:02:53.154 --> 01:02:55.554
Right. I...

1638
01:02:56.255 --> 01:03:00.465
My goal of this trip was cooking a delicious meal for the Tribe.

1639
01:03:00.465 --> 01:03:01.565
That's right.

1640
01:03:01.565 --> 01:03:02.965
- He's going to cook at last. - I'll cook chicken soup.

1641
01:03:02.965 --> 01:03:04.364
- Chicken soup? - Yes, I'll cook chicken soup.

1642
01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:07.304
- I'll look forward to it. - Good luck.

1643
01:03:08.974 --> 01:03:12.204
My nickname among members of my group is Chef Song.

1644
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:15.844
I like to cook and I'm happy...

1645
01:03:15.844 --> 01:03:18.545
when I see people enjoying my food. It makes me happier.

1646
01:03:18.715 --> 01:03:21.755
I want to cook a delicious meal...

1647
01:03:21.884 --> 01:03:23.755
for the Tribe.

1648
01:03:25.154 --> 01:03:27.695
I'm planning to make natural seasoning...

1649
01:03:27.695 --> 01:03:29.895
which explains why I'm shooting this all of a sudden.

1650
01:03:30.255 --> 01:03:35.165
These are dried kelps, shiitake mushrooms, shrimps, and anchovies.

1651
01:03:35.695 --> 01:03:39.235
I heard guys who know how to cook are considered sexy these days.

1652
01:03:40.505 --> 01:03:41.574
I did it.

1653
01:03:42.304 --> 01:03:43.304
(He roasted and ground them into powder.)

1654
01:03:43.574 --> 01:03:46.574
I finished making my own natural seasoning.

1655
01:03:47.675 --> 01:03:48.974
(He takes out the seasoning.)

1656
01:03:48.974 --> 01:03:50.675
You can see that these aren't store-bought seasonings.

1657
01:03:50.675 --> 01:03:53.315
Since the rule is for you to be self-sufficient,

1658
01:03:53.315 --> 01:03:55.614
you cannot use the food you brought from Korea.

1659
01:03:55.614 --> 01:03:57.824
- Give us a break. - Can you let us use it this once?

1660
01:03:58.025 --> 01:04:00.554
I dried, roasted, and ground them into powder...

1661
01:04:00.554 --> 01:04:02.125
- all by myself. - He even dried shiitake.

1662
01:04:02.355 --> 01:04:04.025
I think you should allow us to use natural seasonings.

1663
01:04:04.025 --> 01:04:08.364
But I saw from a previous episode that Se Jeong brought...

1664
01:04:08.434 --> 01:04:11.934
- seasonings from her mom. - She got them from her mom.

1665
01:04:11.934 --> 01:04:14.404
- That was from her mom. - I saw the episode and made these.

1666
01:04:14.505 --> 01:04:16.404
Director, what's your ruling? Give us a definite ruling.

1667
01:04:16.404 --> 01:04:17.704
What if I showed you a special skill?

1668
01:04:18.145 --> 01:04:19.704
Will you let us use them?

1669
01:04:19.804 --> 01:04:21.514
- What will you show us? - Show him.

1670
01:04:21.514 --> 01:04:23.074
- I'll dance. - You're going to dance?

1671
01:04:23.074 --> 01:04:25.085
I wanted to dance with Bo Mi.

1672
01:04:25.085 --> 01:04:26.884
- Me? - That's right.

1673
01:04:26.884 --> 01:04:28.184
- Why me? - All of a sudden?

1674
01:04:28.485 --> 01:04:30.684
I saw Bo Mi...

1675
01:04:31.654 --> 01:04:35.255
(Apink uploaded the video of Bo Mi dancing to iKON's "Rhythm Ta".)

1676
01:04:35.255 --> 01:04:38.764
(Bo Mi is extremely excited.)

1677
01:04:38.824 --> 01:04:40.264
Get into the rhythm.

1678
01:04:40.264 --> 01:04:43.434
(She starts dancing more aggressively.)

1679
01:04:43.434 --> 01:04:44.934
(Nam Joo makes an appearance.)

1680
01:04:44.934 --> 01:04:46.404
(They're going to dance to "Rhythm Ta" in the jungle?)

1681
01:04:46.704 --> 01:04:48.904
No, we won't dance to that song. It's too boring.

1682
01:04:48.974 --> 01:04:50.175
What else can we dance?

1683
01:04:50.404 --> 01:04:52.145
- We'll do whatever you can dance. - I don't know.

1684
01:04:52.445 --> 01:04:54.844
How about Psy's "New Face"?

1685
01:04:55.244 --> 01:04:56.775
(Na Eun appeared in the music video.)

1686
01:04:56.775 --> 01:04:57.884
(I knew you'd pick that one.)

1687
01:04:57.884 --> 01:04:59.384
- All right. - Yes!

1688
01:04:59.384 --> 01:05:01.614
(This is Bo Mi's version of "New Face", not Na Eun's.)

1689
01:05:01.614 --> 01:05:02.715
The seasonings are at stake.

1690
01:05:02.715 --> 01:05:04.454
Don't you want to taste the seasonings?

1691
01:05:04.454 --> 01:05:06.654
- We want to! - We want to!

1692
01:05:07.154 --> 01:05:08.855
All right. Start.

1693
01:05:10.224 --> 01:05:12.025
(They lighten up the atmosphere...)

1694
01:05:12.025 --> 01:05:13.864
(and bring up the excitement.)

1695
01:05:14.125 --> 01:05:15.264
(Shall we have a go at it?)

1696
01:05:15.264 --> 01:05:16.264
Dance!

1697
01:05:16.264 --> 01:05:18.565
(This is Yun Hyeong and Bo Mi's joint performance of "New Face".)

1698
01:05:22.034 --> 01:05:25.344
(This is Bo Mi's performance of "New Face" in 2017.)

1699
01:05:25.344 --> 01:05:28.275
(She's giving her all to this performance.)

1700
01:05:30.775 --> 01:05:31.784
Seasoning.

1701
01:05:31.784 --> 01:05:33.145
(Yes, I want some seasoning.)

1702
01:05:33.545 --> 01:05:35.315
Hey, Bo Mi is stealing his thunder.

1703
01:05:35.454 --> 01:05:37.054
- Bo Mi is outshining him. - Hey,

1704
01:05:37.054 --> 01:05:38.224
Bo Mi is nailing this.

1705
01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:41.554
(Give...)

1706
01:05:41.554 --> 01:05:43.395
(me...)

1707
01:05:43.395 --> 01:05:44.925
(the seasoning.)

1708
01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.494
- She's amazing. - She's something else for sure.

1709
01:05:47.494 --> 01:05:49.235
You have to let us use it now given their performance.

1710
01:05:49.465 --> 01:05:51.864
(They are fully satisfied.)

1711
01:05:52.965 --> 01:05:55.134
We will allow you to use the seasoning.

1712
01:05:55.134 --> 01:05:57.335
- Okay! - I'll allow it.

1713
01:05:58.045 --> 01:05:59.145
It's all thanks to you.

1714
01:05:59.974 --> 01:06:01.275
I thought she was going to explode.

1715
01:06:01.614 --> 01:06:03.445
- It's being cooked now. - What is that?

1716
01:06:03.445 --> 01:06:05.445
Hurry and put it in. We have to add it in advance.

1717
01:06:05.445 --> 01:06:06.485
No, no.

1718
01:06:06.485 --> 01:06:07.884
(Yun Hyeong's seasoning goes in.)

1719
01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:09.884
Are you going to put a lot? Are you?

1720
01:06:09.884 --> 01:06:12.585
If I put a lot of the seasoning, the chicken loses its natural taste.

1721
01:06:12.654 --> 01:06:15.025
- You'll put a moderate amount. - I'll put just enough.

1722
01:06:15.025 --> 01:06:18.695
I think I should put a bit more since everyone likes salty food.

1723
01:06:19.264 --> 01:06:20.395
- It will have a natural taste. - That's right.

1724
01:06:20.395 --> 01:06:21.835
A little bit of salt.

1725
01:06:21.835 --> 01:06:23.895
- We have ginger too. - We have ingredients.

1726
01:06:23.895 --> 01:06:25.804
- Spicy chili peppers. - Chili peppers and yams.

1727
01:06:25.804 --> 01:06:28.034
Don't talk when the youngest member is cooking.

1728
01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.145
- Chef. - Yun Hyeong, we believe in you.

1729
01:06:31.605 --> 01:06:33.744
Shall we put in the yam first?

1730
01:06:33.844 --> 01:06:36.445
- Bo Mi, please slice the yam. - Okay.

1731
01:06:36.844 --> 01:06:39.884
(The assistants move hurriedly.)

1732
01:06:40.855 --> 01:06:43.554
(They add yams instead of potatoes.)

1733
01:06:44.255 --> 01:06:46.255
Please mince a bit of ginger.

1734
01:06:46.255 --> 01:06:48.025
- Mince it? - How much should I mince?

1735
01:06:48.025 --> 01:06:49.054
- Yes. - How much should I mince?

1736
01:06:49.425 --> 01:06:50.994
I have a certain style I use.

1737
01:06:50.994 --> 01:06:52.864
In that case...

1738
01:06:52.864 --> 01:06:54.434
- What should I do? - She minces the ginger well.

1739
01:06:54.434 --> 01:06:55.965
(Hitting)

1740
01:06:55.965 --> 01:06:56.965
She is holding it with her hands.

1741
01:06:57.065 --> 01:06:59.034
- How can she do it so well? - My goodness.

1742
01:06:59.204 --> 01:07:01.574
- Ginger. - Add all of it.

1743
01:07:01.574 --> 01:07:03.934
(Ginger goes into the pot to eliminate the gamey taste.)

1744
01:07:04.505 --> 01:07:05.875
- What should we do now? - Chili peppers.

1745
01:07:05.875 --> 01:07:06.875
Shall we slice chili peppers?

1746
01:07:07.404 --> 01:07:08.614
I will add chili peppers later.

1747
01:07:09.114 --> 01:07:10.715
Adding them now will ruin the mouthfeel.

1748
01:07:11.244 --> 01:07:13.445
Cooking them for too long makes them mushy.

1749
01:07:13.445 --> 01:07:16.014
Is there a reason why you add certain ingredients first?

1750
01:07:16.014 --> 01:07:19.525
I personally add hard ingredients first.

1751
01:07:20.485 --> 01:07:23.925
That would be vegetables such as carrots and potatoes.

1752
01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:27.795
Then come the softer ingredients.

1753
01:07:28.264 --> 01:07:30.394
He is cool. Men who know how to cook are sexy.

1754
01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:31.404
Should I slice chili peppers?

1755
01:07:31.805 --> 01:07:33.805
- Yes, please slice them. - I will slice them.

1756
01:07:33.805 --> 01:07:35.805
We don't have chopsticks and spoons.

1757
01:07:36.675 --> 01:07:37.704
Let's make them.

1758
01:07:38.345 --> 01:07:39.975
- We can add chili peppers now. - Chili peppers?

1759
01:07:40.345 --> 01:07:41.715
- Here are chili peppers. - Please add two.

1760
01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.045
(Spicy chili peppers are added towards the end.)

1761
01:07:44.045 --> 01:07:45.515
All right.

1762
01:07:45.515 --> 01:07:47.984
- Are we not adding this? - Chef.

1763
01:07:48.255 --> 01:07:49.354
Should I add this right away?

1764
01:07:49.685 --> 01:07:50.925
All right, let's try it.

1765
01:07:50.925 --> 01:07:51.954
(Let's try it.)

1766
01:07:51.954 --> 01:07:54.324
- It's hot. - My goodness.

1767
01:07:54.954 --> 01:07:57.154
(What does Yun Hyeong think?)

1768
01:07:58.994 --> 01:08:00.194
It's nice.

1769
01:08:00.194 --> 01:08:01.935
It's good to my taste, but we can add more salt.

1770
01:08:02.994 --> 01:08:05.965
We can add these anytime.

1771
01:08:05.965 --> 01:08:07.574
(With the seafood, the dish becomes Haeshintang.)

1772
01:08:07.774 --> 01:08:09.534
What do you need next?

1773
01:08:10.335 --> 01:08:12.074
- We need to wait now. - Is the cooking process over?

1774
01:08:12.074 --> 01:08:13.604
- Yes. - Is the cooking process over?

1775
01:08:13.904 --> 01:08:15.675
Yes. There are no hard steps.

1776
01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:17.715
It looks like a proper dish.

1777
01:08:17.915 --> 01:08:20.284
- 5 minutes. - 5 minutes?

1778
01:08:20.284 --> 01:08:21.314
(Yun Hyeong, we believe in you.)

1779
01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:22.715
- 5 minutes. - I am hungry now.

1780
01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:24.685
I think it's ready.

1781
01:08:25.085 --> 01:08:26.125
The dish is ready.

1782
01:08:26.824 --> 01:08:27.824
It's cooked nicely.

1783
01:08:29.055 --> 01:08:30.055
Is it ready?

1784
01:08:31.324 --> 01:08:33.394
- It looks tasty. - It looks tasty.

1785
01:08:33.394 --> 01:08:34.665
(Amidst the soup lies a chicken that has absorbed the seasoning.)

1786
01:08:34.894 --> 01:08:36.894
- You get this at a restaurant. - It looks delicious.

1787
01:08:36.894 --> 01:08:37.965
(You rarely get a dish that looks so tasty in the jungle.)

1788
01:08:37.965 --> 01:08:39.534
- It looks delicious. - Is it cooked already?

1789
01:08:40.005 --> 01:08:41.435
It looks delicious.

1790
01:08:41.435 --> 01:08:42.604
(He can't take his eyes off the dish.)

1791
01:08:42.604 --> 01:08:43.935
(I hope it's tasty.)

1792
01:08:43.935 --> 01:08:46.375
- Look at the color of the soup. - May I try the soup?

1793
01:08:46.904 --> 01:08:48.045
- It's spicy. - Me too.

1794
01:08:48.314 --> 01:08:50.415
We added a lot of chili peppers.

1795
01:08:50.415 --> 01:08:51.644
We should have added one.

1796
01:08:51.644 --> 01:08:54.314
They sliced a lot of chili peppers.

1797
01:08:54.814 --> 01:08:55.854
Yun Hyeong told us to add two.

1798
01:08:55.854 --> 01:08:57.625
(She reacts like a middle-aged man.)

1799
01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:58.685
Really?

1800
01:08:59.555 --> 01:09:02.425
- It's so tasty. - She gave the best reaction.

1801
01:09:02.795 --> 01:09:05.095
- Let's cut the chicken. - It's so tasty.

1802
01:09:05.795 --> 01:09:07.494
It's so tasty.

1803
01:09:08.835 --> 01:09:11.435
- I like that it's spicy. - The soup is rich.

1804
01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:12.935
Would you like some soup?

1805
01:09:13.835 --> 01:09:15.135
It looks delicious.

1806
01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:17.305
The soup is rich.

1807
01:09:17.305 --> 01:09:18.305
(My goodness.)

1808
01:09:18.305 --> 01:09:19.345
- The meat is firm. - It's delicious.

1809
01:09:20.074 --> 01:09:21.274
The soup is thick.

1810
01:09:22.345 --> 01:09:24.015
- Maybe it's because we added yams. - It's really delicious.

1811
01:09:24.015 --> 01:09:25.915
The soup turned thick because of yams.

1812
01:09:25.915 --> 01:09:28.415
- It's very spicy. - I like that it's spicy.

1813
01:09:28.415 --> 01:09:30.854
- It looks like makgeolli. - It looks like a dumpling.

1814
01:09:30.854 --> 01:09:32.354
The ladle suits you.

1815
01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:35.055
- This is a hangover soup. - It's nice.

1816
01:09:35.524 --> 01:09:37.994
It reminds me of soup that contains wild sesame seeds.

1817
01:09:37.994 --> 01:09:39.925
It's tasty.

1818
01:09:40.024 --> 01:09:43.064
The chef should tear the meat in a tasty way.

1819
01:09:43.465 --> 01:09:44.904
(Yun Hyeong tears the meat.)

1820
01:09:44.904 --> 01:09:45.935
My goodness.

1821
01:09:46.635 --> 01:09:47.774
(He can't tear it easily.)

1822
01:09:47.774 --> 01:09:49.204
- It looks delicious. - It looks delicious.

1823
01:09:49.204 --> 01:09:50.875
(The wild chicken has overly tough meat.)

1824
01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:52.204
- My goodness. - Is it tough?

1825
01:09:52.204 --> 01:09:53.274
It's too firm.

1826
01:09:54.314 --> 01:09:55.475
It looks like it's tough.

1827
01:09:56.215 --> 01:09:58.915
- It's wild chicken. - It looks delicious.

1828
01:09:58.915 --> 01:10:00.085
Here is a chicken leg.

1829
01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:02.614
- Pass it down. - It's really tasty.

1830
01:10:02.614 --> 01:10:04.784
- A chicken leg. - Moon Sik, you should eat it.

1831
01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:06.585
- Moon Sik. - The oldest member should eat it.

1832
01:10:06.585 --> 01:10:08.394
You worked hard as the assistant.

1833
01:10:08.394 --> 01:10:10.324
Was I an assistant?

1834
01:10:10.625 --> 01:10:13.494
- An assistant who is like chef. - You called yourself an assistant.

1835
01:10:15.765 --> 01:10:17.034
(He takes a big bite.)

1836
01:10:17.034 --> 01:10:18.064
Is it spicy?

1837
01:10:18.265 --> 01:10:19.435
It's spicy, but tasty.

1838
01:10:19.435 --> 01:10:20.534
(Savoring)

1839
01:10:20.534 --> 01:10:21.875
The chicken is too skinny.

1840
01:10:21.875 --> 01:10:22.904
(It can't be helped since it's a wild chicken.)

1841
01:10:24.274 --> 01:10:25.545
The chewiness is just right.

1842
01:10:25.545 --> 01:10:26.675
(The wild chicken is chewy.)

1843
01:10:26.675 --> 01:10:27.744
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

1844
01:10:28.144 --> 01:10:30.274
- While it's a bit tough... - You seasoned it well.

1845
01:10:31.915 --> 01:10:33.915
(Even though I made it, it's very tasty.)

1846
01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:36.314
The meat is tasty.

1847
01:10:37.354 --> 01:10:38.425
This is incredible.

1848
01:10:39.055 --> 01:10:40.784
Let's dip the meat here.

1849
01:10:40.784 --> 01:10:42.055
(Tae Gon takes a big bite.)

1850
01:10:42.055 --> 01:10:43.055
(His eyes become bigger.)

1851
01:10:43.055 --> 01:10:44.864
My goodness, the meat is different.

1852
01:10:45.864 --> 01:10:47.194
- It's not too tough. - It's not tough.

1853
01:10:47.194 --> 01:10:48.465
It's not tough.

1854
01:10:48.465 --> 01:10:51.435
- It's not tough, but chewy. - You're right.

1855
01:10:52.904 --> 01:10:53.965
(They share the chicken leg.)

1856
01:10:54.704 --> 01:10:56.475
(She tears it powerfully.)

1857
01:10:56.475 --> 01:10:58.574
- It's really tasty. - It's a bit tough,

1858
01:10:58.574 --> 01:11:00.444
- but also chewy. - It's tough in a tasty way.

1859
01:11:00.574 --> 01:11:02.515
- It's tough in a tasty way. - It must be chewy.

1860
01:11:02.515 --> 01:11:04.345
(Cho Rong focuses on eating.)

1861
01:11:04.345 --> 01:11:05.415
Right?

1862
01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:07.415
Right?

1863
01:11:07.415 --> 01:11:09.915
This is like Health Food Special.

1864
01:11:10.284 --> 01:11:11.454
- You cooked. - Yes.

1865
01:11:11.625 --> 01:11:12.784
Please give me chicken breast.

1866
01:11:12.784 --> 01:11:13.854
- Chicken breast. - Yes.

1867
01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:16.324
- Yun Hyeong's dish is popular. - This is incredible.

1868
01:11:16.324 --> 01:11:17.354
It's popular.

1869
01:11:17.595 --> 01:11:19.564
(They cut the chicken breast...)

1870
01:11:19.564 --> 01:11:20.965
It looks delicious.

1871
01:11:20.965 --> 01:11:23.095
(and deliver it to the customers.)

1872
01:11:23.095 --> 01:11:25.135
I can't believe I am eating chicken breast in the jungle.

1873
01:11:25.765 --> 01:11:27.435
- I am sorry. - It can't be helped.

1874
01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:29.074
My goodness.

1875
01:11:30.875 --> 01:11:32.805
It's the right amount of toughness.

1876
01:11:32.805 --> 01:11:35.114
- That's right. - The toughness is consistent.

1877
01:11:35.475 --> 01:11:37.614
- It's chewy. - It's chewy.

1878
01:11:37.614 --> 01:11:38.744
It's chewy.

1879
01:11:38.744 --> 01:11:40.314
I will try the yam.

1880
01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:44.354
- Yam. - Dip it in the soup.

1881
01:11:44.555 --> 01:11:47.755
- It will be nice. - It tastes like potato.

1882
01:11:49.024 --> 01:11:52.364
(Yam acts as potato in the chicken dish.)

1883
01:11:52.364 --> 01:11:54.665
- It tastes like potato. - It tastes like potato.

1884
01:11:54.665 --> 01:11:56.994
- A potato in the refrigerator. - It really tastes like potato.

1885
01:11:57.765 --> 01:11:59.534
- It's tasty. - It really tastes like potato.

1886
01:11:59.534 --> 01:12:00.564
Yes.

1887
01:12:00.765 --> 01:12:03.005
- Yun Hyeong, it's tasty. - It's a bit like taro soup.

1888
01:12:03.005 --> 01:12:05.204
- Yun Hyeong, it's really tasty. - Thank you.

1889
01:12:05.805 --> 01:12:07.444
- I know. - We acknowledge your talent.

1890
01:12:07.814 --> 01:12:09.144
We ate a lot.

1891
01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:12.185
- I can't believe I ate spicy food. - It was tasty.

1892
01:12:13.144 --> 01:12:17.114
Thanks to the seasoning Yun Hyeong brought,

1893
01:12:17.114 --> 01:12:19.125
we enjoyed the dish.

1894
01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:22.324
I felt like I was eating health food. It was very tasty.

1895
01:12:22.725 --> 01:12:24.225
The soup was a work of art.

1896
01:12:24.824 --> 01:12:26.225
It was spicy.

1897
01:12:26.994 --> 01:12:30.095
We were lacking energy. It was exactly what we needed.

1898
01:12:30.734 --> 01:12:33.305
Thanks to the soup, everyone filled their stomachs.

1899
01:12:34.135 --> 01:12:36.505
I was thankful that everyone enjoyed the dish.

1900
01:12:37.234 --> 01:12:38.274
I was happy.

1901
01:12:38.774 --> 01:12:41.015
To be honest, I only ate a little bit.

1902
01:12:41.015 --> 01:12:42.015
I still felt full.

1903
01:12:43.244 --> 01:12:44.314
Yun Hyeong did a good job.

1904
01:12:44.715 --> 01:12:47.415
At the land of blessing, the Garden of the Spirits,

1905
01:12:47.415 --> 01:12:51.225
Byung Man's Tribe gains energy from Yun Hyeong's chicken dish.

1906
01:12:51.984 --> 01:12:55.324
What kind of adventures await them?

1907
01:12:56.755 --> 01:12:57.824
Next week.

1908
01:12:58.394 --> 01:13:00.024
(The real hunt begins now.)

1909
01:13:00.024 --> 01:13:02.064
(All veterans go on a hunt.)

1910
01:13:02.064 --> 01:13:03.665
(The youngest member catches fish as well.)

1911
01:13:03.665 --> 01:13:05.835
(Cho Rong and Bo Mi never stop eating.)

1912
01:13:05.835 --> 01:13:07.875
(What is the special food with an incredible taste?)

1913
01:13:07.875 --> 01:13:09.505
(Also)

1914
01:13:09.505 --> 01:13:11.074
(She shows off her vocal cords.)

1915
01:13:11.074 --> 01:13:13.074
(She makes the others feel embarrassed.)

1916
01:13:13.074 --> 01:13:15.515
(They make a theme song for The Law of Jungle.)

1917
01:13:15.515 --> 01:13:17.274
(The Law of Jungle in the Garden of the Spirits)

1918
01:13:17.274 --> 01:13:19.715
(Who is this man with the familiar silhouette?)

1919
01:13:19.715 --> 01:13:22.415
(This episode will air 2 weeks later.)

1920
01:13:22.415 --> 01:13:25.255
(It has been a while.)

1921
01:13:26.625 --> 01:13:28.654
(He is back.)

1922
01:13:30.425 --> 01:13:33.265
(The Law of Jungle in the Cook Islands)

1923
01:13:33.265 --> 01:13:38.204
(Chief Byung Man is back.)

1924
01:13:38.204 --> 01:13:39.765
(I will get to work now.)

1925

(The Law of Jungle in the Cook Islands)
