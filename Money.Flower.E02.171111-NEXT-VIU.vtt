(The products and organizations have been created for the drama.)

2
00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.398
(The story and its characters are fictional.)

3
00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:17.408
Run.

4
00:00:17.408 --> 00:00:18.438
What?

5
00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:19.579
Go save the bird.

6
00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:27.949
My goodness!

7
00:00:29.818 --> 00:00:31.789
Are you all right? Excuse me.

8
00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.888
Put the bird in your hat, and hand it over to her.

9
00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:37.559
Don't forget to say you hope that the bird makes it.

10
00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.059
I'll take it from here.

11
00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:45.339
- Take this. - Pardon?

12
00:00:45.468 --> 00:00:47.138
Put the bird in here.

13
00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:48.169
Sorry?

14
00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.809
All right.

15
00:00:55.778 --> 00:00:56.809
Be careful.

16
00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:59.549
Where should I take it?

17
00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.318
That way.

18
00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:06.789
Wait.

19
00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:11.929
- Are you all right? - Yes.

20
00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:14.229
Hold my arm.

21
00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:27.278
(Episode 2)

22
00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.849
What's taking so long?

23
00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:46.328
Luckily, the bullet just swerved. They need to treat it a bit more.

24
00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:50.669
- Thank you for your help. - My pleasure.

25
00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.709
Get out of there since you checked the bird is okay.

26
00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:06.048
What kind of a lunatic would shoot a bird? I have to catch that jerk.

27
00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:09.148
Yes, you must. What a lunatic.

28
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.159
Right.

29
00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:14.428
He's probably gone, right?

30
00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.159
My goodness.

31
00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.499
Your pants... Please hold on.

32
00:02:29.638 --> 00:02:32.539
This is the blanket I use for emergency.

33
00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.919
You might catch a cold. So why don't you...

34
00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:42.148
- wrap this around your body? - Okay.

35
00:02:46.018 --> 00:02:47.058
Do I look weird?

36
00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:51.199
A bit? You look weird just a bit.

37
00:02:51.898 --> 00:02:54.898
But still. It's much better than catching a cold.

38
00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:58.539
Wait.

39
00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:08.808
You don't have to return the blanket.

40
00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:13.148
Your hat.

41
00:03:15.048 --> 00:03:16.088
Wait.

42
00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.558
Shoot.

43
00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.858
Darn.

44
00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:27.898
Hey, you!

45
00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.069
I got it.

46
00:03:32.238 --> 00:03:33.599
Use your words.

47
00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.009
Don't curse with your eyes.

48
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.138
I guess you can hear me loud and clear.

49
00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:38.979
I can hear you all the way here.

50
00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:53.518
I'm wearing a skirt.

51
00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.768
Hey, you know nothing about women.

52
00:04:07.338 --> 00:04:08.838
Business regarding Cheong A Group,

53
00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:11.078
accurate shooting that only hurts the feathers,

54
00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:13.409
studying, winning Mom over,

55
00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:16.009
and flattering Secretary Oh and Ms. Icheon.

56
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.448
You're better at these things than me, but I know women better.

57
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.618
I know women better than you.

58
00:04:22.688 --> 00:04:24.558
What good would disappearing do after rescuing the bird?

59
00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:26.159
I must get things going.

60
00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.229
The woman you're going to marry...

61
00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:31.899
isn't some woman.

62
00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.068
She's Na Mo Hyun.

63
00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.169
Fine.

64
00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.738
I got it. She's not just some woman. She's Na Mo Hyun.

65
00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.479
That's why I'm letting you scold me.

66
00:04:48.508 --> 00:04:51.378
You're going to drive. I'm tired.

67
00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:53.988
I jumped into the water to save the bird. Why are you tired?

68
00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.329
Oh, right. Na Mo Hyun said...

69
00:05:06.758 --> 00:05:08.669
she's going to catch...

70
00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:11.068
the lunatic who shot the bird.

71
00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.899
It's legal to hunt that particular kind of birds.

72
00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:14.209
Of course it is.

73
00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.308
But if you're going to shoot something next, tell me in advance.

74
00:05:17.308 --> 00:05:19.079
If you have prior knowledge, you'll look unnatural.

75
00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.948
It must look natural.

76
00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.289
Why does she come here to watch birds?

77
00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:34.628
They're going to come and leave anyway.

78
00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:40.698
If the migratory birds return,

79
00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:44.198
that's evidence that the environment hasn't contaminated yet.

80
00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:45.938
She's just happy to see them.

81
00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:47.709
She's happy.

82
00:05:48.068 --> 00:05:49.808
That's why she keeps going around to watch them.

83
00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.738
She pretends that she knows the birds...

84
00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:55.748
to make her feel better.

85
00:05:58.618 --> 00:06:01.519
Kang Pil Joo, you've been studying.

86
00:06:02.618 --> 00:06:04.089
I should be the one studying though.

87
00:06:15.298 --> 00:06:17.938
Hey, get rid of your women.

88
00:06:17.938 --> 00:06:20.139
What? Women?

89
00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:24.409
The problem is that you don't take me seriously.

90
00:06:24.508 --> 00:06:25.508
I'm not dating anyone.

91
00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.149
Was there a time I kept a secret from you?

92
00:06:28.948 --> 00:06:30.818
Yes, I did that once. A long ago.

93
00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:34.219
But I came clean about that, and I'll tell you everything.

94
00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:36.248
Should you really tell me everything in the future?

95
00:06:36.818 --> 00:06:37.959
I already know.

96
00:06:38.988 --> 00:06:41.258
- I know about Na Mo Hyun. - Right.

97
00:06:41.858 --> 00:06:43.058
Without her,

98
00:06:43.688 --> 00:06:44.899
you will never...

99
00:06:45.698 --> 00:06:47.329
be able to win against Jang Yuh Cheon.

100
00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:49.099
Never.

101
00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:50.839
I can love Na Mo Hyun...

102
00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:54.409
and other women as well.

103
00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:56.808
I'm confident I can pull it off.

104
00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:01.678
There you go again with your eyes.

105
00:07:02.048 --> 00:07:03.678
I was just joking.

106
00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:05.448
Just hit me.

107
00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:08.248
Punch me, so you can feel better...

108
00:07:08.448 --> 00:07:10.389
and help me get married. Please?

109
00:07:12.488 --> 00:07:13.488
But Pil Joo,

110
00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:16.959
you don't think a single woman will be able to make me happy...

111
00:07:17.258 --> 00:07:19.599
happy for the rest of my life, do you?

112
00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:30.639
Did you really just punch me?

113
00:07:37.618 --> 00:07:39.519
You moron!

114
00:07:45.688 --> 00:07:46.889
You're driving.

115
00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:04.779
That crazy jerk. Hey!

116
00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:07.008
Hey, I'm going to kill you! Hey!

117
00:08:25.198 --> 00:08:26.229
Welcome back.

118
00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:31.899
Oh, this?

119
00:08:33.438 --> 00:08:34.438
I...

120
00:08:36.838 --> 00:08:38.938
I fell when I was chasing after some girl.

121
00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.749
Pil Joo can fill in the rest.

122
00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:53.619
Go easy on him.

123
00:08:53.688 --> 00:08:55.958
- It looked like he bled a lot. - He said he fell.

124
00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:01.568
He's going around to watch the migratory birds?

125
00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:04.169
That's the report I received.

126
00:09:06.468 --> 00:09:10.269
Pil Joo always has an agenda when he does something.

127
00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:13.808
But he's watching birds?

128
00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:15.409
Dad.

129
00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:18.779
I didn't know Mr. Woo was with you.

130
00:09:21.348 --> 00:09:22.989
From now on, go to your grandfather's house, Mooshimwon,

131
00:09:23.289 --> 00:09:24.718
and have breakfast before going to work.

132
00:09:24.859 --> 00:09:26.159
With Grandfather?

133
00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.859
It's going to take more than 30 minutes for me to get there.

134
00:09:31.198 --> 00:09:32.428
I'll do that, sir.

135
00:09:35.228 --> 00:09:36.228
Here.

136
00:09:38.838 --> 00:09:40.039
What is this?

137
00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:42.539
You can't go empty-handed to your grandfather's house.

138
00:09:42.909 --> 00:09:44.509
This is the article for tomorrow's morning paper.

139
00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:46.739
- Show that to him. - Yes, sir.

140
00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:51.879
(President Jang Seong Man)

141
00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:06.629
That would be...

142
00:10:07.228 --> 00:10:09.399
enough for their first encounter.

143
00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:13.369
So what's your plan?

144
00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:16.769
I'm going to make Boo Cheon cross paths with Na Mo Hyun.

145
00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:19.808
It will be done slowly and seen as a coincidence.

146
00:10:21.109 --> 00:10:23.978
His ties to Cheong A Group will be concealed completely.

147
00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:25.218
To get married,

148
00:10:26.078 --> 00:10:28.718
they must be aware of his connections to Cheong A Group.

149
00:10:28.718 --> 00:10:30.759
Once she truly loves Boo Cheon,

150
00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:32.218
she will forgive him.

151
00:10:32.259 --> 00:10:33.828
Love will earn her forgiveness?

152
00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.328
Yes. That's the kind of a woman Na Mo Hyun is.

153
00:10:37.558 --> 00:10:40.328
She won't forgive him when Boo Cheon is to inherit the company?

154
00:10:40.468 --> 00:10:42.899
She hates the riches.

155
00:10:43.968 --> 00:10:47.438
That's why I'm going to hide it until she truly...

156
00:10:47.838 --> 00:10:48.938
loves Bu Cheon.

157
00:10:48.968 --> 00:10:51.779
She sounds worse than a foolish girl who's still wet behind her ears.

158
00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:54.009
I'm worried...

159
00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:57.818
to accept her as my daughter-in-law...

160
00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:03.389
and make her as one of my people.

161
00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:23.739
(Schedule)

162
00:11:31.318 --> 00:11:35.088
(Na Mo Hyun schedule)

163
00:11:56.169 --> 00:11:58.039
The place in this picture.

164
00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:01.609
Isn't that your old house?

165
00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:06.919
Na Mo Hyun posted this photo...

166
00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:09.218
on the website that she and her friends...

167
00:12:09.218 --> 00:12:11.619
talk about the loves of their lives.

168
00:12:12.058 --> 00:12:13.588
She posted that picture on it.

169
00:12:15.289 --> 00:12:16.289
Here.

170
00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:19.659
Who is Jo In Ho?

171
00:12:29.169 --> 00:12:32.539
(Jo In Ho)

172
00:12:35.578 --> 00:12:37.318
The book belongs to Jo In Ho.

173
00:12:37.749 --> 00:12:38.879
My father...

174
00:12:39.749 --> 00:12:42.019
bought that book for her from your junk shop...

175
00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:43.048
for her to study.

176
00:12:44.718 --> 00:12:47.159
I burnt everything before I left.

177
00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:50.928
She thinks you're Jo In Ho.

178
00:12:51.428 --> 00:12:52.428
Hold on.

179
00:12:52.859 --> 00:12:53.869
Does that mean...

180
00:12:54.828 --> 00:12:56.728
you're her first love?

181
00:12:57.438 --> 00:12:58.499
What about you?

182
00:12:58.938 --> 00:13:00.509
Is she your first love?

183
00:13:00.838 --> 00:13:02.509
I didn't even know her name.

184
00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:05.578
Na Mo Hyun.

185
00:13:08.048 --> 00:13:09.149
Na Mo Hyun.

186
00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:12.649
There must be a reason for her to visit your old house...

187
00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:14.749
and take a picture with the only book left?

188
00:13:16.548 --> 00:13:17.619
There's no such thing.

189
00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:46.879
I'm sorry...

190
00:13:47.548 --> 00:13:49.848
for being a bad father.

191
00:13:51.588 --> 00:13:54.088
I know you didn't do that,

192
00:13:55.789 --> 00:13:57.259
but I can't help you.

193
00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:05.068
I'm so angry...

194
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:08.808
that I can't even sleep.

195
00:14:08.838 --> 00:14:09.909
Father.

196
00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:13.438
Don't come here. Go to the hospital. Okay?

197
00:14:13.948 --> 00:14:15.948
Tell them to help you on credit,

198
00:14:15.978 --> 00:14:17.978
and I'll pay them back...

199
00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:19.948
once I get out of here.

200
00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:21.948
Okay, Father?

201
00:18:10.748 --> 00:18:13.419
21, 22, 23, 24, 25,

202
00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:16.089
26, 27, 28, 29, 30...

203
00:18:16.089 --> 00:18:19.258
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

204
00:18:29.169 --> 00:18:31.768
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

205
00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:44.319
What are you doing?

206
00:18:46.579 --> 00:18:48.119
No!

207
00:18:50.988 --> 00:18:52.288
What's wrong?

208
00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:54.488
Why would you try to die?

209
00:18:57.059 --> 00:18:59.829
It's scary.

210
00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:46.379
Mo Hyun.

211
00:19:48.278 --> 00:19:49.349
Mom.

212
00:19:50.478 --> 00:19:52.419
What are you doing here?

213
00:19:52.678 --> 00:19:54.448
I'm waiting for my partner.

214
00:19:54.589 --> 00:19:56.488
My partner's been very lonely.

215
00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:00.488
The house is right there. Why would you wait here?

216
00:20:03.389 --> 00:20:06.129
Are you going to run to Dad...

217
00:20:06.758 --> 00:20:07.928
once he gets off the car?

218
00:20:07.968 --> 00:20:09.129
No.

219
00:20:09.899 --> 00:20:12.268
I'm going to watch him...

220
00:20:12.268 --> 00:20:14.738
walk up the stairs and hug him.

221
00:20:16.369 --> 00:20:17.438
Goodness.

222
00:20:17.708 --> 00:20:21.879
I don't know how you still love each other so much.

223
00:20:21.879 --> 00:20:23.778
I envy you.

224
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:25.349
Don't.

225
00:20:25.678 --> 00:20:28.149
The person whom you bought the steak...

226
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:30.419
No. It's over.

227
00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:32.059
Is it because of Jo In Ho?

228
00:20:32.119 --> 00:20:34.488
Do you think I'm still in middle school?

229
00:20:35.258 --> 00:20:37.159
That's so long ago.

230
00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:40.428
You said you told the professor's nephew about him.

231
00:20:40.428 --> 00:20:43.099
I had no choice, but to talk about it...

232
00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:44.569
because I had nothing else to talk about.

233
00:20:44.569 --> 00:20:48.339
You two must have hit it off to talk about it.

234
00:20:49.038 --> 00:20:50.839
You said you're waiting for your partner.

235
00:20:51.139 --> 00:20:53.109
I'll come back after I make dinner for you.

236
00:20:53.978 --> 00:20:55.579
I can take care of myself.

237
00:20:56.978 --> 00:20:59.619
Mom, I can do it.

238
00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:00.819
Mom.

239
00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:13.399
(Jo In Ho)

240
00:21:16.768 --> 00:21:21.309
(Jo In Ho)

241
00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:37.659
I just...

242
00:21:39.258 --> 00:21:41.359
want to see...

243
00:21:41.988 --> 00:21:43.958
how he's doing.

244
00:21:46.458 --> 00:21:47.569
That's all.

245
00:22:02.409 --> 00:22:03.478
Mom.

246
00:22:06.678 --> 00:22:07.688
Mom.

247
00:22:08.649 --> 00:22:10.919
- Drop this at the dry cleaning. - Whose hat is this?

248
00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:13.829
Someone I'm very grateful for.

249
00:22:30.579 --> 00:22:31.938
What did I tell you?

250
00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:35.008
I said we'll catch up with Boo Cheon soon.

251
00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:38.319
- Hello. - Hey.

252
00:22:39.248 --> 00:22:41.988
Why is he with Grandfather?

253
00:22:43.349 --> 00:22:45.788
- I didn't know you were coming. - It's a surprise.

254
00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:47.958
What else would I do at home? It's better to come to work.

255
00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:50.528
Why would you come with Yuh Cheon when you have me...

256
00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:52.559
- and Attorney Jang? - That's...

257
00:22:52.629 --> 00:22:54.428
Yuh Cheon's surprise.

258
00:22:55.028 --> 00:22:57.369
You look very happy today, Grandfather.

259
00:22:58.639 --> 00:23:00.238
Don't you read the newspaper?

260
00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:13.149
("Bowon Residents Welcome Interchange Construction")

261
00:23:14.589 --> 00:23:17.518
I read the summary of articles Yuh Cheon gave me this morning,

262
00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:19.319
and I read it again on the newspaper here.

263
00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:21.859
The more I read about it, the happier I am.

264
00:23:23.288 --> 00:23:25.728
Show our gratitude to Hanmin Daily Chairman,

265
00:23:25.829 --> 00:23:28.299
- Seong Man. - Yes.

266
00:23:30.228 --> 00:23:32.538
Let me get a report from you. It's been a while.

267
00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:35.409
- Grandfather... - Be quiet.

268
00:23:36.069 --> 00:23:38.579
I have something to tell him. Just wait.

269
00:23:40.678 --> 00:23:41.678
Okay.

270
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:43.948
I rushed to make this.

271
00:23:57.099 --> 00:23:59.498
Father. It's me.

272
00:24:01.299 --> 00:24:02.329
Father?

273
00:24:06.268 --> 00:24:07.438
Go tell Ms. Han...

274
00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:09.508
to come.

275
00:24:09.768 --> 00:24:11.579
I think Father's in a deep sleep.

276
00:24:11.579 --> 00:24:13.008
There's no one in the kitchen.

277
00:24:19.278 --> 00:24:21.718
Sir, it's Secretary Ahn.

278
00:24:24.488 --> 00:24:26.059
Do you think something happened?

279
00:24:30.129 --> 00:24:32.028
What do you mean?

280
00:24:32.629 --> 00:24:35.028
He went to work after breakfast.

281
00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:37.839
Attorney Kang and Director Jang...

282
00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:40.169
didn't say anything about going to work with him.

283
00:24:40.369 --> 00:24:42.968
Director Jang Yuh Cheon accompanied him.

284
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:45.109
Goodness.

285
00:24:45.978 --> 00:24:50.008
Director Jang Yuh Cheon must have forgotten to say hello to you again.

286
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:52.678
I'll tell him to say hello tomorrow.

287
00:24:53.018 --> 00:24:55.649
Is Yuh Cheon coming again tomorrow?

288
00:24:55.788 --> 00:24:58.619
He said he'll have breakfast with Grandfather every day.

289
00:24:59.518 --> 00:25:02.528
Chairman Jang loves having breakfast...

290
00:25:02.528 --> 00:25:04.428
with his grandson every day.

291
00:25:04.829 --> 00:25:06.458
I'm doing all the work.

292
00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:08.369
I'm only putting one more spoon on the table,

293
00:25:08.369 --> 00:25:10.569
but it's so much work.

294
00:25:22.649 --> 00:25:25.079
Prospect research on hybrid market?

295
00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:28.619
Is this from our rival group?

296
00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:30.188
Yes. Also,

297
00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:33.188
securing lot for Chung A Bio-S Clean factory

298
00:25:33.488 --> 00:25:36.389
- is going smooth. - Okay.

299
00:25:38.899 --> 00:25:40.768
- President Woo. - Yes, sir.

300
00:25:40.928 --> 00:25:43.468
You know the company we bought in Myanmar.

301
00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:45.438
Send Boo Cheon there...

302
00:25:45.569 --> 00:25:47.909
to learn work for a year.

303
00:25:49.238 --> 00:25:50.238
Grandfather.

304
00:25:52.139 --> 00:25:55.109
Sir, there's nothing for Director Jang to learn.

305
00:25:55.879 --> 00:25:57.079
It's too small.

306
00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:59.518
I'm telling you to put him in charge because it's small.

307
00:25:59.948 --> 00:26:03.748
Go find out which market we must dominate...

308
00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:05.758
to make profit.

309
00:26:05.889 --> 00:26:09.589
I think it'll give a positive impression to our group...

310
00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:11.859
when an article about you learning business there gets released.

311
00:26:13.829 --> 00:26:15.399
You're right.

312
00:26:16.169 --> 00:26:19.169
I'll tell my father-in-law about it.

313
00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:20.198
Okay.

314
00:26:30.919 --> 00:26:34.049
Hey, Kang Pil Joo. I can't go to Myanmar. I'm not going!

315
00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:39.319
Hey, Kang Pil Joo.

316
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:41.589
What are we going to do?

317
00:26:41.629 --> 00:26:43.458
If I get stuck in Myanmar now,

318
00:26:44.028 --> 00:26:46.758
how am I going to marry Na Mo Hyun?

319
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:50.028
Hey, go persuade him.

320
00:26:50.299 --> 00:26:51.299
No.

321
00:26:52.498 --> 00:26:54.968
- Let's go beg him together. - There's no use.

322
00:26:56.639 --> 00:26:58.738
He said it in front of President Woo...

323
00:26:59.038 --> 00:27:01.849
to show you that he won't change his mind.

324
00:27:03.609 --> 00:27:06.518
Why does Grandfather hate me so much?

325
00:27:06.579 --> 00:27:09.448
He doesn't hate you, Boo Cheon.

326
00:27:10.018 --> 00:27:12.958
He just loves Chung A.

327
00:27:13.319 --> 00:27:16.129
There are only two types of person for Honorary Chairman.

328
00:27:17.428 --> 00:27:20.498
Person who's beneficial to Chung A...

329
00:27:21.198 --> 00:27:22.228
and...

330
00:27:23.899 --> 00:27:25.038
the rest.

331
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:37.819
Honorary Chairman went to work...

332
00:27:38.379 --> 00:27:39.778
accompanied by Yuh Cheon.

333
00:27:46.218 --> 00:27:47.329
Okay.

334
00:27:52.829 --> 00:27:54.299
I want simple lunch.

335
00:27:54.698 --> 00:27:57.339
- Get me udon. - Yes, ma'am.

336
00:28:10.619 --> 00:28:12.549
It'll become sticky if you knead it for a bit more.

337
00:28:14.089 --> 00:28:15.389
It's not easy at all.

338
00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:17.218
This is how she ate udon...

339
00:28:17.258 --> 00:28:18.758
even before she got married.

340
00:28:20.928 --> 00:28:21.988
By the way,

341
00:28:22.829 --> 00:28:25.099
she never eats in the study.

342
00:28:25.899 --> 00:28:27.228
It's strange.

343
00:28:27.369 --> 00:28:30.299
(Mooshimwon)

344
00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:33.839
Are you sure...

345
00:28:34.569 --> 00:28:36.238
there's no alternative way?

346
00:28:36.968 --> 00:28:39.639
- What if we fail? - We already failed.

347
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:44.178
He has to go to Myanmar soon.

348
00:28:44.819 --> 00:28:47.748
What if Grandfather tries something stupid?

349
00:28:48.288 --> 00:28:49.288
What are you going to do then?

350
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:52.419
Go. Go, and...

351
00:28:53.188 --> 00:28:55.428
stop Boo Cheon from going to Myanmar.

352
00:28:55.428 --> 00:28:56.428
Okay, ma'am.

353
00:28:57.458 --> 00:29:00.768
I'll tell him I'll leave Chung A as well...

354
00:29:01.198 --> 00:29:02.629
if he fails.

355
00:29:03.698 --> 00:29:05.069
I'll make sure to pay you...

356
00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:08.409
- if he can get married to her. - Okay.

357
00:29:40.433 --> 00:29:43.665

<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

358
00:30:33.958 --> 00:30:35.288
Why are we here?

359
00:30:49.309 --> 00:30:51.208
Sir.

360
00:30:51.938 --> 00:30:53.879
I'll build a Cheong A tower here for you.

361
00:30:53.978 --> 00:30:57.079
How can you build a tower here?

362
00:30:57.778 --> 00:31:00.448
Did you kidnap me to play a trick on me?

363
00:31:00.448 --> 00:31:02.288
I'm going to marry off...

364
00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:04.758
Boo Cheon to the daughter of Congressman Na Gi Chul,

365
00:31:05.288 --> 00:31:06.458
the future presidential candidate.

366
00:31:06.458 --> 00:31:09.758
What's good does marrying off Boo Cheon to his daughter do?

367
00:31:14.528 --> 00:31:15.869
That's right.

368
00:31:17.069 --> 00:31:18.099
So...

369
00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:19.369
Yes.

370
00:31:19.498 --> 00:31:22.309
You'll marry off Boo Cheon to his daughter,

371
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:25.579
so that the two families grow in trust.

372
00:31:25.708 --> 00:31:27.649
Once he becomes the president,

373
00:31:28.349 --> 00:31:31.079
we can get a permission to build a tower here.

374
00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:32.149
Yes, sir.

375
00:31:32.379 --> 00:31:33.619
Do you think it'll be easy...

376
00:31:33.619 --> 00:31:35.319
to marry off Boo Cheon?

377
00:31:35.319 --> 00:31:37.458
I'm thinking only of success.

378
00:31:40.258 --> 00:31:42.059
On your 100th birthday,

379
00:31:42.488 --> 00:31:44.928
I'll hold a grand party for you...

380
00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:48.728
on the 120th floor of our new tower.

381
00:31:53.339 --> 00:31:54.369
Good.

382
00:31:54.569 --> 00:31:57.508
It'll also be great to have my 120th birthday party...

383
00:31:57.508 --> 00:31:59.438
on the 120th floor.

384
00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:07.748
Make a list of how much political funding...

385
00:32:07.988 --> 00:32:09.288
we will need to support.

386
00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:12.389
Let's discuss this again with the list.

387
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:13.389
Yes, sir.

388
00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:27.909
That's enough. Let's go now.

389
00:32:28.538 --> 00:32:30.938
Oh, and I'll cancel the appointment...

390
00:32:31.139 --> 00:32:33.278
of Boo Cheon to Myanmar.

391
00:32:33.478 --> 00:32:34.708
Okay.

392
00:32:35.349 --> 00:32:36.649
We need...

393
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:38.649
that silly punk to be the groom.

394
00:32:39.448 --> 00:32:41.649
Marriage is also a business.

395
00:32:41.649 --> 00:32:43.649
They should be responsible if this business fails.

396
00:32:44.688 --> 00:32:46.288
What did they say they'll do...

397
00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:48.589
if this marriage doesn't work out?

398
00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:50.958
They said they'll hand over all their shares...

399
00:32:51.129 --> 00:32:52.829
and leave Cheong A.

400
00:32:54.928 --> 00:32:57.468
And I'll leave Cheong A as well...

401
00:32:58.639 --> 00:33:00.268
if this doesn't work out.

402
00:33:00.639 --> 00:33:02.839
You're all very determined.

403
00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:07.478
Do it in secret.

404
00:33:07.478 --> 00:33:10.448
Do it quietly so you don't cause any trouble.

405
00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:12.278
Or it'll go into vain.

406
00:33:12.379 --> 00:33:13.448
Okay, sir.

407
00:33:40.109 --> 00:33:41.149
You're really here.

408
00:33:45.919 --> 00:33:48.889
You'll go home if I kiss you, okay?

409
00:33:49.119 --> 00:33:50.188
Okay.

410
00:33:50.659 --> 00:33:51.659
Good.

411
00:33:56.188 --> 00:33:58.299
- Go now. - What?

412
00:33:58.299 --> 00:33:59.428
Hold on.

413
00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:11.279
Wait.

414
00:34:45.978 --> 00:34:47.009
Hello?

415
00:34:47.708 --> 00:34:48.978
Mo Hyun.

416
00:34:50.208 --> 00:34:52.679
Do you really not feel guilty?

417
00:34:53.018 --> 00:34:54.348
We know it all.

418
00:34:54.348 --> 00:34:56.018
Stop it.

419
00:34:56.018 --> 00:34:57.219
What?

420
00:34:58.158 --> 00:35:01.228
Sorry, Mo Hyun. It's because she keeps failing the exam.

421
00:35:01.228 --> 00:35:02.259
Don't worry.

422
00:35:02.658 --> 00:35:04.429
It's okay.

423
00:35:07.498 --> 00:35:08.598
Hey!

424
00:35:10.169 --> 00:35:11.969
Hey... Give me that.

425
00:35:14.438 --> 00:35:17.138
I submitted my application...

426
00:35:17.138 --> 00:35:19.109
to Myunghwa Middle School too.

427
00:35:21.478 --> 00:35:23.379
I didn't know.

428
00:35:24.478 --> 00:35:25.879
I really didn't know.

429
00:35:25.879 --> 00:35:28.188
Kyung Ho, don't you think...

430
00:35:28.348 --> 00:35:31.919
she got accepted with Congressman Na as her background?

431
00:35:31.919 --> 00:35:32.958
Gosh.

432
00:35:33.888 --> 00:35:36.359
Look at how she can't say anything.

433
00:35:36.359 --> 00:35:37.399
So Hee.

434
00:35:39.098 --> 00:35:40.328
My dad...

435
00:35:41.969 --> 00:35:44.169
is this kind of person.

436
00:35:44.899 --> 00:35:45.938
He doesn't let me...

437
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:49.908
go to the interview...

438
00:35:50.268 --> 00:35:51.779
if the director of the school...

439
00:35:52.308 --> 00:35:54.078
calls him and talks about me.

440
00:35:55.649 --> 00:35:56.779
Liar.

441
00:35:57.679 --> 00:35:58.819
I'm serious.

442
00:36:01.949 --> 00:36:04.658
Mo Hyun and that guy don't seem so close with each other.

443
00:36:04.658 --> 00:36:05.688
Let's go.

444
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:08.958
You can go first.

445
00:36:10.328 --> 00:36:11.958
Okay, I'll see you later.

446
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:20.199
I respect my dad.

447
00:36:23.009 --> 00:36:24.509
Please take back...

448
00:36:27.449 --> 00:36:28.808
what you just said.

449
00:38:38.279 --> 00:38:39.978
Hey, are you okay?

450
00:38:41.279 --> 00:38:42.908
She's very drunk.

451
00:38:42.908 --> 00:38:44.049
Why are you alone?

452
00:38:44.779 --> 00:38:46.649
- Who are you? - I'll take you to your house.

453
00:38:46.649 --> 00:38:47.688
What?

454
00:38:47.688 --> 00:38:49.518
- Stand up. - What are you doing?

455
00:38:49.518 --> 00:38:51.859
- Let's go. - Stop.

456
00:38:51.919 --> 00:38:52.989
What?

457
00:38:55.129 --> 00:38:56.259
Who are you?

458
00:38:56.288 --> 00:38:57.458
Gosh.

459
00:39:02.598 --> 00:39:03.768
Gosh.

460
00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:07.569
Who are you, punk?

461
00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:11.109
Why this little...

462
00:39:15.748 --> 00:39:17.219
Let's go.

463
00:39:27.629 --> 00:39:29.158
Thank you.

464
00:39:31.098 --> 00:39:32.958
Thank you.

465
00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:39.598
Thank you.

466
00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:09.429
Kyung Ho,

467
00:40:10.129 --> 00:40:11.438
I'm sorry.

468
00:40:12.498 --> 00:40:14.509
I'm too heavy, aren't I?

469
00:40:16.308 --> 00:40:18.138
I can walk home.

470
00:40:18.679 --> 00:40:22.109
If you drink a lot and act like you're not drunk again,

471
00:40:23.679 --> 00:40:24.848
I'll scold you hard.

472
00:40:38.399 --> 00:40:39.458
Kyung Ho.

473
00:40:40.228 --> 00:40:42.129
You trust me, right?

474
00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:45.069
My dad...

475
00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:49.408
didn't even know that I applied for Myunghwa Middle School.

476
00:40:51.578 --> 00:40:52.908
It's real.

477
00:40:57.219 --> 00:40:58.248
I trust you.

478
00:41:58.779 --> 00:42:00.308
I made pollack soup for you.

479
00:42:02.408 --> 00:42:04.779
I won't eat it. I might throw up if I do.

480
00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:07.078
You learned how to drink from your dad,

481
00:42:07.149 --> 00:42:10.089
so you should know how to stop before you get drunk.

482
00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:11.658
It's a surprise that you came home safely.

483
00:42:13.388 --> 00:42:15.129
Kyung Ho took me home.

484
00:42:15.129 --> 00:42:17.899
I heard a bell ring and found you outside alone.

485
00:42:20.228 --> 00:42:23.129
He must've left me in front of the gate.

486
00:42:24.799 --> 00:42:27.038
No, I think he carried me on his back.

487
00:42:27.408 --> 00:42:29.638
Goodness gracious.

488
00:42:29.638 --> 00:42:30.938
You can't do that.

489
00:42:31.208 --> 00:42:32.938
Don't let just any man carry you on his back.

490
00:42:32.938 --> 00:42:36.478
It's not just any man. It's Kyung Ho. Don't you know him?

491
00:42:38.078 --> 00:42:39.779
I'll tell him to be responsible for me since he carried me.

492
00:42:39.879 --> 00:42:42.188
What? Why this...

493
00:42:42.748 --> 00:42:44.859
- You're not sober yet, are you? - No.

494
00:42:45.489 --> 00:42:47.328
I'm still drunk.

495
00:42:50.288 --> 00:42:52.259
Gosh, hey.

496
00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:55.429
I can't talk much because I feel nauseous.

497
00:42:57.029 --> 00:42:59.598
You really didn't carry me home?

498
00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:01.868
You sent all of us home by taxi.

499
00:43:02.009 --> 00:43:03.708
- You gave us taxi fee too. - What?

500
00:43:14.919 --> 00:43:15.949
Who was it?

501
00:43:15.949 --> 00:43:18.419
Congressman Na who failed to be a presidential candidate this year...

502
00:43:18.458 --> 00:43:21.589
has accepted Congressman Lee's offer...

503
00:43:21.688 --> 00:43:23.188
- to be his chief campaigner. - Hang up for a second.

504
00:43:24.058 --> 00:43:27.768
Mom, did you know that Dad is going to be the chief campaigner?

505
00:43:27.998 --> 00:43:31.268
Last night, Congressman Na accepted to be the chief campaigner.

506
00:43:31.739 --> 00:43:33.839
It's said that he's discussing a campaign strategy...

507
00:43:33.868 --> 00:43:36.908
with Congressman Lee during their breakfast at the moment.

508
00:43:38.908 --> 00:43:41.109
We'll take it as a positive signal...

509
00:43:41.808 --> 00:43:43.009
to our offer...

510
00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:46.049
if you accept to be the chief campaigner.

511
00:43:46.449 --> 00:43:49.518
We'll proceed the marriage between the two.

512
00:43:54.859 --> 00:43:56.958
Now, it's up to you, Boo Cheon.

513
00:43:58.598 --> 00:44:02.098
Congressman Na becoming the chief campaigner...

514
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:05.069
means that he accepts our offer.

515
00:44:19.978 --> 00:44:22.618
When will you get rid of Boo Cheon's girlfriend?

516
00:44:23.288 --> 00:44:26.089
- So you knew it. - I assumed it at first,

517
00:44:27.058 --> 00:44:28.629
but these days, I smell her perfume.

518
00:44:29.888 --> 00:44:31.958
It's such a vulgar scent of perfume.

519
00:44:35.399 --> 00:44:36.699
Why aren't you answering?

520
00:44:37.538 --> 00:44:39.799
- Shall I do it myself? - I'll do it.

521
00:44:40.868 --> 00:44:42.839
I was planning to get rid of her soon anyway.

522
00:44:55.748 --> 00:44:59.618
What did you do that he canceled the appointment only after a day?

523
00:45:00.759 --> 00:45:02.259
I want to know the reason too.

524
00:45:02.989 --> 00:45:04.929
Can you go ask Grandfather...

525
00:45:05.799 --> 00:45:06.998
and share the reason with me too?

526
00:45:46.169 --> 00:45:47.768
I'm still on my duty, but you want me to leave all of a sudden?

527
00:45:49.268 --> 00:45:51.839
I can't leave, being treated like a piece of luggage.

528
00:45:52.339 --> 00:45:53.578
What do you want?

529
00:45:54.149 --> 00:45:56.808
I want to see him.

530
00:46:03.188 --> 00:46:06.688
(Boo Cheon)

531
00:46:07.188 --> 00:46:09.359
- Hello? - Yes, sir. It's Attorney Kang.

532
00:46:09.788 --> 00:46:11.598
Ms. Yoon Seo Won, the receptionist,

533
00:46:12.158 --> 00:46:14.929
has been appointed to the Chinese branch of Cheong A Motors.

534
00:46:15.199 --> 00:46:18.339
She wants to see you before she leaves.

535
00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:27.348
Yoon Seo Won? Who's she?

536
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:31.219
Why does she want to see me when I don't know her?

537
00:46:39.819 --> 00:46:41.859
How dare he...

538
00:47:18.828 --> 00:47:20.029
The flight has departed.

539
00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:22.429
I checked her name on the passenger list.

540
00:47:39.649 --> 00:47:41.989
- Go home by my car. - I'll just go.

541
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:44.419
Okay, then just go.

542
00:47:45.288 --> 00:47:46.359
Good job today.

543
00:47:48.429 --> 00:47:49.429
Pil Joo.

544
00:47:51.629 --> 00:47:52.699
Let's grab a drink.

545
00:47:53.399 --> 00:47:55.328
- Come in. - Let's go somewhere outside.

546
00:47:56.728 --> 00:47:59.569
I don't like either this house or your room.

547
00:48:00.299 --> 00:48:01.868
Your room is huge,

548
00:48:02.038 --> 00:48:04.679
but it feels like the tiny room of slaves in historical dramas.

549
00:48:06.038 --> 00:48:08.379
Let's go outside and have some makgeolli.

550
00:48:13.348 --> 00:48:14.348
Pil Joo.

551
00:48:18.018 --> 00:48:19.018
(Auntie)

552
00:48:19.518 --> 00:48:21.188
(Auntie)

553
00:49:05.669 --> 00:49:09.669
I didn't know there's this kind of place in the middle of Seoul.

554
00:49:09.908 --> 00:49:11.179
What's the matter?

555
00:49:15.449 --> 00:49:18.348
It's been quite a while since I accepted to be the chief campaigner.

556
00:49:18.748 --> 00:49:20.379
Why haven't I gotten any calls from you?

557
00:49:21.919 --> 00:49:24.489
I should know how the things are going.

558
00:49:24.958 --> 00:49:27.089
Your daughter and Director Jang...

559
00:49:27.989 --> 00:49:31.598
safely had their coincidental first encounter.

560
00:49:32.458 --> 00:49:35.129
And they'll run into each other coincidentally...

561
00:49:35.669 --> 00:49:37.239
a few times more from now on.

562
00:49:40.098 --> 00:49:41.669
I hope you don't contact me...

563
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:44.279
regarding their relationship.

564
00:49:44.938 --> 00:49:46.808
My daughter's life depends on this.

565
00:49:46.839 --> 00:49:48.848
Their encounters should be as natural as possible.

566
00:49:49.779 --> 00:49:51.819
Wouldn't it be more natural...

567
00:49:52.379 --> 00:49:54.089
if you don't know any of this?

568
00:49:56.118 --> 00:49:58.919
Then I'll go down first.

569
00:50:13.138 --> 00:50:14.408
(Congressman Na Gi Chul)

570
00:50:20.908 --> 00:50:23.009
Is it that shocking to see me in your office?

571
00:50:28.219 --> 00:50:31.219
You've never come to visit my office before.

572
00:50:32.719 --> 00:50:34.688
Right, it's my first time.

573
00:50:35.888 --> 00:50:39.129
I felt like you needed me.

574
00:50:40.799 --> 00:50:43.969
Mom said she didn't know anything about the chief campaigner either.

575
00:50:45.598 --> 00:50:47.308
You did a very good job...

576
00:50:48.839 --> 00:50:50.478
in accepting the position.

577
00:50:51.739 --> 00:50:54.549
I feel much better thanks to you.

578
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:57.078
On the night you lost to Congressman Lee,

579
00:50:57.578 --> 00:51:00.489
your advisers came to our house and said they couldn't accept it,

580
00:51:00.819 --> 00:51:03.819
claiming that Congressman Lee bribed other members to vote for him...

581
00:51:04.158 --> 00:51:06.819
because you maintained a big lead in the polls,

582
00:51:06.819 --> 00:51:08.388
and they even suggested defection.

583
00:51:08.388 --> 00:51:09.888
But you said this.

584
00:51:11.058 --> 00:51:13.158
"I cannot break the rules..."

585
00:51:13.458 --> 00:51:15.268
"because they broke the rules first."

586
00:51:16.368 --> 00:51:18.438
"Although the competition wasn't a fair one,"

587
00:51:19.038 --> 00:51:21.469
"admitting the result will bring about..."

588
00:51:21.638 --> 00:51:23.739
"a great progress of the nation's democracy."

589
00:51:26.339 --> 00:51:27.379
When I heard that,

590
00:51:28.308 --> 00:51:31.219
I realized how happy and lucky I was...

591
00:51:31.578 --> 00:51:32.819
to have a father like you.

592
00:51:34.388 --> 00:51:36.489
Help Candidate Lee become the president this time,

593
00:51:37.259 --> 00:51:39.788
and run for the presidency again five years later.

594
00:51:40.888 --> 00:51:43.228
I'm sure the party members will choose your sincerity...

595
00:51:44.629 --> 00:51:46.728
over money in the future.

596
00:52:15.089 --> 00:52:16.429
You turned off your phone.

597
00:52:16.929 --> 00:52:17.958
I did.

598
00:52:18.529 --> 00:52:19.828
Grandfather is waiting.

599
00:52:25.038 --> 00:52:26.038
He told me to have you attend when I...

600
00:52:26.938 --> 00:52:30.069
sign the agreement to turn over Daeil Distribution to Yuh Cheon.

601
00:52:30.908 --> 00:52:34.308
That deal must have been withdrawn after I elaborated...

602
00:52:34.649 --> 00:52:36.149
on Cheong A Tower plan.

603
00:52:37.219 --> 00:52:39.279
I can see that you're bewildered.

604
00:52:39.978 --> 00:52:41.419
You're rambling on.

605
00:52:44.658 --> 00:52:46.589
That makes me even sadder.

606
00:52:48.328 --> 00:52:50.458
I thought it was all resolved thanks to the marriage project.

607
00:52:50.498 --> 00:52:51.529
But I was wrong.

608
00:52:53.199 --> 00:52:54.569
Grandfather wants to hand over...

609
00:52:54.569 --> 00:52:56.469
Daeil Distribution to Yuh Cheon no matter what.

610
00:53:00.438 --> 00:53:03.239
If it's listed, its aggregate market price will be over two billion.

611
00:53:03.239 --> 00:53:04.308
Yuh Cheon, that jerk...

612
00:53:05.138 --> 00:53:07.208
This is why he was buttering Grandfather up.

613
00:53:10.618 --> 00:53:11.649
Pil Joo.

614
00:53:13.748 --> 00:53:16.319
At his memorial service after my grandfather passes away,

615
00:53:17.618 --> 00:53:19.188
I won't make a deep bow.

616
00:53:20.888 --> 00:53:23.759
He says I'm not fully grown yet,

617
00:53:24.199 --> 00:53:25.299
so I won't make full bows either.

618
00:53:26.658 --> 00:53:29.529
Your grandfather is such an amazing person.

619
00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:32.669
I'm sure he'll live to a great age.

620
00:53:33.138 --> 00:53:34.469
His first goal is...

621
00:53:35.268 --> 00:53:36.908
to enjoy 120 years of longevity, right?

622
00:53:36.938 --> 00:53:38.679
His second goal is to have eternal life.

623
00:53:47.288 --> 00:53:48.518
I heard that you asked for me.

624
00:53:48.518 --> 00:53:51.518
Right. You look more than fine.

625
00:53:52.188 --> 00:53:55.089
As you drank too much last night,

626
00:53:55.288 --> 00:53:57.699
Executive Jung suggested I talk to you in the morning.

627
00:54:00.629 --> 00:54:02.228
Why don't you come into my room?

628
00:54:02.669 --> 00:54:04.569
I have something to tell you in private.

629
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:17.078
(Agreement, Transfer-Acquisition Contract)

630
00:54:20.688 --> 00:54:21.888
If Yuh Cheon obtains...

631
00:54:22.018 --> 00:54:24.589
Daeil Distribution at the same value Director Jang inherited,

632
00:54:25.058 --> 00:54:27.888
the National Tax Service would find the transfer tax problematic,

633
00:54:27.888 --> 00:54:29.058
and the Financial Supervisory Commission...

634
00:54:29.228 --> 00:54:31.699
would bring breach of Capital Market Act into question.

635
00:54:31.699 --> 00:54:34.029
Executive Jung said the same thing before.

636
00:54:34.399 --> 00:54:36.728
Do you really think I had no idea about those?

637
00:54:37.699 --> 00:54:38.998
We're family.

638
00:54:39.199 --> 00:54:41.308
If such legal problems arouse later,

639
00:54:41.308 --> 00:54:44.009
we'll find ways to deal with them, Attorney Kang.

640
00:54:45.609 --> 00:54:48.308
As we confirmed it in the presence of a lawyer,

641
00:54:48.649 --> 00:54:51.248
if the legal team doesn't cooperate,

642
00:54:51.248 --> 00:54:53.788
take the seals of Yuh Cheol and Boo Cheol and finalize it.

643
00:54:55.188 --> 00:54:56.288
Yes, sir.

644
00:54:58.859 --> 00:55:00.629
Executive Jung,

645
00:55:01.228 --> 00:55:03.799
you need to learn how to be grateful.

646
00:55:04.498 --> 00:55:06.529
I took back my decision...

647
00:55:06.529 --> 00:55:07.929
and let you keep staying in here.

648
00:55:08.399 --> 00:55:10.299
Then you should express your gratitude.

649
00:55:36.788 --> 00:55:38.098
Executive Jung worked tirelessly...

650
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:41.469
to make Daeil Distribution into a successful business.

651
00:55:43.169 --> 00:55:44.739
She must be perturbed.

652
00:55:46.169 --> 00:55:47.808
Help her feel better.

653
00:57:20.058 --> 00:57:23.629
Can't you even stand this trivial pain?

654
00:57:35.808 --> 00:57:39.679
She set the new record of 21.04 seconds...

655
00:57:39.679 --> 00:57:41.719
for the women's 100-meter backstroke in the Asian Games.

656
00:57:41.719 --> 00:57:44.419
She won Korea's first swimming gold medal.

657
00:57:45.388 --> 00:57:46.419
With the great applause...

658
00:57:46.419 --> 00:57:49.489
You should also win a gold medal in the Olympics later.

659
00:57:51.098 --> 00:57:52.328
Gold medal.

660
00:57:54.828 --> 00:57:57.669
Please teach me how to swim.

661
00:57:58.638 --> 00:57:59.998
Lie down like this.

662
00:58:00.368 --> 00:58:01.938
("Vice Chairman Jang Soo Man of Cheong A Died")

663
00:58:01.938 --> 00:58:06.438
("Vice President Jang Soo Man of Cheong A Died")

664
00:58:06.438 --> 00:58:08.348
("Jang Seong Man Appointed as New Vice President")

665
00:58:26.399 --> 00:58:28.228
Stay in the villa written on it.

666
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:31.469
Father will send someone there.

667
00:59:00.469 --> 00:59:01.969
Your grandfather...

668
00:59:02.169 --> 00:59:04.538
is waiting at the house across the river.

669
00:59:42.908 --> 00:59:44.208
Until he pokes...

670
00:59:44.879 --> 00:59:46.708
his own eyes,

671
00:59:47.248 --> 00:59:49.279
cuts his own flesh,

672
00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:53.149
and throttles himself,

673
00:59:54.018 --> 00:59:55.419
don't give way to anything,

674
00:59:56.919 --> 00:59:58.219
Ms. Jung Mal Lan.

675
01:00:09.699 --> 01:00:13.038
(Money Flower)

676
01:00:32.989 --> 01:00:35.188
What a coincidence.

677
01:00:35.228 --> 01:00:37.558
It's nice to meet you. I'm Jang Boo Cheon.

678
01:00:37.558 --> 01:00:39.629
I'm Kang Pil Joo.

679
01:00:39.629 --> 01:00:41.328
What do you do?

680
01:00:41.328 --> 01:00:43.368
I need to delete all the online articles...

681
01:00:43.368 --> 01:00:45.538
about me and Jang Boo Cheon.

682
01:00:45.569 --> 01:00:47.408
Five years isn't a long time, sir.

683
01:00:47.408 --> 01:00:48.768
You should prepare in advance.

684
01:00:48.768 --> 01:00:51.109
I'll give you the money on the wedding day.

685
01:00:51.239 --> 01:00:53.978
Cheong A must be owned by one person no matter what.

686
01:00:54.279 --> 01:00:55.449
You have 15 days.

687
01:00:55.478 --> 01:00:57.879
Let me meet with Boo Cheon's future wife within 15 days.
