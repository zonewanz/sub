00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.430
(Episode 22)

2
00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.194
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:33.306
Oh, right.

4
00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:37.346
Please check the meeting time for today's client.

5
00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:38.586
Okay.

6
00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.855
Mr. Kang, did you get home safely last night?

7
00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:50.895
Yes.

8
00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:09.846
Wait, Ah Reum.

9
00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:12.346
Wait.

10
00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:14.815
Can I...

11
00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:16.915
kiss you?

12
00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:21.925
Wake up!

13
00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:31.266
Why am I dreaming about her?

14
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.805
"Can I kiss you?"

15
00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:38.805
Why would you ask?

16
00:01:46.886 --> 00:01:48.915
Just a moment.

17
00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:53.326
(Spam)

18
00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:04.606
(Young Shim)

19
00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:07.236
Fried chicken place tonight, okay?

20
00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:18.345
(Bombed Jung Woo Sung)

21
00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:20.316
What are you doing, friend?

22
00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:32.395
- Ms. Han? - What?

23
00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:35.435
Who is it? Your boyfriend?

24
00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:38.266
Is it Jung Woo Sung?

25
00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:40.775
What are you talking about? It's not.

26
00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:43.706
Come on, tell the truth.

27
00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:45.305
It's not him.

28
00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:53.546
- What's wrong? - What?

29
00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:57.756
I feel stuffed up as if I have indigestion,

30
00:02:57.756 --> 00:02:59.886
and my face flushes up.

31
00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:02.655
My heart beats fast sometimes, and I can't sleep.

32
00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:03.856
It's so odd.

33
00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:06.226
What's wrong with me?

34
00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:12.106
Ms. Han, I totally know what you have.

35
00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:14.606
- What? - Menopause.

36
00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:17.375
Those are my mom's symptoms.

37
00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:21.175
Right, it must be menopause. That must be it.

38
00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:29.685
Lawyer Kang Kyung Seok's office.

39
00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:32.185
It's Seoul Bank's loan application division.

40
00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:35.055
Mr. Kang isn't answering his phone.

41
00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:37.696
Is he in?

42
00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:46.935
Are you tired?

43
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.335
Thanks for the coffee.

44
00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:55.516
Do you have something to say?

45
00:03:55.516 --> 00:03:59.446
Seoul Bank's loan application division called.

46
00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:01.886
They want you to call back.

47
00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:03.456
Okay.

48
00:04:04.986 --> 00:04:07.595
Why? Are you worried?

49
00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:09.525
That we'll go bankrupt?

50
00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:12.196
That you won't get paid?

51
00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:14.935
No, I'm not worried.

52
00:04:18.965 --> 00:04:22.436
We secured distribution in France, Germany, and the Czech Republic,

53
00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:23.905
the main hubs of Europe.

54
00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:27.516
We haven't signed the contracts yet, so it's not yet confirmed.

55
00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:30.275
Stay in touch with the other companies as well.

56
00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:33.985
Distribution is about the channels. That's all for today.

57
00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:36.556
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

58
00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:46.465
Just a moment, sir. Can you have a look at this?

59
00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:53.706
- Rumors have spread. - What rumors?

60
00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:55.405
That you rejected the chairman's niece.

61
00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:58.006
When she went all the way to Jeju Island.

62
00:04:58.105 --> 00:04:59.576
Who started that rumor?

63
00:04:59.576 --> 00:05:02.516
It wasn't me. Don't you trust me?

64
00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:06.715
- I do. - Why did you do that?

65
00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:10.155
- What? - I heard you were so rude.

66
00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:12.626
I heard you rushed out of the hotel.

67
00:05:14.326 --> 00:05:18.165
I had no choice. Someone was waiting for me.

68
00:05:18.165 --> 00:05:19.266
Who?

69
00:05:22.095 --> 00:05:23.496
My girlfriend.

70
00:05:24.136 --> 00:05:25.405
Your girlfriend?

71
00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:32.275
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:34.316
You never told me about this.

73
00:05:34.746 --> 00:05:36.715
This is unbelievable. Ji Won.

74
00:05:37.386 --> 00:05:38.946
My goodness.

75
00:05:41.386 --> 00:05:43.756
Am I the only one who knows?

76
00:05:43.756 --> 00:05:47.225
That's why... Okay?

77
00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:49.795
Give me the details from start to finish.

78
00:05:49.795 --> 00:05:50.826
The 5 Ws and H.

79
00:05:50.826 --> 00:05:53.095
That's it. We just got together.

80
00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:54.835
Really?

81
00:05:56.636 --> 00:05:58.436
Why am I so excited?

82
00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:01.676
You can't stop grinning.

83
00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:04.275
It's been so long, and a superstar...

84
00:06:06.345 --> 00:06:09.016
- Shut your mouth. - Sorry.

85
00:06:09.215 --> 00:06:11.845
- Calm yourself down. - Okay.

86
00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:14.456
What do you do on dates?

87
00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:18.155
She isn't just any celebrity. She's a superstar.

88
00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:20.795
We get by somehow.

89
00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:22.725
How?

90
00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:26.095
Poor superstar girlfriend.

91
00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:27.795
She likes it a lot.

92
00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:30.035
She told me to come home early for dinner.

93
00:06:30.035 --> 00:06:32.266
That's exactly the problem.

94
00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:35.436
- What is? - Will you stay home all the time?

95
00:06:36.206 --> 00:06:39.446
Although of course, being alone with her at home...

96
00:06:39.446 --> 00:06:41.345
is better than anything.

97
00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:44.645
You two can't go out freely.

98
00:06:44.645 --> 00:06:46.746
That's why celebrities meet in groups,

99
00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:48.686
not just alone in private.

100
00:06:48.985 --> 00:06:51.355
For example, with her stylist.

101
00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:53.926
Her stylist.

102
00:06:56.056 --> 00:07:00.095
You two, I, and Mi Dal. We could meet up.

103
00:07:00.735 --> 00:07:02.095
The four of us.

104
00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:08.206
- For whose sake? - Whose do you think?

105
00:07:08.206 --> 00:07:11.206
I'd do that for you and your blossoming love.

106
00:07:11.206 --> 00:07:12.376
What?

107
00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:17.645
Anthony and Sa Jin Jin went on their honeymoon.

108
00:07:18.415 --> 00:07:20.855
Look at them. They look great together.

109
00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:21.985
They do.

110
00:07:21.985 --> 00:07:25.386
I really hope Anthony and Jin Jin get married in real life.

111
00:07:32.196 --> 00:07:34.965
I think that would be great.

112
00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:57.285
I have something to say. I'd like to meet.

113
00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:24.915
(I have something to say. I'd like to meet.)

114
00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:33.885
I have something to say. Are you free this weekend?

115
00:08:34.595 --> 00:08:37.625
Anthony? What does he want to say?

116
00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:39.826
Jin Jin.

117
00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:44.335
- See you in Seoul. - Of course. We must.

118
00:08:45.235 --> 00:08:46.666
I have something to say.

119
00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:54.345
Okay. I'm free.

120
00:08:59.085 --> 00:09:00.245
Ji Won.

121
00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:04.286
Mom and I got you some tonic too.

122
00:09:04.286 --> 00:09:05.755
I'll leave it on the table.

123
00:09:05.755 --> 00:09:07.456
What for? I'm healthy.

124
00:09:07.456 --> 00:09:10.026
You suffer from rhinitis in the winter.

125
00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:13.095
- Take it every day. - Thanks.

126
00:09:22.635 --> 00:09:24.776
(Speeding ticket)

127
00:09:31.345 --> 00:09:33.546
(Location: Myeongjin Hospital)

128
00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:44.696
I wasn't able to go to the hospital.

129
00:09:46.865 --> 00:09:49.936
(Location: Myeongjin Hospital)

130
00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:18.625
- What's wrong? - Oh dear.

131
00:10:21.635 --> 00:10:24.365
It's not serious. I cut myself.

132
00:10:24.605 --> 00:10:27.265
After years of using a knife?

133
00:10:27.265 --> 00:10:28.375
Wake up.

134
00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:31.546
My eyes are bleary and cloudy.

135
00:10:31.646 --> 00:10:33.375
Because of the leeks.

136
00:10:33.975 --> 00:10:37.546
I've chopped leeks many times before. I'm an expert.

137
00:10:37.646 --> 00:10:39.786
See an eye doctor.

138
00:10:40.686 --> 00:10:42.416
You told me not to.

139
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:47.556
Where are the band-aids? Come here.

140
00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:49.056
Goodness.

141
00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:04.806
Look who's here. Aren't you Anthony?

142
00:11:04.806 --> 00:11:05.875
I am.

143
00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:08.176
I'm Sa Jin Jin's mom.

144
00:11:08.176 --> 00:11:10.076
Oh, how are you?

145
00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:13.546
Thanks so much for being at the hospital.

146
00:11:13.646 --> 00:11:15.855
Jin Jin could've been seriously ill.

147
00:11:15.855 --> 00:11:18.855
Thanks for helping out when you must've been so busy.

148
00:11:18.855 --> 00:11:21.026
I'm enjoying "We Got Married".

149
00:11:22.526 --> 00:11:25.465
Jin Jin needs a lot of help and guidance.

150
00:11:25.465 --> 00:11:26.995
Help her out.

151
00:11:28.965 --> 00:11:31.335
Did Ji Won tell you that...

152
00:11:31.335 --> 00:11:33.605
I invited you over to eat one day?

153
00:11:33.605 --> 00:11:35.706
Come over with him.

154
00:11:36.776 --> 00:11:37.845
I will.

155
00:11:38.706 --> 00:11:41.046
Did you stop by Ji Won's?

156
00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:43.276
Yes, our mom sent me.

157
00:11:43.276 --> 00:11:45.385
I know Kwang Hee well.

158
00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:48.855
She moved here when she was 20.

159
00:11:52.355 --> 00:11:54.855
- See you around. - Bye.

160
00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:01.635
Wait, wait.

161
00:12:04.536 --> 00:12:05.906
Take these.

162
00:12:07.306 --> 00:12:08.975
It's not much.

163
00:12:09.235 --> 00:12:11.306
I heard that you live alone.

164
00:12:11.306 --> 00:12:13.505
I'm fine. Give it to Ji Won.

165
00:12:13.505 --> 00:12:16.046
I can always bring some more downstairs.

166
00:12:16.176 --> 00:12:18.515
I made a lot to share. Take it.

167
00:12:18.816 --> 00:12:20.515
Thank you.

168
00:12:21.786 --> 00:12:24.855
Season the soup with salt to your liking.

169
00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:27.656
Put whatever's left in the fridge.

170
00:12:28.156 --> 00:12:31.965
Heat it on a stove, not in the microwave.

171
00:12:31.965 --> 00:12:33.125
Okay.

174
00:14:10.156 --> 00:14:12.225
- Ms. Choi. - Hello.

175
00:14:13.196 --> 00:14:16.095
I heard Anthony's making quite a lot.

176
00:14:16.095 --> 00:14:18.465
Were you checking your bank account?

177
00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:23.105
- I was. - Buy me some ramyeon.

178
00:14:24.105 --> 00:14:27.176
Jin Jin helped make him famous again.

179
00:14:27.546 --> 00:14:29.916
I can do that. Let's go.

180
00:14:39.885 --> 00:14:42.125
Why did Anthony say no to the rubber gloves?

181
00:14:42.956 --> 00:14:44.326
He just did.

182
00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:46.625
He's monitoring his image.

183
00:14:46.896 --> 00:14:48.265
Silly Jin Jin...

184
00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:51.706
got so excited about promoting rubber gloves.

185
00:14:53.206 --> 00:14:55.335
Anthony's wisdom kept her out of trouble.

186
00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:57.605
Thank you.

187
00:14:59.306 --> 00:15:04.015
"We Got Married" did a lot to make her seem more approachable.

188
00:15:04.015 --> 00:15:05.485
She doesn't need to be.

189
00:15:05.885 --> 00:15:07.816
Psychos keep sending weird presents.

190
00:15:07.956 --> 00:15:09.656
I'm so stressed.

191
00:15:10.456 --> 00:15:11.485
Right.

192
00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:13.286
Where's your office?

193
00:15:14.095 --> 00:15:16.156
Oh, our office?

194
00:15:16.156 --> 00:15:19.265
We get a lot of couple gifts that Anthony should take.

195
00:15:19.265 --> 00:15:21.495
Set them aside. I'll pick them up.

196
00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:22.995
Do that, then.

197
00:15:23.765 --> 00:15:26.265
Can I order more gimbap?

198
00:15:26.335 --> 00:15:30.135
Of course. Can we have another gimbap?

199
00:15:32.576 --> 00:15:33.706
Hello.

200
00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:35.475
Come in.

201
00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:36.916
Wait.

202
00:15:38.215 --> 00:15:39.816
- I have a present. - What?

203
00:15:56.095 --> 00:15:58.365
Anthony's present bothered you?

204
00:15:58.605 --> 00:15:59.806
Are you jealous?

205
00:16:00.706 --> 00:16:03.375
I only saw that word in books.

206
00:16:03.676 --> 00:16:05.105
I don't know what that is.

207
00:16:05.406 --> 00:16:06.505
Is jealousy...

208
00:16:07.916 --> 00:16:09.646
something you feel towards...

209
00:16:10.276 --> 00:16:13.715
someone smarter, richer, or more affluent than you?

210
00:16:15.456 --> 00:16:18.326
I love it. You got jealous about me.

211
00:16:19.826 --> 00:16:20.896
Right?

212
00:16:22.696 --> 00:16:23.826
I guess so.

213
00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:26.896
I love jealous men.

214
00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:29.995
- I must be a pervert. - You're not.

215
00:16:30.296 --> 00:16:31.365
Pass the oil.

216
00:16:32.335 --> 00:16:33.335
Here.

217
00:16:34.276 --> 00:16:35.335
Wait.

218
00:16:35.635 --> 00:16:37.206
You should use the leek oil.

219
00:16:37.546 --> 00:16:38.646
What?

220
00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:42.416
Inexperienced cooks add onion.

221
00:16:42.615 --> 00:16:44.286
- Are you taking classes? - Yes.

222
00:16:44.385 --> 00:16:45.515
From whom?

223
00:16:45.515 --> 00:16:46.585
Mr. Baek.

224
00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:49.385
Mr. Baek? Who's Mr. Baek?

225
00:16:49.956 --> 00:16:51.125
Don't you know?

226
00:16:51.755 --> 00:16:54.326
You know nothing about living alone.

227
00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:56.595
He's the savior of everyone who lives alone.

228
00:16:56.696 --> 00:16:57.796
I don't know.

229
00:16:58.095 --> 00:16:59.196
I don't need...

230
00:17:00.796 --> 00:17:02.495
someone like him.

231
00:17:04.265 --> 00:17:05.606
It's so cold.

232
00:17:05.765 --> 00:17:07.735
The weather's so extreme.

233
00:17:07.775 --> 00:17:08.975
It's freezing.

234
00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:16.676

235
00:17:18.446 --> 00:17:21.255
- Like whom? - I think you are.

236
00:17:21.515 --> 00:17:23.015
I'm not.

237
00:17:25.755 --> 00:17:28.096
It's so hot. I feel so hot.

238
00:17:28.995 --> 00:17:30.196
You feel hot?

239
00:17:30.426 --> 00:17:31.666
It's freezing.

240
00:17:31.965 --> 00:17:34.795
Ms. Han, shouldn't you see a doctor?

241
00:17:35.836 --> 00:17:37.136
A doctor?

242
00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:41.406
Yes, a doctor.

243
00:17:41.606 --> 00:17:44.505
I should see a doctor.

244
00:17:57.886 --> 00:18:00.156
What are you doing here?

245
00:18:00.255 --> 00:18:01.995
- I'm sick. - Are you?

246
00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:04.725
- How? - Listen to my symptoms.

247
00:18:04.965 --> 00:18:06.525
I'm listening.

248
00:18:06.626 --> 00:18:09.666
Ever since that pervert taxi driver scared me,

249
00:18:09.836 --> 00:18:12.706
I've had sweaty palms, my heart pounds,

250
00:18:12.805 --> 00:18:16.106
and I hyperventilate whenever I think of him.

251
00:18:16.206 --> 00:18:17.545
Is it the stress?

252
00:18:17.946 --> 00:18:19.346
Let me see.

253
00:18:21.045 --> 00:18:22.275
There's no fever.

254
00:18:22.646 --> 00:18:24.886
Do you have headaches or feel nauseous?

255
00:18:25.015 --> 00:18:26.346
Or are you on...

256
00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:28.515
any medication?

257
00:18:28.686 --> 00:18:29.785
No.

258
00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:31.456
But...

259
00:18:32.025 --> 00:18:33.555
I think I found my medicine.

260
00:18:33.555 --> 00:18:35.096
Did you? What is it?

261
00:18:40.596 --> 00:18:41.735
You.

262
00:18:43.065 --> 00:18:44.136

263
00:18:44.265 --> 00:18:45.336
Yes.

264
00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:47.676

Okay.

270

But you have to finish this.

271
00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:59.275
You must eat it all.

272
00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:00.646
I will.

273
00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:08.015

00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:34.975
What are they up to?

278
00:20:47.426 --> 00:20:48.426
Hey.

00:20:49.196 --> 00:20:50.356
Where are you going?

280
00:20:50.965 --> 00:20:53.025
Dad's watching baduk. I want to watch soccer.

281
00:20:58.336 --> 00:21:00.336
Stop going upstairs.

282
00:21:00.336 --> 00:21:03.075
- Why? - You don't need to know why.

283
00:21:03.106 --> 00:21:06.545
Whatever the reason, stop going upstairs.

284
00:21:06.706 --> 00:21:08.446
I need to watch soccer.

285
00:21:09.876 --> 00:21:11.215
I will...

286
00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:13.646
get you your own TV.

287
00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:16.186
- Promise? - Yes.

288
00:21:16.356 --> 00:21:18.386
I'll buy it online before you change your mind.

Why go to a cinema if we'll sit apart?

I don't care.

You have to be careful. And that means I do too.

- I'm fine. You put it on. - Your lips are all chapped.

Go home now.

- You won't find a scoop there. - Okay.

299
00:22:20.586 --> 00:22:23.015
Okay, then. Bye.

300
00:22:23.856 --> 00:22:25.025

We have 10 minutes left.

312

Go first.

313
00:25:57.805 --> 00:26:00.035
Wasn't it cold in here? You should've turned on the heater.

314
00:26:00.136 --> 00:26:03.206
- I'm fine. - Wasn't that fun?

But I couldn't see the ending.

Did DiCaprio die? He did, didn't he?

319

- No. - Then did he live?

320
00:26:16.015 --> 00:26:17.626
Did he successfully get his revenge?

321
00:26:17.926 --> 00:26:19.586

Yes, what is it? Tell me.

340
00:29:16.235 --> 00:29:17.965
This is way too interesting.

(Children of 20th Century/20th Century Boy & Girl)

342
00:30:06.315 --> 00:30:09.785
Wow, someone might think he's your son-in-law.

343
00:30:09.785 --> 00:30:12.055
Ji Won, do you have good news?

344
00:30:12.055 --> 00:30:15.626
Let's wait and see if you two are playing house.

345
00:30:15.626 --> 00:30:16.795
Will you two get married?

346
00:30:16.795 --> 00:30:19.096
I thought your career would take off thanks to Jin Jin.

347
00:30:19.096 --> 00:30:20.765
What kind of a soap opera is this?

348
00:30:20.765 --> 00:30:22.735
Jin Jin, you know everything about me,

349
00:30:22.735 --> 00:30:25.035
but I don't really know anything about you.

350
00:30:25.035 --> 00:30:26.765
I really am a success, aren't I?

351
00:30:26.765 --> 00:30:30.235
This is huge. It'll make the headlines.
