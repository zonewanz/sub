1
00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:14.314
When are you coming home?

2
00:00:15.113 --> 00:00:16.113
I'm almost there.

3
00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:21.454
Oh, dear.

4
00:00:23.224 --> 00:00:25.093
- Are you coming home from work? - Yes.

5
00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.663
- Did you throw away the trash? - Yes.

6
00:00:28.193 --> 00:00:29.533
Did you eat?

7
00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:32.033
Yes, I did.

8
00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:41.943
Ji Won.

9
00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:44.614
Let's eat.

10
00:00:45.014 --> 00:00:46.913
You're so skinny.

11
00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.154
Okay.

12
00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:00.063
Here.

13
00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:03.233
See? Isn't it great to have home-cooked meals?

14
00:01:03.493 --> 00:01:05.033
I feel better too.

15
00:01:05.404 --> 00:01:07.274
Even if you're really busy,

16
00:01:07.404 --> 00:01:09.673
come down, and eat here.

17
00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.044
Okay, I will.

18
00:01:11.044 --> 00:01:13.503
Don't just say it.

19
00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:17.544
Should we invite people on 13th and 14th floors too?

20
00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:19.244
That sounds good. I'll look into it.

21
00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.884
Sure. Eat.

22
00:01:21.884 --> 00:01:23.214
Okay. Thank you for the meal.

23
00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:27.154
By the way, I'm really sorry.

24
00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:28.154
Why?

25
00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.264
I have to go to the store.

26
00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:34.934
I want to stay until you're done eating,

27
00:01:34.934 --> 00:01:37.503
but my husband wants me right now.

28
00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:40.063
- You should go, then. - Okay.

29
00:01:40.063 --> 00:01:43.134
Right. Leave Jin Jin alone.

30
00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:46.003
- Why? - I told her to come downstairs,

31
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.014
but she wanted to be left alone and hid beneath a blanket.

32
00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:51.483
- You know what she's like. - I do.

33
00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:54.914
Eat all you want. There's more rice in the cooker.

34
00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.014
- Okay. - Bye.

35
00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:57.554
- See you. - Sure.

36
00:01:57.824 --> 00:02:01.423
Leave whatever's left. I'll put everything away.

37
00:02:01.423 --> 00:02:02.923
- Okay. - Bye.

38
00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:06.524
Oh, and there's fruit in the fridge.

39
00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:08.333
- Eat that if you want. - Okay.

40
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.803
- See you. - Bye. Take care.

41
00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:35.854
Not again.

42
00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:39.124
I ran upstairs.

43
00:02:43.703 --> 00:02:46.164
- My present. - What?

44
00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:48.903
You said you'd give me something for working hard.

45
00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:51.544
Give me my present.

46
00:02:56.444 --> 00:02:57.483
There.

47
00:02:57.483 --> 00:02:59.044
- That's it? - Yes.

48
00:03:02.713 --> 00:03:05.483
I'll give you one too.

49
00:03:10.094 --> 00:03:11.264
That hurt.

(Episode 21)

53
00:03:29.014 --> 00:03:30.583
What did you do today?

54
00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:34.354
I worked. I read scripts.

55
00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:36.514
To see if there's anything worth starring in.

56
00:03:38.254 --> 00:03:40.453
- I wanted to know. - Know what?

57
00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:43.963
Whether you'd gotten up, gone swimming,

58
00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:47.294
eaten, what you ate, whether it was good,

59
00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:50.333
whether you thought of me when you ate, or wanted to eat together.

60
00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:55.703
- What? - It's so strange.

61
00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.203
- What is? - You're different.

62
00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:02.074
So what? Do you not like it?

63
00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:03.983
No, I like it.

64
00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:07.083
You almost made me upset.

65
00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:14.453
Shall we watch a movie later?

66
00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:16.593
I haven't watched the DiCaprio one yet.

67
00:04:18.893 --> 00:04:22.593
Some other time. I have something else to do tonight.

68
00:04:23.593 --> 00:04:26.134
At night? What?

69
00:04:26.134 --> 00:04:28.634
- Won't you play with me? - I want to.

70
00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.444
It's so that I can play with you.

71
00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:56.734
- Ji Won. - Hey.

72
00:04:57.504 --> 00:04:59.434
- Soju, please. - Okay.

73
00:05:00.804 --> 00:05:03.674
How badly did you want soju?

74
00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:07.244
This is an excuse. I wanted to see you.

75
00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:10.583
That's nice to hear whenever you say it.

76
00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:12.314
Cheers.

77
00:05:16.653 --> 00:05:18.723
- Did you get back safely from Jeju? - Of course.

78
00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:21.054
- Jin Jin too? - Yes.

79
00:05:22.424 --> 00:05:24.324
It couldn't have been easy...

80
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.864
shooting in the cold before she'd fully recovered.

81
00:05:27.864 --> 00:05:31.064
- Take good care of her. - Okay.

82
00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:37.374
Chul Min, you know...

83
00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:38.944
Just a moment.

84
00:05:40.143 --> 00:05:41.314
Jeong Eun.

85
00:05:41.314 --> 00:05:44.343
Lee Chul Min, Lee Chul Min, Lee Chul Min.

86
00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:46.744
- What is it now? - Just listen.

87
00:05:46.843 --> 00:05:50.083
One, a genius triple-board surgeon whose into thoracic surgery,

88
00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.453
neurosurgery, and emergency medicine.

89
00:05:52.783 --> 00:05:56.054
Two, a rich public defender who's an eighth-generation only son.

90
00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:59.924
Three, a criminal profiler with an IQ of 160 who...

91
00:05:59.924 --> 00:06:00.934
feels no emotions.

92
00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:02.264
What do you want to be?

93
00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:06.163
- Why are you so excited? - Those scripts are going around.

94
00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:09.234
The chief said he'd try to get us a role.

95
00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:11.473
He liked you on "We Got Married".

96
00:06:11.473 --> 00:06:13.444
You should act with Sa Jin Jin.

97
00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:16.674
Not Jin Jin again. I said no.

98
00:06:16.674 --> 00:06:19.413
The chief likes you.

99
00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:22.783
- What do you want me to say? - He's just being polite.

100
00:06:22.884 --> 00:06:26.023
No. I trust the chief.

101
00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:30.324
He has a temper, but he's loyal.

102
00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:33.764
I'm so pleased. All that groveling paid off.

103
00:06:33.764 --> 00:06:35.333
I'll stay loyal to him forever.

104
00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:38.703
You'll end up badmouthing anyone in broadcasting soon.

105
00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:40.903
Do you have to burst my bubble?

106
00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:43.333
I'm not bursting anything.

107
00:06:44.074 --> 00:06:47.143
Jeong Eun, let's not take this too seriously.

108
00:06:47.244 --> 00:06:49.473
Why do things that will only hurt us?

109
00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:52.083
I told you to treat everyone like a furnace.

110
00:06:52.384 --> 00:06:53.384
A furnace?

111
00:06:53.384 --> 00:06:56.384
Stay close enough but not too close.

112
00:06:57.054 --> 00:06:58.353
Chul Min.

113
00:06:58.783 --> 00:07:01.023
You'll be named a saint when you die.

114
00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:02.223
Fine.

115
00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:07.634
Did you get some good news?

116
00:07:08.163 --> 00:07:11.304
Jeong Eun keeps getting too excited for her own good.

117
00:07:11.603 --> 00:07:14.533
You seem to be quite popular these days.

118
00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:15.804
"We Got Married"?

119
00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:19.004
I owe it all to Jin Jin.

120
00:07:19.504 --> 00:07:21.213
I'm so grateful.

121
00:07:22.814 --> 00:07:26.444
Why should you be grateful? You earned the spotlight.

122
00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:29.514
You're the only one in the world who says that.

123
00:07:30.624 --> 00:07:32.853
You and Jeong Eun, I mean.

124
00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:35.223
Wait, no.

125
00:07:35.223 --> 00:07:37.963
You, Jeong Eun, and Jin Jin.

126
00:07:42.694 --> 00:07:45.504
Oh, what did you want to say?

127
00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:47.973
- What? - You called me over.

128
00:07:49.504 --> 00:07:52.903
Oh, the soju tastes great tonight.

129
00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:55.213
Especially because I'm with you.

130
00:07:57.484 --> 00:07:59.043
Let's drink up, then.

131
00:08:23.473 --> 00:08:26.174
(Taxi stand)

132
00:08:32.184 --> 00:08:35.053
(Available)

133
00:08:35.053 --> 00:08:37.053
- Hello. - Hello.

134
00:08:37.053 --> 00:08:40.354
I have a thing for women with nice ankles.

135
00:09:00.004 --> 00:09:01.974
Hey. Get in.

136
00:09:04.714 --> 00:09:06.584
You don't sound cool at all.

137
00:09:20.264 --> 00:09:24.964
Your car isn't at all welcoming.

138
00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.933
It lacks humanism.

139
00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:31.073
- Why are you here? - Me?

140
00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:34.143
This and that. A few reasons.

141
00:09:34.514 --> 00:09:37.313
- Like what? - Well...

142
00:09:37.984 --> 00:09:39.943
I was passing Kimpo plains,

143
00:09:39.943 --> 00:09:43.413
and I found myself at the airport. Whom does an airport remind me of?

144
00:09:43.413 --> 00:09:45.254
You, the best flight attendant ever.

145
00:09:45.254 --> 00:09:48.553
I had a feeling that you'd have landed right about now.

146
00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:50.893
I'm like a cricket with feelers.

147
00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:52.224
Do crickets have feelers?

148
00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:55.663
Anyway, that's how I ended up here and...

149
00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:58.063
You can tell in 0.1 second...

150
00:09:58.063 --> 00:10:01.533
whether or not you can kiss the guy.

151
00:10:04.004 --> 00:10:05.874
That's not normal.

152
00:10:05.874 --> 00:10:08.313
It's on my route home.

153
00:10:08.313 --> 00:10:10.543
I can always drop you off.

154
00:10:14.053 --> 00:10:15.614
That's impossible.

155
00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:18.484
Do you think that makes sense?

156
00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:22.423
Does it not make sense? Really?

157
00:10:31.334 --> 00:10:33.433
Yes. I think I'm crazy.

158
00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:36.773
Crazy, totally crazy, a complete nutcase.

159
00:10:37.244 --> 00:10:40.614
Yes, you're right. I'm a nutcase.

160
00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:22.384
Open your door.

161
00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:57.624
What if I get fat like a sweet bun?

162
00:12:03.494 --> 00:12:05.764
Don't worry. You're pretty no matter what.

163
00:13:16.134 --> 00:13:18.264
Jin Jin, come eat.

164
00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:20.903
Where did she go?

165
00:13:25.803 --> 00:13:27.143
You're so ugly.

166
00:13:27.714 --> 00:13:29.173
Would that help?

167
00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:33.653
You don't know a thing about soft and flawless skin of a woman.

168
00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:35.114
I don't just know a thing about their skin.

169
00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:36.454
I know everything.

170
00:13:36.754 --> 00:13:39.323
I'm pretty cool, you know. I'm very popular.

171
00:13:39.323 --> 00:13:40.323
What's he saying?

172
00:13:42.224 --> 00:13:43.323
Hey, Min Ho.

173
00:13:51.104 --> 00:13:52.234
How's this?

174
00:13:54.374 --> 00:13:56.604
- It's weird. - It's too gloomy, right?

175
00:13:56.604 --> 00:13:57.773
Give me one second.

176
00:14:02.514 --> 00:14:03.573
What about this one?

177
00:14:05.214 --> 00:14:06.484
The one before was better.

178
00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:08.584
This is too fancy, right? Give me one more second.

179
00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:13.754
- What do you think? - That's so-so.

180
00:14:14.393 --> 00:14:17.224
So please stop asking this to a family member.

181
00:14:17.893 --> 00:14:19.193
Just come eat.

182
00:14:25.063 --> 00:14:26.104
All right.

183
00:14:28.204 --> 00:14:30.573
Isn't this great? It's so homey now.

184
00:14:30.844 --> 00:14:33.773
Thanks to Ji Won, our house is full.

185
00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.913
Ji Won, be careful because it's hot, but eat a lot.

186
00:14:38.084 --> 00:14:40.984
It's fish cake made with fish caught in Jeju Island.

187
00:14:40.984 --> 00:14:42.014
Okay.

188
00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:44.124
You talk about no one else but Ji Won.

189
00:14:44.254 --> 00:14:46.724
Ji Won, you might as well pack up and move in.

190
00:14:47.823 --> 00:14:50.663
Just get married to her. You look like their son-in-law.

191
00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:52.823
Mom, get the water ready, and Dad, go get a chicken for a party.

192
00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:55.634
Of course, I can give Ji Won a hundred chickens.

193
00:14:56.594 --> 00:14:59.663
Why would you get a chicken? And don't call him your son-in-law.

194
00:14:59.663 --> 00:15:02.273
And you. Stop saying that.

195
00:15:02.273 --> 00:15:04.744
If you say that again, I won't let you live.

196
00:15:04.744 --> 00:15:06.874
Unbelievable. Why are you all angry?

197
00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:08.474
Ji Won should be the one who's angry.

198
00:15:08.573 --> 00:15:09.913
Look at how he's fine.

199
00:15:10.114 --> 00:15:11.683
It doesn't sound so bad to me.

200
00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:20.494
Wait, do you...

201
00:15:26.923 --> 00:15:28.364
still get beaten up by her?

202
00:15:29.063 --> 00:15:30.264
You little...

203
00:15:42.288 --> 00:15:45.520

204
00:15:59.523 --> 00:16:00.864
- Ji Won. - Yes?

205
00:16:00.864 --> 00:16:02.933
Are you recycling the garbage all right?

206
00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:05.364
Do you want me to come and clean your house?

207
00:16:05.504 --> 00:16:09.403
You need to clean up your fridge and your sink too.

208
00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:12.244
Oh, it's okay. I barely ever use the fridge and the sink.

209
00:16:12.244 --> 00:16:14.073
You still need to clean them up.

210
00:16:14.514 --> 00:16:17.584
Anyway, forget about it. I'll manage.

211
00:16:18.443 --> 00:16:19.484
Okay.

212
00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:32.063
- She's here. - So what?

213
00:16:34.033 --> 00:16:35.234
Stop.

214
00:16:35.634 --> 00:16:37.704
Right, Jin Jin.

215
00:16:37.704 --> 00:16:40.803
Do you have the autographs? I'm going to a reunion in two days.

216
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.234
I need 50 of them.

217
00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:43.773
- I'll do it. - Goodness.

218
00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:46.573
You never listen when I ask you the first time.

219
00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:49.313
- I'll do it. - My goodness.

220
00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.084
Goodness.

221
00:17:00.393 --> 00:17:01.594
- What? - What?

222
00:17:01.594 --> 00:17:02.653
What is it?

223
00:17:03.423 --> 00:17:05.664
Oh, what's for dinner today?

224
00:17:05.664 --> 00:17:06.664
What?

225
00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:10.504
What do you want? Do you want anything?

226
00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:12.434
I want pork cutlet.

227
00:17:12.434 --> 00:17:14.434
Do you like pork cutlet that much?

228
00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:15.434
Yes.

229
00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.543
My gosh, okay.

230
00:17:33.123 --> 00:17:34.654
I can give you a ride.

231
00:17:34.654 --> 00:17:38.194
It's okay. I'm going to the office after I swim.

232
00:17:38.194 --> 00:17:39.664
- Do you have work to do? - Yes.

233
00:17:40.264 --> 00:17:42.293
Then have a great day.

234
00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:43.863
Remember to eat well.

235
00:17:44.833 --> 00:17:45.904
You too.

236
00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:47.504
Let's go.

237
00:17:53.813 --> 00:17:54.873
Ji Won.

238
00:17:56.474 --> 00:17:57.543
What should I do...

239
00:17:58.043 --> 00:17:59.914
about "We Got Married"?

240
00:18:12.323 --> 00:18:14.494
I want to stop shooting "We Got Married".

241
00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:16.033
Me too. I want to stop too.

242
00:18:16.694 --> 00:18:18.264
What will you do with those?

243
00:18:20.004 --> 00:18:22.573
Gosh, you always take things a bit too far.

244
00:18:24.373 --> 00:18:26.204
Why do you always do everything so diligently?

245
00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:28.813
Who would ever shoot "We Got Married" as sincerely as you?

246
00:18:29.414 --> 00:18:31.644
They want you and Anthony to be married for life.

247
00:18:31.783 --> 00:18:33.654
You're banned from getting a divorce.

248
00:18:33.654 --> 00:18:35.883
To be frank, it's not the time...

249
00:18:36.154 --> 00:18:39.023
for you to be so happily married with Anthony, you fool.

250
00:18:39.053 --> 00:18:40.994
- It's not that... - That's not everything.

251
00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:43.293
They sent over boxes of adult sex toys.

252
00:18:43.293 --> 00:18:46.264
I'm so angry. I won't let those perverts live.

253
00:18:46.264 --> 00:18:47.734
I wasn't the one who wanted to do this.

254
00:18:47.863 --> 00:18:51.533
You made me do it. This all began with a prank cam without asking me.

255
00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:53.234
I apologize.

256
00:18:55.204 --> 00:18:56.434
But I had no choice.

257
00:18:56.573 --> 00:18:58.144
I needed a way out too.

258
00:19:02.944 --> 00:19:05.043
Is there anything else you aren't telling me?

259
00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:08.353
Did you ever meet Anthony privately?

260
00:19:08.353 --> 00:19:11.053
He's too busy for that. Why would he meet me?

261
00:19:11.053 --> 00:19:13.053
You still don't get it, do you?

262
00:19:15.494 --> 00:19:16.894
It's not just about the show.

263
00:19:16.964 --> 00:19:18.623
You have to be careful...

264
00:19:19.394 --> 00:19:21.894
in your everyday life. You do know that, don't you?

265
00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:26.404
Let's not make this into a big deal, okay?

266
00:19:27.674 --> 00:19:30.174
(Lawyer Jang Young Shim)

267
00:19:33.744 --> 00:19:35.313
- Lawyer Jang. - Yes?

268
00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:37.613
If you're finished with Hanbit Construction's contract...

269
00:19:37.613 --> 00:19:39.444
from last Saturday, please pass it onto me.

270
00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:43.454
And check the personal turnaround documents for Mr. Yang once again.

271
00:19:43.454 --> 00:19:44.583
Okay.

272
00:19:48.323 --> 00:19:51.424
They aren't urgent, so you can go home early today.

273
00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:57.764
Right, you probably got your monthly pay this afternoon.

274
00:19:58.133 --> 00:19:59.664
Great job this month.

275
00:20:01.504 --> 00:20:02.934
Thank you.

276
00:20:07.343 --> 00:20:09.014
Lawyer Kang, by any chance,

277
00:20:09.873 --> 00:20:11.283
do you want some fried chicken?

278
00:20:11.984 --> 00:20:13.383
Aren't you hungry?

279
00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.583
Since I got...

280
00:20:18.724 --> 00:20:20.394
my monthly pay today,

281
00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:24.123
I'll buy. Do you want to go to the pub out front?

282
00:20:29.793 --> 00:20:31.863
Do you like beer?

283
00:20:32.303 --> 00:20:34.934
I like the atmosphere. I like having drinks with friends.

284
00:20:38.974 --> 00:20:40.543
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

285
00:20:42.273 --> 00:20:43.944
- Cheers. - Okay.

286
00:20:56.793 --> 00:20:59.123
You seem like a good drinker.

287
00:21:00.224 --> 00:21:03.734
Oh, I'm not that good among my friends...

288
00:21:04.234 --> 00:21:05.934
- You can relax. - Okay.

289
00:21:16.543 --> 00:21:18.083
Work isn't easy, is it?

290
00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:23.383
I'm sorry that I'm sloppy in many ways.

291
00:21:23.684 --> 00:21:26.383
Well, everyone can be sloppy at work.

292
00:21:26.484 --> 00:21:27.623
Cheers.

293
00:21:46.343 --> 00:21:49.174
You're quite a drinker.

294
00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:50.484
Have another glass.

295
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.613
- Can we have another glass of beer? - Coming up.

296
00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:07.563
Mr. Kang.

297
00:22:08.494 --> 00:22:10.434
I think you're drunk.

298
00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:12.603
Shall we call it a day?

299
00:22:13.303 --> 00:22:15.633
- Pardon? - Should we go home?

300
00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:18.744
I'm okay.

301
00:22:20.414 --> 00:22:23.914
You're a heavy drinker.

302
00:22:24.244 --> 00:22:26.113
- Let's go home after this one. - Okay.

303
00:22:26.113 --> 00:22:28.014
- No rush. - Okay.

304
00:22:39.994 --> 00:22:42.833
Mr. Kang.

305
00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:44.964
Let's go home. Oh, dear.

306
00:22:45.133 --> 00:22:46.934
- Lawyer Jang. - Yes.

307
00:22:46.934 --> 00:22:48.704
- Jang Young Shim. - Yes.

308
00:22:48.704 --> 00:22:50.174
Sit down.

309
00:22:53.174 --> 00:22:54.444
Please speak.

310
00:22:54.444 --> 00:22:57.514
Are you going to be five minutes late again?

311
00:22:58.714 --> 00:23:01.583
I'm not late these days.

312
00:23:01.583 --> 00:23:05.323
So are you going to be late again?

313
00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:07.523
I won't be late.

314
00:23:07.523 --> 00:23:09.023
- I trust you. - Sorry?

315
00:23:09.023 --> 00:23:12.593
I trust you, Lawyer Jang.

316
00:23:16.593 --> 00:23:19.863
- Taxi! - Mr. Kang.

317
00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:30.283
Don't be late, Young Shim! Okay?

318
00:23:35.883 --> 00:23:38.123
I'm sober now.

319
00:23:57.144 --> 00:24:01.773
When you've known each other for a long time,

320
00:24:02.014 --> 00:24:03.944
can you develop feelings for them?

321
00:24:03.944 --> 00:24:05.343
- No. - No.

322
00:24:11.023 --> 00:24:13.053
Why? Did something happen?

323
00:24:13.184 --> 00:24:14.793
Nothing happened.

324
00:24:14.793 --> 00:24:17.164
I swore not to get married.

325
00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:20.863
You should all swear it too.

326
00:24:21.533 --> 00:24:22.764
- Young Shim. - Yes?

327
00:24:23.434 --> 00:24:26.464
- Swear you won't get married. - Okay. I won't get married.

328
00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:29.103
Okay. Welcome to the club.

329
00:24:30.273 --> 00:24:32.644
- Jin Jin. - Yes.

330
00:24:32.644 --> 00:24:34.773
Join the club.

331
00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:36.214
Okay.

332
00:24:36.214 --> 00:24:39.744
She'll join for sure. Right?

333
00:24:40.954 --> 00:24:42.154
Why are we doing this?

334
00:24:42.154 --> 00:24:45.754
You're one of us, so you have to join.

335
00:24:45.754 --> 00:24:48.954
Get a document notarized so that we don't get any traitors.

336
00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:51.394
- Okay. - What happens...

337
00:24:51.394 --> 00:24:53.664
- once I swear not to get married? - What do you mean?

338
00:24:53.664 --> 00:24:56.863
We'll just be like this. We'll have each other even when we age.

339
00:24:56.964 --> 00:25:00.773
Okay. Let's go to a retirement home and enjoy life.

340
00:25:00.873 --> 00:25:02.033
It's all good.

341
00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:04.343
Ji Won, you have to join too.

342
00:25:04.444 --> 00:25:06.644
- I'm not joining. - Why not?

343
00:25:06.644 --> 00:25:08.514
- Are you seeing someone? - Are you?

344
00:25:09.244 --> 00:25:12.014
He doesn't have anybody. He's got nothing.

345
00:25:12.014 --> 00:25:14.014
You're automatically in.

346
00:25:14.353 --> 00:25:15.813
Goodness.

347
00:25:17.283 --> 00:25:18.754
Oh, dear.

348
00:25:26.023 --> 00:25:28.964
- Guys, I need to use the bathroom. - Okay.

349
00:25:32.533 --> 00:25:34.303
Me too.

350
00:25:42.744 --> 00:25:46.444
What now? Why are you following me?

351
00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:48.283
I'm going to the bathroom too.

352
00:25:48.283 --> 00:25:50.254
Why did you sit next to me?

353
00:25:50.254 --> 00:25:52.454
- Why did you hand me the chicken? - Sorry?

354
00:25:52.454 --> 00:25:56.154
I can eat by myself. And why did you give me the tissue?

355
00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:58.724
I always do that.

356
00:26:00.633 --> 00:26:03.833
Anyways, what if those two notice?

357
00:26:03.833 --> 00:26:05.833
Notice what?

358
00:26:06.764 --> 00:26:07.934
I don't know.

359
00:26:13.343 --> 00:26:14.573
It's cold.

360
00:26:14.843 --> 00:26:17.283
- That was funny. - No way.

361
00:26:17.383 --> 00:26:20.313
Ji Won, aren't you going to the convenience store today?

362
00:26:20.414 --> 00:26:22.383
I'm not. I'm going straight home today.

363
00:26:22.383 --> 00:26:25.353
I'm going home too. I miss my mom so much.

364
00:26:25.353 --> 00:26:27.523
That's not what you said before.

365
00:26:27.523 --> 00:26:29.623
Why would you ask for trouble?

366
00:26:29.623 --> 00:26:32.863
Hey, do you know how it feels to live alone?

367
00:26:32.863 --> 00:26:35.764
You get so lonely and gloomy.

368
00:26:35.764 --> 00:26:37.434
It's like a deep, deep ocean...

369
00:26:37.434 --> 00:26:39.004
- Fine. Come. - Let's go.

370
00:26:39.004 --> 00:26:40.333
- See you. - Bye.

371
00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:41.434
Bye.

372
00:26:46.974 --> 00:26:48.073
Let's go.

373
00:26:58.083 --> 00:27:00.293
Don't do that. What's wrong with you?

374
00:27:01.593 --> 00:27:04.994
- Are you embarrassed? - What's that? Don't.

375
00:27:05.293 --> 00:27:07.494
Why? There's nobody here.

376
00:27:07.494 --> 00:27:09.633
What's wrong with you?

377
00:27:14.303 --> 00:27:15.404
Did you see Ji Won?

378
00:27:15.404 --> 00:27:18.873
He was staring at Jin Jin the whole time.

379
00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:23.174
I'm going to die because I'm so lonely. That punk.

380
00:27:25.444 --> 00:27:27.654
Do you think they'll last more than three days this time?

381
00:27:27.654 --> 00:27:30.684
Who knows? It's them.

382
00:27:35.424 --> 00:27:37.224
When's the 100th day anniversary?

383
00:27:38.063 --> 00:27:40.293
February 13, 2018.

384
00:27:40.593 --> 00:27:41.734
What?

385
00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:43.533
Why?

386
00:27:43.863 --> 00:27:46.664
How do you know about Deputy Yoon's baby's anniversary?

387
00:27:47.004 --> 00:27:50.404
- What? - How do you know Deputy Yoon?

388
00:27:52.644 --> 00:27:54.573
How do you know him?

389
00:27:56.244 --> 00:27:58.843
Do you like joking with me that much?

390
00:27:58.843 --> 00:28:00.214
Does it make you happy?

391
00:28:00.984 --> 00:28:04.623
I wasn't joking with you. That was a compliment.

392
00:28:04.823 --> 00:28:07.254
You're so smart, Jin Jin.

393
00:28:07.254 --> 00:28:09.293
You're a genius.

394
00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:35.711
(Episode 22 will air shortly.)
