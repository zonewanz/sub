<i>[Andante]</i>

4
00:00:51.347 --> 00:00:53.490
Why wouldn't I be able to earn money?

5
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.311
I'm selling exam questions...

6
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:01.921
Anyway, I'll take care of everything.

7
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.402
Just consider me dead already.

<i>[Episode 9: You Are My Spring]</i>

9
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:27.790
Is it okay for him to continue studying?

10
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.293
It is too much for him,
but there are terminal patients like him.

11
00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:33.956
It's hard to understand, right?

12
00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:36.093
Anyway, good work you two.

13
00:01:36.093 --> 00:01:37.197
Bye now.

14
00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.293
We'll be late for school.

15
00:01:40.293 --> 00:01:42.358
Want to study all night
at my house tonight?

16
00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:44.745
Oh, are you finally coming out?

17
00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:47.417
I don't have the confidence
to finish up my studies.

18
00:01:47.417 --> 00:01:48.436
Sure.

19
00:01:48.436 --> 00:01:51.724
Mom won't think it's weird
if Shi Kyung studies with us.

20
00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:53.111
Okay. Let's hurry up.

21
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:54.474
- Are we late?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:55.899
- Oh no.
- Let's run.

23
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:11.240
Dad, do you know where I'm going today?

24
00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:15.692
Mom won't allow me to go if I tell her.

25
00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:18.075
So, I'm going to tell her
I'm sleeping over at Ga Ram's.

26
00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:23.200
Should I tell Ga Ram about it or not,
if I want to get away with this?

27
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.449
- <i>Hey, Lee Shi Kyung!</i>
- I'm going.

28
00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:27.576
<i>You're always late,
and you still haven't left yet?</i>

29
00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:30.051
Yeah, I shouldn't tell him.

30
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:31.733
I agree.

31
00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:34.054
Ga Ram has a bit of a big mouth.

32
00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:36.284
Okay, so I won't tell him then.

33
00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:44.954
Wait!

34
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.123
Try to get in.

35
00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:56.931
Teacher, I'm curious about something.

36
00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:59.181
- My grade for the ethics assessment...
- What about it?

37
00:02:59.181 --> 00:03:02.441
Why did I get a zero?
I gave an answer that day.

38
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.671
I shouldn't get a zero
if I gave an answer.

39
00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:08.800
<i>I'm asking a question
regarding my studies.</i>

40
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.342
- <i>Amazing.</i>
- Take the test again if you want.

41
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.901
Teacher!

42
00:03:17.112 --> 00:03:20.022
We're late because we had
to take a patient to the hospice.

43
00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:22.340
Why are you here?
You're late again?

44
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.185
You're late too, Trash.

45
00:03:26.252 --> 00:03:28.235
- Hurry up and get inside.
- Thank you.

46
00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.572
Teacher!

47
00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:43.280
Move.

48
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.158
I'm not telling you.

49
00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:57.288
Don't be that way. Tell me.

50
00:03:57.288 --> 00:03:59.598
Was Shi Kyung that bad?

51
00:03:59.598 --> 00:04:01.158
It wasn't that.

52
00:04:02.598 --> 00:04:04.468
It was the exact opposite.

53
00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:06.236
Then why did he get zero?

54
00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:09.185
I'm not going to tell you
if you're going to argue with me.

55
00:04:09.185 --> 00:04:13.194
No, I'm not arguing with you.
I'm just curious.

56
00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:16.197
If he was the opposite of bad,
that means he was pretty good.

57
00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:18.449
Why did he get zero?

58
00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:21.083
About Shi Kyung...

59
00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:24.372
he's very creative, but too emotional.

60
00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:28.322
I think he is right-brained
and not left-brained.

61
00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:30.901
Is being emotional a bad thing?

62
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:32.653
You're arguing with me, aren't you?

63
00:04:32.653 --> 00:04:34.572
Forget it if you're going
to be like that.

64
00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:37.778
No, no, no.
I'm not saying you're wrong.

65
00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.247
Continue speaking, please.

66
00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.663
So... I think Lee Shi Kyung
has some potential.

67
00:04:46.663 --> 00:04:49.226
I'm working on him, so just know that.

68
00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:50.514
Wait.

69
00:04:55.766 --> 00:04:57.134
So, he's trying to convince him?

70
00:05:02.307 --> 00:05:04.257
Mom, I'm going.

71
00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:05.966
I'll call you from Ga Ram's house.

72
00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:08.036
Shi Kyung, take this.

73
00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:10.548
Eat this while
you're studying with Ga Ram.

74
00:05:10.548 --> 00:05:12.206
Okay, I will.

75
00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:15.423
Will it be just you and Ga Ram?

76
00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:16.452
What?

77
00:05:17.963 --> 00:05:19.012
Well...

78
00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:22.428
you know my friend Bong Gu?

79
00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:24.497
He'll be there too.

80
00:05:25.255 --> 00:05:27.187
I'm only letting you go
because it's Ga Ram.

81
00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:29.514
Okay, I'm leaving now.

82
00:05:29.514 --> 00:05:30.533
Mom.

83
00:05:31.935 --> 00:05:32.971
Ga Ram.

84
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:35.456
I want to study all night here
with Ga Ram.

85
00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:37.276
Shi Kyung can study too.
That's okay, right?

86
00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:39.617
I thought you were going
to Ga Ram's house.

87
00:05:39.617 --> 00:05:40.658
What?

88
00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:45.709
<i>Oh. Seriously, Dad?</i>

89
00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:55.125
<i>I thought I would get away with it
if I didn't tell Ga Ram about it!</i>

90
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.139
<i>What is this?</i>

91
00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:03.384
<i>Yeah... study hard.</i>

92
00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:05.324
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

93
00:06:14.105 --> 00:06:15.187
Where are you going?

94
00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.098
Can't I even go to the bathroom?

95
00:06:44.798 --> 00:06:46.038
Here you go.

96
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.764
Have some snacks. You're hungry, right?

97
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.038
Where's Shi Kyung?

98
00:06:52.038 --> 00:06:55.252
He said he was going to the bathroom.
What's taking him so long?

99
00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:58.372
What are you talking about?
Your aunt is in the bathroom.

100
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.562
He ran off. He ran away.

101
00:07:03.543 --> 00:07:05.242
Oh, seriously!

102
00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:10.245
You're here?

103
00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:16.451
What about your dad?

104
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:18.410
He'll meet us there. Let's go.

105
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.004
I couldn't bring anything
because I was in a rush.

106
00:07:21.004 --> 00:07:22.105
It's okay.

107
00:07:22.105 --> 00:07:24.413
We just need to take the bus for a bit.

108
00:07:24.413 --> 00:07:25.523
Let's go.

109
00:07:32.444 --> 00:07:34.057
He's not picking up.

110
00:07:34.766 --> 00:07:37.076
Where could he have possibly gone?

111
00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:42.697
Why is it so noisy in here?

112
00:07:42.697 --> 00:07:44.846
I thought the kids were studying.

113
00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:46.406
Shi Kyung ran away.

114
00:07:46.406 --> 00:07:49.516
Ran away? Where to and who with?

115
00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:52.408
Does Shi Kyung have a friend
named Bong Gu?

116
00:07:52.408 --> 00:07:54.295
Bong Gu? No.

117
00:07:54.295 --> 00:07:56.146
There's no one named
Bong Gu in our class.

118
00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:01.175
He went to see Bom. It's Bom.

119
00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:03.286
Where could he have gone
this late at night?

120
00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:07.677
He is just like his father.

121
00:08:08.468 --> 00:08:09.877
What do you mean by that?

122
00:08:09.877 --> 00:08:14.774
When Shi Yoon was Shi Kyung's age,
he ran off one night with some girl.

123
00:08:14.774 --> 00:08:18.434
I was so upset about it.

124
00:08:18.434 --> 00:08:21.894
Shi Kyung's dad had
a girlfriend in high school?

125
00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:25.713
There was a girl
he couldn't live without.

126
00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:28.303
Later, she transferred
to Seoul or some place.

127
00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:34.437
When I see Shi Kyung and Bom,
I'm reminded of her.

128
00:08:34.437 --> 00:08:36.543
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

129
00:08:36.543 --> 00:08:38.774
I've never heard that story before.

130
00:08:39.712 --> 00:08:43.652
You're mistaken in thinking
you know everything about Shi Yoon.

131
00:08:43.652 --> 00:08:46.732
How could you know more than his mother?

132
00:08:47.802 --> 00:08:49.413
Leave him be.

133
00:08:49.413 --> 00:08:50.966
When kids are like this...

134
00:08:50.966 --> 00:08:55.378
their mother's words are like
the bark of a passing dog.

135
00:08:55.378 --> 00:09:00.957
Besides, you have to set a good example
if you want your kids to listen.

136
00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:02.317
Mother!

137
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.275
Your dad's not here yet?

138
00:09:46.476 --> 00:09:48.145
Sit down.

139
00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:50.083
- Me?
- Yes.

140
00:10:04.626 --> 00:10:06.660
It suits you.

141
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.677
Does it?

142
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:09.917
I feel awkward.

143
00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:12.631
I've never gone fishing before.

144
00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:17.138
That was always my dad's seat.

145
00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:19.788
He's running very late.

146
00:10:19.788 --> 00:10:22.158
My dad isn't coming.

147
00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:24.238
Actually, he can't come.

148
00:10:26.979 --> 00:10:32.054
He died a long time ago
in the hospice in this town.

149
00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:33.140
What?

150
00:10:36.277 --> 00:10:38.350
Why would you make up a lie like that?

151
00:10:39.227 --> 00:10:42.467
A lot of people
don't have dads, so why...

152
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:47.056
I came to this neighborhood alone.

153
00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:51.436
<i>This is the place where my dad spent
his last days, so that's why I came here.</i>

154
00:10:52.128 --> 00:10:54.927
<i>My dad passed away in the hospice.</i>

155
00:10:54.927 --> 00:10:58.197
<i>My mom remarried and grew tired of me.</i>

156
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.259
<i>I live here alone.</i>

157
00:11:01.304 --> 00:11:02.778
I couldn't go around saying that.

158
00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:04.529
You could say nothing.

159
00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:06.187
I did say nothing.

160
00:11:07.057 --> 00:11:09.341
If I hadn't met you...

161
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:11.812
I wouldn't have said anything to anyone.

162
00:11:12.948 --> 00:11:17.058
I look so shabby compared to you.

163
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.413
<i>Family and friends...</i>

164
00:11:21.427 --> 00:11:23.451
<i>you have so many people around you.</i>

165
00:11:24.798 --> 00:11:27.599
<i>Whenever I saw you
around all those people...</i>

166
00:11:29.259 --> 00:11:32.099
<i>I envied you, and I was afraid too.</i>

167
00:11:33.349 --> 00:11:36.908
I thought you might not like me
if you knew who I was.

168
00:11:36.908 --> 00:11:38.486
Have you ever lived alone before?

169
00:11:39.828 --> 00:11:44.847
Do you know how it feels to have
no one in the world protecting you?

170
00:11:46.932 --> 00:11:48.350
<i>Why did I lie?</i>

171
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.600
<i>Why did I survive like that?</i>

172
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:55.778
I'm not asking you to understand me.

173
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.873
Just do as your heart leads you.

174
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:04.562
Other than my dad...

175
00:12:05.716 --> 00:12:06.855
you're the first person.

176
00:12:07.515 --> 00:12:11.479
You worried about me and
told me not to do something.

177
00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:17.865
You approached me carefully,
and warmly held my hand.

178
00:12:20.892 --> 00:12:24.912
That's why I'm telling you all of this.

179
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:30.049
I prefer to hide my true self.

180
00:12:31.525 --> 00:12:32.900
But, I'm showing myself.

181
00:13:49.239 --> 00:13:50.239
Dad!

182
00:13:50.239 --> 00:13:52.702
We told him going outside
with anemia was dangerous.

183
00:13:52.702 --> 00:13:54.691
- Prepare the transfusion.
- Okay.

184
00:13:58.119 --> 00:13:59.535
I thought you were at Shi Kyung's.

185
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.927
It didn't work out that way.

186
00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:03.547
What happened?

187
00:14:03.547 --> 00:14:05.004
He tried to go to Seoul.

188
00:14:05.004 --> 00:14:07.008
He fainted and was brought back here.

189
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:11.383
There are no nurses to watch him,
so I'm worried about him.

190
00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:13.764
He should be okay, right?

191
00:14:13.764 --> 00:14:15.881
We can stay with him tonight.

192
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:16.889
What?

193
00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:21.039
We were planning on staying up
all night in your office anyway.

194
00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:23.032
All right. Okay, then.

195
00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:37.610
What are you doing here?

196
00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:40.399
You passed out.

197
00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:42.615
They said someone needed to be here.

198
00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:44.673
Get out.

199
00:14:46.236 --> 00:14:47.604
Get lost.

200
00:14:47.604 --> 00:14:49.830
Aren't you being a bit harsh?

201
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.465
Lee Shi Young.

202
00:14:51.465 --> 00:14:54.486
I was holding back because you're sick.

203
00:14:54.486 --> 00:14:57.385
Do you think we want to be here?

204
00:14:57.385 --> 00:14:58.846
You could try saying thank...

205
00:14:58.846 --> 00:15:02.663
Put my box back, and get lost.

206
00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.437
Hey, is something wrong?

207
00:15:18.437 --> 00:15:20.837
How could we not catch
a single fish all night?

208
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.208
It's strange. Dad used to catch a lot.

209
00:15:25.447 --> 00:15:29.099
You know... I don't know
if I've ever stayed out this late.

210
00:15:33.647 --> 00:15:34.918
What's your dream?

211
00:15:35.508 --> 00:15:36.957
- Dream?
- Yes.

212
00:15:36.957 --> 00:15:39.268
Not the job you want, but your dream.

213
00:15:39.268 --> 00:15:42.783
When people ask about one's dream,
kids confuse that with a job.

214
00:15:42.783 --> 00:15:46.339
I've never thought about it,
and I'm not good at anything.

215
00:15:47.143 --> 00:15:50.708
Ah... going to the Grand Canyon.

216
00:15:50.708 --> 00:15:55.519
I thought it was really funny when the
vice-principal told me collect cacti.

217
00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:57.788
Lately, I have these thoughts in my mind.

218
00:15:58.618 --> 00:16:00.942
What would it be like
to visit the Grand Canyon?

219
00:16:01.514 --> 00:16:02.890
It would be nice to go together.

220
00:16:03.522 --> 00:16:07.062
Let's go together!
I'll work hard to collect them.

221
00:16:07.062 --> 00:16:10.033
I'll voluntarily buy some
and earn double points.

222
00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:14.532
I think I know what you're good at.

223
00:16:14.532 --> 00:16:15.816
What's that?

224
00:16:15.816 --> 00:16:17.791
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

225
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.500
I just thought of your tombstone
inscription right at this moment.

226
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.972
Really? What is it?

227
00:16:25.972 --> 00:16:27.912
It's a secret. I'll tell you later.

228
00:16:27.912 --> 00:16:29.211
Don't cheat on it.

229
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.350
I'm going to.

230
00:16:33.384 --> 00:16:35.716
I've got something. I've got one!

231
00:16:35.716 --> 00:16:37.525
- What should I do?
- Reel it in.

232
00:16:37.525 --> 00:16:39.106
- Grab it.
- What do I do? How?

233
00:16:39.106 --> 00:16:40.758
- You have to grab it.
- It's too strong!

234
00:16:40.758 --> 00:16:42.479
- It's not working.
- Use your strength!

235
00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:45.038
What kind of fish is that strong?

236
00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:46.808
Is it a shark or something?

237
00:16:46.808 --> 00:16:48.870
Why would there be a shark here?

238
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.312
It's getting away!

239
00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:53.854
Wow!

240
00:16:53.854 --> 00:16:56.985
You're the unlucky, first fish
I've ever caught!

241
00:16:57.977 --> 00:16:59.798
Give it to your grandma.

242
00:16:59.798 --> 00:17:01.134
Thank her for pricking my finger.

243
00:17:02.927 --> 00:17:07.746
Your grandma pricked my finger for me
at the hospice when I was younger.

244
00:17:07.746 --> 00:17:09.059
Oh, really?

245
00:17:09.766 --> 00:17:12.847
She always gave me piggyback rides
and held me when she saw me.

246
00:17:12.847 --> 00:17:16.683
She did that for many children,
so she may not remember me.

247
00:17:16.683 --> 00:17:17.990
But, I remember her.

248
00:17:19.116 --> 00:17:23.386
I'm so happy that she turned out
to be your grandma.

249
00:17:30.607 --> 00:17:33.500
You are my spring.
(Bom means spring in Korean)

250
00:17:34.227 --> 00:17:37.727
That's what I would write
for your tombstone inscription.

251
00:17:38.996 --> 00:17:41.608
You are my spring.

252
00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:15.923
You!

253
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.001
Hey! Stand right there.

254
00:18:19.001 --> 00:18:20.030
Stop!

255
00:18:20.873 --> 00:18:22.722
Hey, get back here.

256
00:18:22.722 --> 00:18:25.717
You must take after your dad
doing something like this.

257
00:18:25.717 --> 00:18:28.362
Hey, stop! Hey, hey!

258
00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:31.061
Stop right there.

259
00:18:33.218 --> 00:18:37.553
As for the next semester's
hospice volunteer dates...

260
00:18:37.553 --> 00:18:40.573
Ms. Oh, you look pretty.

261
00:18:40.573 --> 00:18:42.570
You're looking brighter every day.

262
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.974
Does it suit me?

263
00:18:43.974 --> 00:18:46.011
It looks great.

264
00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:48.898
Someone suggested
a detailed guideline for me.

265
00:18:48.898 --> 00:18:51.223
Really? Who was that?

266
00:18:52.153 --> 00:18:53.240
<i>Me?</i>

267
00:18:57.731 --> 00:19:00.748
Ms. Oh, is this your first time
proctoring an exam?

268
00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:03.345
- Yes.
- You can overlook some things.

269
00:19:03.345 --> 00:19:05.759
But, you must catch cheaters.

270
00:19:32.653 --> 00:19:35.250
<i>[Write "Republic of Korea"
in Chinese characters.]</i>

271
00:19:49.635 --> 00:19:52.063
<i>[Repub]</i>
(Written in Chinese)

272
00:19:57.309 --> 00:20:00.592
<i>[Republic of Korea]</i>
(Written in Korean)

273
00:20:00.592 --> 00:20:04.163
A human trait that AI cannot do...

274
00:20:04.943 --> 00:20:07.826
This is supposed to be a discussion,
so how can I do it alone?

275
00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:09.923
Then, you will get a zero.

276
00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:13.540
At some point in his life,
every man's quandary...

277
00:20:15.487 --> 00:20:19.567
It is that he feels at odds with himself.

278
00:20:24.535 --> 00:20:25.770
Keep going.

279
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.102
Wondering what I'm good at?

280
00:20:30.893 --> 00:20:32.111
What is my dream?

281
00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:38.482
How do others perceive me?

282
00:20:40.121 --> 00:20:42.544
<i>[Gaon Hospice]</i>

283
00:20:45.569 --> 00:20:47.017
His back wages?

284
00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:51.788
He worked all night in between his
studies, and the boss refuses to pay him.

285
00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:54.324
It's too much.

286
00:20:54.324 --> 00:20:56.596
It's because he's in a hospice, right?

287
00:20:56.596 --> 00:20:58.346
I think so.

288
00:20:58.346 --> 00:21:00.875
Isn't there any way we can help him?

289
00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:04.103
Earlier, at the library...

290
00:21:04.103 --> 00:21:05.981
What?

291
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:10.201
I heard him say that he would
memorize the exam questions.

292
00:21:10.201 --> 00:21:12.371
Then sell them
to private academies for money.

293
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:13.451
What?

294
00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:16.633
<i>What can we do by going there?</i>

295
00:21:16.633 --> 00:21:19.332
That's what we should look into now.

296
00:21:19.332 --> 00:21:21.307
I don't know. Will we be much help?

297
00:21:21.307 --> 00:21:22.619
I'll go with you.

298
00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:24.601
Though, I don't know what I can do.

299
00:21:26.325 --> 00:21:27.954
Then, I'll show you the way in Seoul.

300
00:21:29.631 --> 00:21:32.574
You don't have to go.
There's nothing wrong with staying.

301
00:21:32.574 --> 00:21:34.144
You should only go if you want to.

302
00:21:34.144 --> 00:21:37.019
I'll come and hold a picket, at least.

303
00:21:37.019 --> 00:21:38.088
A picket for me too.

304
00:21:38.088 --> 00:21:40.771
I'll hold a picket too and wear a mask.

305
00:21:41.631 --> 00:21:42.707
Picket one here.

306
00:21:42.707 --> 00:21:44.265
- Picket two.
- Picket three.

307
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:48.590
- How about you, Shi Young?
- I'll come.

308
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.221
We shouldn't tell anyone about this,
not even the patient.

309
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:54.041
- Why?
- We don't know how it'll turn out.

310
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:55.329
Shi Kyung's right about that.

311
00:21:55.329 --> 00:21:57.384
The more people we have the better.

312
00:22:00.772 --> 00:22:04.250
So, we've all decided to go
meet his boss in person.

313
00:22:07.074 --> 00:22:09.744
And you want me to come too?

314
00:22:09.744 --> 00:22:11.240
Yes, come with us.

315
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.682
Back in junior high,
you couldn't stand seeing injustice.

316
00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:18.632
Have you gone crazy too,
hanging around that crazy punk?

317
00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:33.315
Eom Yong Gi.

318
00:22:36.195 --> 00:22:37.740
What brings you here?

319
00:22:39.912 --> 00:22:43.094
Did you... want to say something to me?

320
00:22:49.104 --> 00:22:50.903
Choose one of the two.

321
00:22:50.903 --> 00:22:53.695
- What is it? I need to know...
- Just choose one.

322
00:22:53.695 --> 00:22:55.623
Just choose one.

323
00:23:02.344 --> 00:23:03.580
Oh! It's a circle.

324
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.321
What does it mean?
Does a circle mean something good?

325
00:23:06.321 --> 00:23:07.423
That I don't know.

326
00:23:21.108 --> 00:23:23.890
<i>[Pay his wages!] [Corrupt Boss]</i>

327
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.339
<i>[Corrupt Business] [Why did you do it?]</i>

328
00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:30.851
<i>[Back wages...]</i>

329
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:42.510
Aren't you kids hungry? Go out and eat.

330
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:47.349
We aren't leaving until
you pay his back wages.

331
00:23:47.349 --> 00:23:49.799
I am not the owner of this place!

332
00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:53.790
I'm just an employee here
like Moon whatever guy.

333
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.384
What do you expect me to do?

334
00:23:55.384 --> 00:23:57.559
We never told you
his last name was Moon.

335
00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:59.750
We just said he was
a part-time employee.

336
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.288
Just be quiet!

337
00:24:01.288 --> 00:24:03.703
You can live here for all I care.

338
00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:06.453
I could report you all
for obstructing my business.

339
00:24:06.453 --> 00:24:09.104
Where did you country bumpkins
crawl in from anyway?

340
00:24:09.104 --> 00:24:13.487
Mister, do you think we don't know you're
doing this because he's in a hospice?

341
00:24:13.487 --> 00:24:15.086
What kind of adult are you?

342
00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.352
You little...

343
00:24:17.491 --> 00:24:19.270
You better be quiet!

344
00:24:30.596 --> 00:24:31.853
Now, who are you?

345
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.965
Look at you. You've seen
a lot TV dramas, huh?

346
00:24:44.346 --> 00:24:46.903
Is this real gas? It's water, right?

347
00:24:47.821 --> 00:24:48.862
Light it.

348
00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:51.534
Try lighting it!

349
00:24:52.364 --> 00:24:55.809
I don't think I can hold back any longer.

350
00:24:55.809 --> 00:24:56.901
Here.

351
00:24:58.758 --> 00:25:00.438
This is real gas here.

352
00:25:02.623 --> 00:25:05.585
- Should we all die together?
- Whoa!

353
00:25:05.585 --> 00:25:08.296
Huh? Huh?

354
00:25:08.296 --> 00:25:09.384
Huh?

355
00:25:10.015 --> 00:25:11.674
I told you the owner isn't here.

356
00:25:12.434 --> 00:25:14.545
Do my words seem empty to you?

357
00:25:14.545 --> 00:25:16.276
Who do you think you all are?

358
00:25:16.276 --> 00:25:18.824
Are you prosecutors? Are you cops?

359
00:25:18.824 --> 00:25:21.844
You are nothing but
a bunch of little kids.

360
00:25:21.844 --> 00:25:24.005
Have you no fear?

361
00:25:24.005 --> 00:25:25.412
Huh!

362
00:25:30.136 --> 00:25:31.795
We're here, Boss.

363
00:25:32.525 --> 00:25:34.463
Yes, this is our district.

364
00:25:34.463 --> 00:25:37.203
Yes, I know the owner very well.
Should we screw him over?

365
00:25:37.203 --> 00:25:38.974
Well, I...

366
00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:41.615
<i>Don't be too rough.</i>

367
00:25:41.615 --> 00:25:43.619
<i>Just get the back wages right away.</i>

368
00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:47.086
Yes, he's very corrupt.
There are many bad rumors about him.

369
00:25:47.086 --> 00:25:48.892
I'll use this opportunity
to stomp him out.

370
00:25:48.892 --> 00:25:50.967
<i>You can sort that out.</i>

371
00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:53.897
<i>Once the money has been
deposited, I'm out of it.</i>

372
00:25:53.897 --> 00:25:55.176
All right, Boss.

373
00:25:55.176 --> 00:25:57.138
Yes, goodbye, Boss.

374
00:26:01.606 --> 00:26:03.785
How much was it?

375
00:26:03.785 --> 00:26:05.345
You know the bank, right?

376
00:26:05.345 --> 00:26:10.451
- The bank account number...
- 526-04-418643.

377
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:11.608
The wifi...

378
00:26:12.675 --> 00:26:13.926
It's working.

379
00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:15.425
Don't stress me out.

380
00:26:16.267 --> 00:26:17.343
<i>The bank account number...</i>

381
00:26:17.343 --> 00:26:21.885
<i>525-04-418643.</i>

382
00:26:21.885 --> 00:26:23.107
<i>Don't stress me out.</i>

383
00:26:23.107 --> 00:26:24.702
<i>The wifi...</i>

384
00:26:24.702 --> 00:26:25.982
<i>It's working.</i>

385
00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:34.134
It has been deposited. I confirmed it.

386
00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:35.894
Take a look at your account.

387
00:26:50.918 --> 00:26:54.150
<font color="#80ffff">[DF Ver] E09 Andante "You Are My Spring"</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

388
00:27:08.202 --> 00:27:09.891
<i>You may be my spring...</i>

389
00:27:11.453 --> 00:27:13.153
<i>But, all of us...</i>

390
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:17.359
<i>can be someone's warm spring.</i>

391
00:27:19.502 --> 00:27:22.549
You want to donate a bathing machine?

392
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:23.876
Yes.

393
00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:26.878
I heard there was a bathing machine
that makes it easier for patients.

394
00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:28.787
The doctor mentioned it.

395
00:27:28.787 --> 00:27:33.680
- That is...
- I find bathing most difficult, too.

396
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.828
Please accept it.

397
00:27:34.828 --> 00:27:37.015
- Still, no.
- I have always...

398
00:27:38.133 --> 00:27:39.967
only ever thought of myself.

399
00:27:40.503 --> 00:27:42.163
I only studied for my own benefit.

400
00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:48.454
I want to give a little
something back to others.

401
00:27:56.884 --> 00:27:59.675
Everyone will be so happy.

402
00:27:59.675 --> 00:28:01.035
I can just picture it.

403
00:28:03.605 --> 00:28:05.423
Oh yeah.

404
00:28:05.423 --> 00:28:08.605
My son wanted me to ask you something.

405
00:28:08.605 --> 00:28:12.023
The orange...
why do you always carry one?

406
00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:14.980
Because it has a lot of vitamin C.

407
00:28:16.173 --> 00:28:18.361
I always wanted a good seat in class.

408
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:22.733
So, I would study on top of a box
early in the morning in the streets.

409
00:28:22.733 --> 00:28:25.182
I would always take an orange
back with me.

410
00:28:27.173 --> 00:28:29.471
They said vitamin C was good for fatigue.

411
00:28:30.753 --> 00:28:32.791
I can't even eat it now.

412
00:28:33.622 --> 00:28:34.823
It's just a habit.

413
00:28:59.817 --> 00:29:01.027
Thank you.

414
00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.608
What for? I'm the one who's thankful.

415
00:29:05.608 --> 00:29:08.037
I can take baths easily now.

416
00:29:10.146 --> 00:29:12.596
Ah, I feel like a human being now.

417
00:29:22.173 --> 00:29:23.884
What?

418
00:29:23.884 --> 00:29:26.534
- Buy one, get one free?
- Yes.

419
00:29:26.534 --> 00:29:28.632
If I collect 10...

420
00:29:28.632 --> 00:29:31.712
will you send me
to the Grand Canyon with Bom?

421
00:29:40.305 --> 00:29:42.403
- Agreed.
- You agree?

422
00:29:43.794 --> 00:29:44.872
Yes!

423
00:29:47.712 --> 00:29:50.621
<i>Lee Shi Kyung, what is this?</i>

424
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:52.530
<i>You call this a report card?</i>

425
00:29:59.742 --> 00:30:01.750
<i>Hey! Get back here.</i>

426
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.792
You little punk. Hey!

427
00:30:03.792 --> 00:30:06.423
Hey, stop right there!

428
00:30:06.423 --> 00:30:08.742
Mom, I'm sorry!

429
00:30:08.742 --> 00:30:10.522
Just wait until you get back here!

430
00:30:13.765 --> 00:30:15.307
Seriously!

431
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.698
Why is it so complicated?

432
00:30:19.698 --> 00:30:22.648
It wasn't like this when
Shi Yoon was in school.

433
00:30:22.648 --> 00:30:25.079
Look here, Grandma.
This is the class ranking.

434
00:30:25.079 --> 00:30:27.262
Each class has different grades.

435
00:30:28.651 --> 00:30:31.648
19th... 19th in this one too.

436
00:30:31.648 --> 00:30:34.122
19th in all of them.

437
00:30:34.122 --> 00:30:36.932
Isn't 19th somewhere in the middle?

438
00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:42.328
Back when Shi Yoon was
in school, 19th was average.

439
00:30:42.328 --> 00:30:45.028
Classes had over 60 students back then.

440
00:30:45.028 --> 00:30:46.732
They're much smaller now.

441
00:30:46.732 --> 00:30:49.497
How many people are in Shi Kyung's class?

442
00:30:50.555 --> 00:30:52.597
20 people, Grandma. 20 people.

443
00:30:52.597 --> 00:30:53.692
What?

444
00:30:54.413 --> 00:30:58.702
Shi Kyung is 19th out of 20 people?

445
00:31:01.153 --> 00:31:03.653
Oh, that kid!

446
00:31:06.923 --> 00:31:10.653
When I was younger,
I used to ride this swing with my dad.

447
00:31:11.346 --> 00:31:13.400
- How about you?
- Me?

448
00:31:14.959 --> 00:31:16.788
I don't remember doing
anything with my dad.

449
00:31:17.761 --> 00:31:19.817
Weren't you close with your dad?

450
00:31:19.817 --> 00:31:20.919
I don't know.

451
00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:26.048
I don't even remember
if we were close or not.

452
00:31:26.048 --> 00:31:27.909
Is that even possible?

453
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:30.568
Should you get your head examined?

454
00:31:30.568 --> 00:31:31.711
I know, right?

455
00:31:32.748 --> 00:31:35.391
I wish I could remove
my brain and examine it.

456
00:31:35.391 --> 00:31:37.058
What is in my head?

457
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.269
Should I ask the stars?

458
00:31:45.263 --> 00:31:48.954
<i>Even Lee Shi Young can study,
so why can't I do it?</i>

459
00:31:48.954 --> 00:31:52.646
<i>So... what am I good at?</i>

460
00:31:58.563 --> 00:32:01.556
Moon Sung Joon! You little rascal.

461
00:32:01.556 --> 00:32:04.046
You ran out on your dad
and younger sibling.

462
00:32:04.046 --> 00:32:07.215
You cut off all contact with us
to live on your own

463
00:32:07.215 --> 00:32:09.839
only to end up lying here in this state?

464
00:32:09.839 --> 00:32:10.945
Father.

465
00:32:18.961 --> 00:32:22.195
Sung Joon... Sung Joon.

466
00:32:31.323 --> 00:32:32.948
<i>Sung Joon's father?</i>

467
00:32:32.948 --> 00:32:35.948
Sung Joon's getting worse,
so the hospice contacted his father.

468
00:32:35.948 --> 00:32:38.328
Is he becoming very sick?

469
00:32:38.328 --> 00:32:40.650
He's holding on
because of the painkillers.

470
00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:42.306
He's finally getting to see his dad

471
00:32:42.306 --> 00:32:44.558
but he's probably in too much
pain to even talk to him.

472
00:32:44.558 --> 00:32:46.861
- That's too bad.
- I know.

473
00:32:46.861 --> 00:32:49.704
If he had come when Sung Joon
was heroic and feeling stronger

474
00:32:49.704 --> 00:32:52.268
his father would have been
touched and very happy.

475
00:32:55.576 --> 00:32:59.946
I wish I could be happy and
touched by something you do.

476
00:33:00.929 --> 00:33:02.452
Bong Gu, hold on.

477
00:33:02.452 --> 00:33:04.817
Bong Gu, yeah right.

478
00:33:08.457 --> 00:33:12.163
Bom, I have to talk to Shi Kyung.
You can talk to him later.

479
00:33:16.574 --> 00:33:19.214
Mom, how did you know Bong Gu was Bom?

480
00:33:20.083 --> 00:33:22.188
That code word is just on your level.

481
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.012
<i>When Mom sits down in front of me,
it means there's a long battle ahead.</i>

482
00:33:28.012 --> 00:33:31.378
Lee Shi Kyung, you get involved in
other people's problems all the time.

483
00:33:31.378 --> 00:33:33.058
Why can't you take care of yourself?

484
00:33:33.058 --> 00:33:38.185
Even I'm studying late at night
to get my nursing certification.

485
00:33:38.185 --> 00:33:39.940
What's wrong with you?

486
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.998
Aren't you concerned about your future?

487
00:33:41.998 --> 00:33:45.028
<i>Dad, are you out there?</i>

488
00:33:45.028 --> 00:33:47.338
- <i>Save me if you are.</i>
- Answer me.

489
00:33:48.978 --> 00:33:50.284
<i>Eom Yong Gi.</i>

490
00:33:50.284 --> 00:33:52.900
<i>Go to the counseling office after class.</i>

491
00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:08.643
Why...

492
00:34:08.643 --> 00:34:10.712
Are you disappointed that it's me?

493
00:34:10.712 --> 00:34:13.853
No, I thought it was my homeroom
teacher who called me in here.

494
00:34:13.853 --> 00:34:17.422
I asked your homeroom teacher
to call you in here for me.

495
00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:21.083
Why? Are you going to say
something weird to me like before?

496
00:34:21.083 --> 00:34:22.849
That was my first time.

497
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:25.143
I was scared and new to things,
so I made a mistake.

498
00:34:25.143 --> 00:34:26.822
What about now?

499
00:34:26.822 --> 00:34:28.873
You're used to things and not scared.

500
00:34:28.873 --> 00:34:31.043
- Right.
- How are you now?

501
00:34:32.143 --> 00:34:33.844
You are so lovely.

502
00:34:38.586 --> 00:34:40.983
- What is this?
- It's a prize.

503
00:34:40.983 --> 00:34:44.963
You are so lovely when you sing,
so I'm giving you this prize.

504
00:34:50.684 --> 00:34:51.914
We're heading out now.

505
00:34:53.335 --> 00:34:56.139
I think I know who our
school's second couple will be.

506
00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:57.222
Who?

507
00:34:57.222 --> 00:34:59.708
- Ga Ram and Shi Young.
- What?

508
00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:02.135
I've been suspicious of them for a while.

509
00:35:02.135 --> 00:35:04.556
You haven't noticed?
You're Shi Young's brother.

510
00:35:04.556 --> 00:35:07.586
Of course not. They're not
in that kind of relationship.

511
00:35:07.586 --> 00:35:09.481
If it's not that, what is it?

512
00:35:09.481 --> 00:35:11.925
A relationship like the one
I have with Shi Young.

513
00:35:11.925 --> 00:35:15.719
No, it's more like an owner and his dog.

514
00:35:15.719 --> 00:35:17.735
- What are you saying?
- Hey.

515
00:35:17.735 --> 00:35:20.074
How can Lee Shi Young
look like a girl to you?

516
00:35:20.074 --> 00:35:23.614
She's like a puppy to Ga Ram.

517
00:35:23.614 --> 00:35:25.744
A puppy you just want to take care of.

518
00:35:25.744 --> 00:35:28.182
What? I think Shi Young is cute.

519
00:35:28.182 --> 00:35:29.601
She's very sassy and cute.

520
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:31.876
Sassy and cute? Shi Young?

521
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.827
Oh, oh, oh!

522
00:35:39.201 --> 00:35:40.445
Are you okay, Shi Young?

523
00:35:43.775 --> 00:35:48.514
I told you to hold on, so I
wouldn't fall. Why didn't you hold on?

524
00:35:48.514 --> 00:35:50.639
I thought you would be able to ride it.

525
00:35:50.639 --> 00:35:54.565
This is how people learn how to ride
a bike. It's how my dad taught me.

526
00:35:54.565 --> 00:35:56.079
Are you my dad?

527
00:35:57.655 --> 00:36:00.833
My dad wouldn't have done what you did.

528
00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:03.139
He would have made sure
that I wouldn't fall.

529
00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:04.693
I doubt that.

530
00:36:04.693 --> 00:36:07.208
Your dad would have done what I did.

531
00:36:07.208 --> 00:36:10.938
There's no other way to teach
a child how to ride a bike.

532
00:36:10.938 --> 00:36:15.228
Now that I think about it, I resented
my dad a lot whenever I would fall.

533
00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:20.878
I guess we have to resent our dads
when learning how to ride a bike.

534
00:36:27.773 --> 00:36:28.833
Hello.

535
00:36:32.864 --> 00:36:36.943
This is where my Sung Joon studied?

536
00:36:36.943 --> 00:36:40.844
Yes, I heard he studied here
until he became sick.

537
00:36:52.215 --> 00:36:53.362
In that state...

538
00:36:54.663 --> 00:36:56.822
he came here and studied?

539
00:36:56.822 --> 00:37:01.103
Many kids in our class probably received
help from Sung Joon during exams.

540
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:03.570
Not me, of course.

541
00:37:04.311 --> 00:37:05.335
Oh yeah.

542
00:37:05.335 --> 00:37:08.925
Did you know Sung Joon donated
a bathing machine to this hospice?

543
00:37:10.722 --> 00:37:12.675
My Sung Joon?

544
00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:21.856
<i>[Effort will not betray you!]</i>

545
00:37:21.856 --> 00:37:24.010
<i>[Passing the civil servant exam
is the path to life!]</i>

546
00:37:30.865 --> 00:37:33.547
You lived so hard on your own.

547
00:37:34.126 --> 00:37:36.545
Look at you now, huh?

548
00:37:37.295 --> 00:37:39.306
Where did all that spirit go?

549
00:37:39.306 --> 00:37:42.086
You just sleep there so weakly.

550
00:37:45.175 --> 00:37:47.438
Excuse me, Nurse.

551
00:37:47.438 --> 00:37:51.056
Has something happened to my Sung Joon?

552
00:37:51.056 --> 00:37:54.768
He sleeps all day long.
It seems very strange.

553
00:37:54.768 --> 00:37:56.657
It's because of the medication.

554
00:37:56.657 --> 00:37:59.659
He's in severe pain, so he has been
prescribed painkillers.

555
00:37:59.659 --> 00:38:02.398
Don't forget to give them to him
three times a day.

556
00:38:23.384 --> 00:38:26.125
<i>What? Donate your eyes?</i>

557
00:38:26.125 --> 00:38:28.128
You've been passed out this entire time.

558
00:38:28.128 --> 00:38:30.427
Now that you're finally awake

559
00:38:30.427 --> 00:38:32.679
you're telling me you want
to donate your eyes?

560
00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:37.407
I would like to donate my other organs.

561
00:38:37.407 --> 00:38:40.532
The only organs a cancer patient
can donate are the eyes.

562
00:38:40.532 --> 00:38:45.202
How will your spirit find its way
to your sacrificial rites without eyes?

563
00:38:45.202 --> 00:38:48.371
Don't do those when I die.

564
00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:49.791
What?

565
00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:51.652
I don't want you
to go through a hard time.

566
00:38:51.652 --> 00:38:55.179
If you care about your father,
why would you plan your death?

567
00:38:55.179 --> 00:38:57.934
Is this something you say to your father?

568
00:38:57.934 --> 00:39:01.673
Don't ever talk about organ donation
in front of me again.

569
00:39:03.682 --> 00:39:07.387
Have you already discussed it
with the hospice?

570
00:39:07.387 --> 00:39:09.646
- I haven't.
- Are you sure?

571
00:39:09.646 --> 00:39:11.282
This won't do.

572
00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:13.262
I have to go and check for myself.

573
00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:25.773
Shi Kyung...

574
00:39:31.315 --> 00:39:32.572
Please cancel it!

575
00:39:35.014 --> 00:39:36.385
What are you referring to?

576
00:39:36.385 --> 00:39:41.393
If my son said he wants to donate
his eyes, please disregard that.

577
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:45.007
Did Moon Sung Joon agree
to donate his eyes?

578
00:39:45.007 --> 00:39:47.061
No, this is the first
I've heard about it.

579
00:39:47.061 --> 00:39:50.369
He did ask me which organs
he could possibly donate.

580
00:39:50.369 --> 00:39:51.588
I told him.

581
00:39:54.186 --> 00:39:58.003
I can see that nothing
has been confirmed.

582
00:39:58.003 --> 00:40:02.590
Yes, it seems your son intends to donate.

583
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.940
He hasn't submitted any paperwork.

584
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.780
With organ donation,
the patient's intent is important.

585
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.230
But, the guardian's consent
is needed as well.

586
00:40:13.092 --> 00:40:16.326
Then, I don't need to worry.

587
00:40:18.952 --> 00:40:21.771
But, I'll say it once more just in case.

588
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.144
Sung Joon will not be donating his eyes!

589
00:40:35.192 --> 00:40:37.373
Sung Joon, hold on a little longer.

590
00:40:37.373 --> 00:40:38.922
I'll call the doctor for you.

591
00:40:41.813 --> 00:40:45.663
I called you over because
I have a favor to ask you.

592
00:40:45.663 --> 00:40:46.833
A favor?

593
00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.501
Can you hold on to this for me?

594
00:41:06.554 --> 00:41:07.884
It's weird.

595
00:41:08.978 --> 00:41:10.036
What is?

596
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:16.152
The first person I met at this hospice...

597
00:41:16.152 --> 00:41:19.628
was a soldier who asked me
to deliver a letter for him.

598
00:41:19.628 --> 00:41:22.898
Next, it was Grandma Oh Bong Sook
and now Sung Joon.

599
00:41:24.318 --> 00:41:27.240
Why do people always want
to give me something when they see me?

600
00:41:28.579 --> 00:41:30.927
It's one of your positive attributes.

601
00:41:30.927 --> 00:41:33.760
Positive attributes? What do you mean?

602
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.465
Listening and fulfilling
people's favor requests?

603
00:41:36.465 --> 00:41:37.623
Like a pushover?

604
00:41:37.623 --> 00:41:39.623
I suppose you could look at it that way.

605
00:41:41.057 --> 00:41:42.998
I really don't like that.

606
00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.315
My mom will find out if that trash knows.

607
00:41:51.847 --> 00:41:54.519
Hey, what is it that I can't know?

608
00:41:58.307 --> 00:42:00.378
- Move, this is my seat.
- Go somewhere else.

609
00:42:00.378 --> 00:42:02.597
I can't focus if I don't sit
where I always sit.

610
00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:14.889
That's a pretty scarf.

611
00:42:16.681 --> 00:42:18.670
Ga Ram gave it to me.

612
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:20.028
It doesn't look new.

613
00:42:20.028 --> 00:42:22.036
It belonged to Ga Ram's mom.

614
00:42:22.036 --> 00:42:25.612
No wonder it's so pretty.
I love worn-down clothes.

615
00:42:31.463 --> 00:42:33.864
Jung Soo, have you seen my scarf?

616
00:42:33.864 --> 00:42:35.342
What scarf?

617
00:42:36.014 --> 00:42:38.612
That red scarf I wear all the time.

618
00:42:38.612 --> 00:42:41.813
The one you bought from
that cart in front of our cafe?

619
00:42:41.813 --> 00:42:42.876
Yes.

620
00:42:43.967 --> 00:42:47.496
I was going to wear a bright color
for once, but I can't find it.

621
00:42:47.496 --> 00:42:49.983
You must have thrown it out
when we moved.

622
00:42:49.983 --> 00:42:51.094
You think so?

623
00:42:52.534 --> 00:42:54.974
It was quite worn out,
so it was time to it throw out.

624
00:42:56.271 --> 00:42:57.422
What is it?

625
00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:01.851
You said you like worn-down things.

626
00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:04.505
This is my mom's oldest,
most worn-down scarf.

627
00:43:08.599 --> 00:43:09.659
It is?

628
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:11.625
Look here.

629
00:43:12.911 --> 00:43:14.378
It's totally worn out.

630
00:43:19.951 --> 00:43:21.036
Do you like it?

631
00:43:22.588 --> 00:43:25.206
Yes, I like it.

632
00:43:25.206 --> 00:43:27.378
Then, I'll put it on you.

633
00:43:33.619 --> 00:43:36.079
How does it look? Does it suit me?

634
00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:37.847
Yes.

635
00:43:37.847 --> 00:43:39.885
Let's take a picture,
so we can remember this.

636
00:43:45.983 --> 00:43:47.422
<i>You're here?</i>

637
00:43:47.422 --> 00:43:48.893
Grandma!

638
00:43:48.893 --> 00:43:50.106
Hello.

639
00:43:50.106 --> 00:43:52.697
Why have you come empty-handed?

640
00:43:53.847 --> 00:43:56.315
Grandpa Won Ho is being
placed in his coffin today.

641
00:43:56.315 --> 00:43:58.182
You were supposed
to bring burial clothes.

642
00:44:03.108 --> 00:44:04.407
That's odd.

643
00:44:05.967 --> 00:44:08.748
I'm sure I had it
in my hands when I left.

644
00:44:08.748 --> 00:44:10.797
Did you leave it at home?

645
00:44:12.731 --> 00:44:15.949
You never forget anything.
This is so unlike you.

646
00:44:15.949 --> 00:44:17.865
When are you placing him in the coffin?

647
00:44:18.987 --> 00:44:20.875
In about an hour.

648
00:44:21.306 --> 00:44:23.061
I'll go home and come back quickly.

649
00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:25.798
Grandma, I'll go with you.

650
00:44:25.798 --> 00:44:26.869
Huh?

651
00:44:40.927 --> 00:44:43.157
Ghosts must be playing tricks on me.

652
00:44:43.157 --> 00:44:44.467
It's not in the room?

653
00:44:44.467 --> 00:44:46.407
No, it's not.

654
00:44:46.407 --> 00:44:48.889
I made it for Grandpa Won Ho.

655
00:44:48.889 --> 00:44:53.208
I remember wrapping it up nicely
and bringing it out with me.

656
00:44:56.963 --> 00:44:58.525
Oh, Grandma!

657
00:45:02.965 --> 00:45:04.744
Isn't this it?

658
00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:07.820
There it is! Oh...

659
00:45:08.914 --> 00:45:13.525
Oh, but why was it over here?

660
00:45:24.994 --> 00:45:27.925
You're in a lot pain, right? I know.

661
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:32.887
You have to endure it.

662
00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:38.307
Honestly, I had given up
when I first came here.

663
00:45:38.307 --> 00:45:42.086
But... I saw what you
posted on your wall.

664
00:45:42.086 --> 00:45:45.487
I saw those, and I changed my mind.

665
00:45:45.487 --> 00:45:48.733
With that mindset,
you can live, Moon Sung Joon.

666
00:45:49.838 --> 00:45:54.179
Do you really believe that I can live?

667
00:45:54.179 --> 00:45:55.398
Of course.

668
00:45:56.467 --> 00:45:58.652
You must have seen news here and there

669
00:45:58.652 --> 00:46:00.398
about terminal
cancer patients who survive.

670
00:46:00.923 --> 00:46:03.257
We'll fight until the end.

671
00:46:03.257 --> 00:46:07.257
I won't give up,
so don't you give up either.

672
00:46:08.213 --> 00:46:11.108
Why don't you eat some now
to help regain your strength?

673
00:46:12.007 --> 00:46:14.221
I've looked into this and that.

674
00:46:14.221 --> 00:46:16.981
Apparently, your fitness
is important when fighting cancer.

675
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:37.358
Mom.

676
00:46:39.804 --> 00:46:42.478
What kind of medicine is this?

677
00:46:42.478 --> 00:46:43.601
I don't know.

678
00:46:43.601 --> 00:46:44.693
Give it to me.

679
00:46:46.144 --> 00:46:47.414
They're painkillers.

680
00:46:47.864 --> 00:46:50.483
- Painkillers?
- Yes.

681
00:46:50.483 --> 00:46:54.202
They are painkillers in pill form,
instead of an injection.

682
00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:55.556
Why do you ask?

683
00:46:56.585 --> 00:46:59.204
Why aren't you saying anything?
Where did you get these?

684
00:46:59.204 --> 00:47:02.777
I found these in Sung Joon's trash can.

685
00:47:02.777 --> 00:47:04.849
What? His trash can?

686
00:47:12.512 --> 00:47:15.489
<i>[Various Types of Cancer
and Treatments for Them]</i>

687
00:47:23.094 --> 00:47:26.054
Excuse me. Are you Sung Joon's father?

688
00:47:26.054 --> 00:47:28.268
Yes, I am.

689
00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:33.282
My son found these
while emptying the trash can.

690
00:47:40.175 --> 00:47:43.255
I assume you accidentally
threw these away.

691
00:47:43.255 --> 00:47:46.905
Since you can't use these,
you'll have to get some more.

692
00:47:46.905 --> 00:47:49.755
Thank you for being
so kind and telling me.

693
00:47:49.755 --> 00:47:52.306
- It was not an accident.
- Excuse me?

694
00:47:53.492 --> 00:47:55.193
What do you mean it was not an accident?

695
00:47:55.193 --> 00:47:56.606
I threw them out on purpose.

696
00:47:59.648 --> 00:48:02.846
Did you know what you
were throwing out?

697
00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:07.056
The nurse said they are painkillers.

698
00:48:07.056 --> 00:48:09.003
You knew it so how...

699
00:48:09.003 --> 00:48:13.036
Without this medicine,
Sung Joon will have a hard time.

700
00:48:13.036 --> 00:48:14.996
Who are you, Lady?

701
00:48:15.867 --> 00:48:16.983
Me?

702
00:48:18.255 --> 00:48:19.940
That's not what's important.

703
00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.396
Thank you for your concern.

704
00:48:22.396 --> 00:48:24.251
But, I'm going to take care of my son.

705
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:27.217
Yes, but why did you
throw out these painkillers?

706
00:48:27.217 --> 00:48:29.364
Painkillers are addictive drugs.

707
00:48:29.364 --> 00:48:32.257
I can't have my son
turn into a drug addict.

708
00:48:39.976 --> 00:48:43.548
Sung Joon looks like
he's suffering so much.

709
00:48:43.548 --> 00:48:45.405
I guess you can't see that.

710
00:48:45.405 --> 00:48:47.335
Who says I can't see that!

711
00:48:47.335 --> 00:48:50.086
Do you think I don't know
that my son is sick?

712
00:48:50.086 --> 00:48:52.438
I'm doing this to heal my son!

713
00:49:02.871 --> 00:49:04.467
I'll try and convince him.

714
00:49:04.467 --> 00:49:05.918
Just maintain some restraint.

715
00:49:05.918 --> 00:49:09.766
Sung Joon's father needs to know
how bad the pain is

716
00:49:09.766 --> 00:49:11.190
for terminal cancer patients.

717
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:13.351
It seemed as though he was aware.

718
00:49:13.351 --> 00:49:15.936
How could he not know
when he's with Sung Joon?

719
00:49:15.936 --> 00:49:18.496
I don't know why he came here
if he was going to act this way.

720
00:49:18.496 --> 00:49:24.036
Don't terminal cancer patients
come to a hospice for pain relief?

721
00:49:24.036 --> 00:49:28.079
We are trying to keep him as
comfortable as possible until he dies.

722
00:49:28.079 --> 00:49:29.682
Why is he rejecting our treatment?

723
00:49:29.682 --> 00:49:32.507
Chief Nurse, you're getting angry again.

724
00:49:32.507 --> 00:49:35.286
You're thinking about
Jin Young's father, aren't you?

725
00:49:35.286 --> 00:49:37.235
Jin Young's father?

726
00:49:37.235 --> 00:49:38.762
Yes.

727
00:49:38.762 --> 00:49:41.871
He passed away earlier this year.

728
00:49:41.871 --> 00:49:46.005
Like Sung Joon, his father also said
he would become addicted to painkillers.

729
00:49:46.005 --> 00:49:48.193
He refused to let him take them.

730
00:49:48.193 --> 00:49:49.630
So, what happened?

731
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.677
Jin Young suffered in pain until the end.

732
00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:55.610
Jin Young's father regretted
his decision in the end.

733
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.920
Oh, how terrible.

734
00:50:00.259 --> 00:50:01.760
Oh, then...

735
00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.860
what if we tell Sung Joon's father
about Jin Young?

736
00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.469
It would be useless.

737
00:50:07.469 --> 00:50:10.030
This isn't about the painkillers.

738
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:13.672
It's about whether or not he can
accept his son's imminent death.

739
00:50:13.672 --> 00:50:18.197
Sung Joon's father can't accept
his son's death right now.

740
00:50:24.402 --> 00:50:27.635
You want to secretly sneak in
painkillers to Sung Joon?

741
00:50:27.635 --> 00:50:30.539
Yes, I thought about it.

742
00:50:30.539 --> 00:50:33.510
I think that's the only way
to help Sung Joon.

743
00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.300
Okay, when are you going to do it?

744
00:50:56.938 --> 00:50:58.059
He must be sleeping.

745
00:50:59.726 --> 00:51:01.059
I'll check and see.

746
00:51:07.782 --> 00:51:08.806
Is he asleep?

747
00:51:08.806 --> 00:51:10.030
I can't tell.

748
00:51:15.659 --> 00:51:18.291
What if his dad suddenly comes out
while we're in here?

749
00:51:19.052 --> 00:51:21.059
- Strange...
- Why?

750
00:51:22.103 --> 00:51:24.123
- I don't hear anything.
- Huh?

751
00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:43.344
<i>He was discharged?</i>

752
00:51:43.344 --> 00:51:44.344
Yes.

753
00:51:44.344 --> 00:51:46.438
They did the paperwork
yesterday and left.

754
00:51:47.217 --> 00:51:48.639
That shouldn't have happened.

755
00:51:48.639 --> 00:51:50.304
We had this made for him, too.

756
00:51:51.568 --> 00:51:53.512
<i>[Civil Servant ID]</i>

757
00:51:54.858 --> 00:51:58.309
We were going to give him
this gift before he left.

758
00:51:58.309 --> 00:52:00.179
Where did Sung Joon go?

759
00:52:00.179 --> 00:52:02.358
To a temple near the hospice.

760
00:52:02.358 --> 00:52:03.429
A temple?

761
00:52:07.548 --> 00:52:09.150
<i>Oh! Four ones?</i>

762
00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:11.492
<i>It's four signals from Sung Joon.</i>

763
00:52:11.492 --> 00:52:14.001
<i>I have to go to Sung Joon.
I have no time.</i>

764
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:17.411
- Where are you going, Shi Kyung?
- To Sung Joon!

765
00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:23.010
<i>It's the vice-principal.
I can't get caught.</i>

766
00:52:25.652 --> 00:52:27.451
Lee Shi Kyung!

767
00:52:27.451 --> 00:52:31.208
You must not want to go to the
Grand Canyon with Bom anymore.

768
00:52:31.208 --> 00:52:33.460
No, I still plan to go.

769
00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:36.099
- How?
- I'm going to add a cactus.

770
00:52:36.099 --> 00:52:37.920
Really?

771
00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.063
What kind of cactus will it be this time?

772
00:52:41.413 --> 00:52:43.782
I'll tell you next time. I'm a bit busy.

773
00:52:46.083 --> 00:52:48.994
<i>Oh! He's an even bigger obstacle.</i>
