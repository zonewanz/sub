1
00:00:18.503 --> 00:00:19.503
Hey, what is this?

2
00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:20.503
(Episode 12)

3
00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:22.672
It looks like a talisman of some sort.

4
00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:24.203
Inspector Choi.

5
00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:27.543
What do you think this is?

6
00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:30.543
I'm not sure. I should test it first.

7
00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:32.082
Can't you tell right away?

8
00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:34.283
I'm not a ghost.

9
00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:38.482
How does Moo Gang know it then?

10
00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:42.652
Hey. What do you mean by the thing you said earlier?

11
00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:45.122
It's the same way the director of the mental hospital was murdered?

12
00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:48.332
Are you saying the person who killed the director killed this woman too?

13
00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:50.402
Open it.

14
00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:55.472
The way she was murdered is the same as the director.

15
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.802
It's the same weapon, the same depth, and the same twist.

16
00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:04.083
What is it then?

17
00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:06.683
Are you saying she was murdered because of a grudge?

18
00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:10.183
There is a difference between the two deaths.

19
00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:12.723
Yes.

20
00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:15.752
There was no mentioning of a tape.

21
00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:18.023
What kind of tape is it that...

22
00:01:23.232 --> 00:01:24.532
It's him, isn't it?

23
00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.532
You and he schemed to lock me up in here, right?

24
00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:33.573
He stabbed the director several times while avoiding vital spots.

25
00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:37.282
You and that punk locked me up in here...

26
00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:41.782
for 20 years.

27
00:01:43.183 --> 00:01:45.782
He enjoyed watching her be in pain...

28
00:01:46.152 --> 00:01:48.392
and stabbed a vital spot at the end.

29
00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:50.963
He enjoyed watching her die slowly.

30
00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:02.402
What is it?

31
00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:05.303
What?

32
00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:08.843
What is this?

33
00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:11.313
Who are you?

34
00:02:11.543 --> 00:02:13.082
What is this? What's going on?

35
00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:17.153
On the other hand, he stabbed Lee Mi So's vital spot at once.

36
00:02:17.623 --> 00:02:19.952
With the director, he stabbed a vital spot at the end.

37
00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:23.892
But he stabbed Lee Mi So's vital spot first and killed her.

38
00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:26.593
He stabbed her in different places after that.

39
00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:31.403
She probably wasn't in pain.

40
00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:35.973
So it's the same guy,

41
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.672
but he doesn't hold a grudge against Lee Mi So?

42
00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:41.913
He's right. Here.

43
00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:43.612
He stabbed her neck first.

44
00:02:43.612 --> 00:02:44.783
This is the cause of her death.

45
00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:46.753
Is that so?

46
00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:54.193
Ms. Lee Mi So was found dead in her car.

47
00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:57.223
According to the witness, the suspect had bandages on his hand...

48
00:02:57.223 --> 00:02:59.093
and a scar on his face.

49
00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:00.163
A scar?

50
00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:03.962
No way. A lot of people have scars on their faces.

51
00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:07.732
Don't try to change people's fate carelessly.

52
00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:09.202
Remember what I said.

53
00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:13.202
You won't be able to bear the consequence.

54
00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:14.742
No way. It wouldn't be him.

55
00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:21.813
It wouldn't be him.

56
00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:25.582
He has no reason to kill an actress.

57
00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:31.392
Welcome.

58
00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:35.533
I'm looking for a person who had a meal here and signed like this.

59
00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:36.832
Do you remember this?

60
00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:41.133
We get many customers. I don't remember everyone's signature.

61
00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:42.633
It's also two months ago.

62
00:03:44.403 --> 00:03:47.772
May I see the security camera footage on this date?

63
00:03:47.772 --> 00:03:49.843
I really have to find this person.

64
00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:51.742
We don't have security cameras here.

65
00:04:22.713 --> 00:04:25.742
Moo Gang. Did you go to Chuncheon?

66
00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:27.682
What?

67
00:04:28.552 --> 00:04:30.223
Yes, for an investigation.

68
00:04:31.622 --> 00:04:33.853
This isn't your signature. Whose is it?

69
00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:36.723
It's someone who helps me with work...

70
00:04:36.963 --> 00:04:40.093
like an operative. We had a meal, and that person signed it.

71
00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:43.663
What's the case?

72
00:04:45.163 --> 00:04:46.502
Actually,

73
00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:50.172
it's the hit-and-run accident of my brother.

74
00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:52.172
I'm investigating it.

75
00:04:57.083 --> 00:04:58.482
I'm sure this person...

76
00:04:59.242 --> 00:05:01.252
knows where the tape is.

77
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:03.552
I have to find it before they do.

78
00:05:05.023 --> 00:05:06.953
That's the only way I can protect Moo Gang.

79
00:05:10.793 --> 00:05:14.192
Gosh, let him go already. I have to take him outside.

80
00:05:15.293 --> 00:05:18.862
Even if he stays here, the loser won't come in here.

81
00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:24.103
All right. This is our case now.

82
00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:26.403
We got a new identikit of the suspect of the asylum murder case.

83
00:05:26.403 --> 00:05:27.872
- Here. Take a look. - What?

84
00:05:29.242 --> 00:05:30.312
Darn it.

85
00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:32.742
What is this? Gosh.

86
00:05:32.913 --> 00:05:35.612
Why does he suddenly have a scar on his face?

87
00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:39.783
You're pulling all kinds of tricks to steal our cases now.

88
00:05:39.783 --> 00:05:42.752
It was on the news that the one who killed Lee Mi So had a scar.

89
00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:44.963
The hospital staff changed her statement.

90
00:05:44.963 --> 00:05:48.192
That's absolute nonsense.

91
00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:51.232
When we went to back you up, no one said anything about a scar.

92
00:05:51.232 --> 00:05:52.333
Don't try to fool us.

93
00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:53.672
Someone did tell me.

94
00:05:55.773 --> 00:05:56.942
Someone told me...

95
00:05:56.942 --> 00:05:59.072
that the suspect had a scar on his face.

96
00:05:59.502 --> 00:06:01.942
I forgot to say this earlier because of the mess,

97
00:06:02.413 --> 00:06:03.843
but that patient...

98
00:06:04.112 --> 00:06:06.312
had a scar on his face shaped like a hook.

99
00:06:09.853 --> 00:06:12.023
Why are you telling us that now?

100
00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:13.223
Didn't I tell you before?

101
00:06:13.223 --> 00:06:14.653
No, you didn't.

102
00:06:14.653 --> 00:06:17.062
That's why I said it's the same guy who killed the hospital director.

103
00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:22.732
What on earth have you been investigating all this time?

104
00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:26.703
It happened a long time ago, and the identikit isn't even right.

105
00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:28.903
Do you think this is a common scar?

106
00:06:31.043 --> 00:06:34.043
If you had found it out sooner, we could've stopped additional murder.

107
00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:35.973
Don't you try to lay the blame on us.

108
00:06:35.973 --> 00:06:38.182
The nurse told Moo Gang about the scar.

109
00:06:38.283 --> 00:06:40.982
It all happened because that lunatic didn't tell anyone about it.

110
00:06:40.982 --> 00:06:42.783
"Lunatic"? How dare you...

111
00:06:42.783 --> 00:06:44.953
- call him that? - Gosh, stop.

112
00:06:44.953 --> 00:06:46.453
- Let go of me! - Captain Bong!

113
00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:47.992
- How dare you! - Please stop.

114
00:06:47.992 --> 00:06:50.492
- I'm going to kill you! - Stop, Captain Bong.

115
00:06:50.492 --> 00:06:51.922
I saw him.

116
00:06:52.093 --> 00:06:53.192
You jerks!

117
00:06:53.192 --> 00:06:56.232
I saw him. Hey! I said I saw him!

118
00:07:04.643 --> 00:07:06.973
Yes. I remember this scar.

119
00:07:06.973 --> 00:07:08.773
It was my first day working with him.

120
00:07:09.242 --> 00:07:11.513
He came to my office and asked for work.

121
00:07:11.513 --> 00:07:14.453
He was short, but his figure, eyes, and nose seemed strong.

122
00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:16.723
I thought he'd do a good job.

123
00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:20.453
Did he know that you were going to Moojin?

124
00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:22.593
Yes. He knew it when he came.

125
00:07:22.593 --> 00:07:24.523
He even checked it with me several times.

126
00:07:25.263 --> 00:07:26.793
- Is that so? - Yes.

127
00:07:26.793 --> 00:07:28.393
(Interrogation Room)

128
00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:36.232
Hi. Please don't worry. Our team is on the case now.

129
00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:40.713
Also, I think the one who chained the container is him. Yes.

130
00:07:41.112 --> 00:07:42.672
I checked it myself.

131
00:07:43.812 --> 00:07:45.013
Okay.

132
00:07:45.013 --> 00:07:46.112
Excuse me.

133
00:07:47.713 --> 00:07:50.283
What did he say? Does he know where the suspect is?

134
00:07:50.523 --> 00:07:54.252
What kind of a murderer lets people know where he is?

135
00:07:54.752 --> 00:07:56.052
He must've run away already.

136
00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:07.533
I shouldn't have saved his life. Why am I so meddlesome?

137
00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:10.072
If you want to pull your hair out, you should pull harder.

138
00:08:12.103 --> 00:08:15.143
Leo... What is Leo doing here?

139
00:08:16.372 --> 00:08:18.513
He will be filming a drama about detectives or something.

140
00:08:18.513 --> 00:08:20.453
He's following me around to study his character.

141
00:08:21.312 --> 00:08:23.882
I guess I'm the best detective there is.

142
00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:27.393
It's the drama that the writer who tried to die at the rooftop wrote.

143
00:08:27.692 --> 00:08:29.453
Oh, is it the one she wrote?

144
00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:31.463
I just thought it's unfair that...

145
00:08:31.463 --> 00:08:34.663
the filthy idiots in this field are trampling on a weak person together.

146
00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:36.663
I have some power, so I backed her up a little.

147
00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:37.903
That's good news.

148
00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:42.432
Wait.

149
00:08:47.613 --> 00:08:48.812
It's him.

150
00:08:49.972 --> 00:08:51.483
The person I saw at the broadcasting station.

151
00:08:52.913 --> 00:08:54.352
That scar on his face.

152
00:08:54.883 --> 00:08:56.082
When that writer was trying...

153
00:08:56.582 --> 00:08:58.582
to throw herself off the rooftop of the broadcasting station,

154
00:08:58.783 --> 00:09:00.222
he almost died by having her fall on him.

155
00:09:02.293 --> 00:09:04.322
You shouldn't be here. You'll die if you stay here.

156
00:09:04.322 --> 00:09:05.763
Move to that side now.

157
00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:06.793
That's right.

158
00:09:07.692 --> 00:09:10.602
The security camera there might have caught him.

159
00:09:10.663 --> 00:09:12.363
- Let's go now. - That's enough.

160
00:09:13.472 --> 00:09:14.873
Do you think you're a detective?

161
00:09:14.873 --> 00:09:17.403
He's already on the wanted list, and the police started investigating.

162
00:09:17.602 --> 00:09:19.903
You should just wait without doing anything.

163
00:09:21.273 --> 00:09:22.442
But...

164
00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.543
Look at yourself.

165
00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:27.852
You're injured everywhere by trying to save people's lives.

166
00:09:27.852 --> 00:09:29.883
You will get yourself killed if you keep doing this.

167
00:09:29.883 --> 00:09:31.523
He's a brutal serial killer.

168
00:09:31.523 --> 00:09:33.322
How can someone like you catch someone like that?

169
00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:36.293
What then? Do you want me to just sit back and watch?

170
00:09:36.422 --> 00:09:39.863
It'd still be distressing to just wait without doing anything.

171
00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:42.562
If I hadn't saved his life twice,

172
00:09:42.562 --> 00:09:44.062
Lee Mi So wouldn't have died.

173
00:09:44.302 --> 00:09:47.873
He may be killing another person somewhere even at this moment.

174
00:09:47.873 --> 00:09:49.332
Let's go. Please.

175
00:09:57.283 --> 00:09:59.243
Fine. Let's go.

176
00:09:59.883 --> 00:10:01.682
Let's go. Lead the way. Go.

177
00:10:05.483 --> 00:10:06.623
What does that mean?

178
00:10:07.393 --> 00:10:08.623
She saved his life twice?

179
00:10:13.462 --> 00:10:14.663
What should we do?

180
00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:16.562
It's not showing his face.

181
00:10:16.562 --> 00:10:17.832
I'm sure it's him.

182
00:10:17.832 --> 00:10:19.962
Was that dead girl also at the broadcasting station on that day?

183
00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:21.633
Yes, she was.

184
00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:24.643
She was the host of the music show Leo performed in that day.

185
00:10:24.643 --> 00:10:27.842
So he didn't pick an imported car because he needed money.

186
00:10:28.513 --> 00:10:29.743
Look at here.

187
00:10:29.743 --> 00:10:32.013
He's hanging around. It looks like he was waiting for someone.

188
00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:34.712
Oh, it sort of looks like that now that I'm looking at it again.

189
00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:37.283
Then let's check if Lee Mi So...

190
00:10:37.283 --> 00:10:40.222
came to the broadcasting station on any other days.

191
00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:41.592
I'll look into that.

192
00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:44.393
I'm close with her manager.

193
00:10:45.523 --> 00:10:46.962
Thanks so much, Leo.

194
00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:54.672
I deserve that too.

195
00:10:55.702 --> 00:10:57.373
I found out everything too.

196
00:11:07.153 --> 00:11:09.013
Gosh, what on earth happened?

197
00:11:09.983 --> 00:11:12.582
There's nothing notable. Why did they wipe all the data from 1997?

198
00:11:14.793 --> 00:11:18.192
Goodness, Oh Man Ho sure covered his tracks very well.

199
00:11:27.903 --> 00:11:29.432
30 million dollars?

200
00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:34.572
That is a lot of money. Where did they send 30 million dollars?

201
00:11:36.883 --> 00:11:38.082
What is this bank account?

202
00:11:41.783 --> 00:11:44.052
Hold on a second. Look. He's back.

203
00:11:44.052 --> 00:11:45.182
It seems certain now.

204
00:11:45.352 --> 00:11:48.552
Like you said, Lee Mi So didn't get killed randomly.

205
00:11:48.692 --> 00:11:50.462
It must've been premeditated.

206
00:11:51.322 --> 00:11:52.623
What should we do though?

207
00:11:52.623 --> 00:11:54.932
Even here, his face wasn't caught on camera.

208
00:11:57.533 --> 00:11:59.763
He must know the exact locations of all the CCTV cameras.

209
00:11:59.763 --> 00:12:01.903
He purposely avoided his face getting caught on any of them.

210
00:12:02.733 --> 00:12:06.172
Wouldn't his face have been caught on the car's dashboard camera?

211
00:12:06.172 --> 00:12:07.543
Who's in that car?

212
00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:09.672
I think whoever was in that car probably saw him.

213
00:12:09.913 --> 00:12:11.113
Was it Lee Mi So's manager?

214
00:12:11.113 --> 00:12:14.352
But her manager wouldn't get her behind the building so secretly.

215
00:12:15.952 --> 00:12:18.222
Oh, could it be her backer?

216
00:12:18.983 --> 00:12:20.552
When I ran into her at the club,

217
00:12:20.552 --> 00:12:23.422
she told me that she loves someone now.

218
00:12:23.922 --> 00:12:26.322
From my experience, I know that fans can turn into stalkers...

219
00:12:26.322 --> 00:12:28.263
when something like that gets disclosed.

220
00:12:28.263 --> 00:12:29.592
I think it was a stalker's doing.

221
00:12:29.592 --> 00:12:31.802
What? Han Moo Gang?

222
00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:33.572
What are you doing here?

223
00:12:35.633 --> 00:12:38.342
The person who killed Lee Mi So. We think it's him.

224
00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:40.172
- What? - Please have a look at this.

225
00:12:40.913 --> 00:12:43.413
His face must've been caught on this car's dashboard camera.

226
00:12:44.942 --> 00:12:48.113
It's possible that the driver of this car saw the killer's face.

227
00:12:48.113 --> 00:12:49.283
We must...

228
00:12:49.952 --> 00:12:51.523
identify that person first.

229
00:12:51.523 --> 00:12:54.153
Find footage that shows this car from a different angle.

230
00:12:54.153 --> 00:12:55.922
Let's see if the license plate was caught at least.

231
00:13:02.062 --> 00:13:04.163
How is it possible that nothing was caught?

232
00:13:04.702 --> 00:13:06.062
This is ridiculous.

233
00:13:06.062 --> 00:13:08.972
I'll look into it. Moo Gang and all of you should get out now.

234
00:13:10.273 --> 00:13:13.043
Don't go snooping around in our cases from now on!

235
00:13:14.572 --> 00:13:15.672
Let's go.

236
00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:19.812
Come on.

237
00:13:32.123 --> 00:13:33.293
Those rats...

238
00:13:33.293 --> 00:13:34.293
(Security Management Office)

239
00:13:37.403 --> 00:13:38.802
I should get going.

240
00:13:39.462 --> 00:13:41.572
I have a costume fitting booked for my new drama.

241
00:13:45.003 --> 00:13:47.613
I'm certain that the loser is somewhere around that jerk.

242
00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:50.812
I'll get to that after helping Ha Ram with her urgent matters.

243
00:13:51.712 --> 00:13:53.243
It wasn't your fault.

244
00:13:53.682 --> 00:13:56.052
I prevented his death twice,

245
00:13:56.922 --> 00:13:58.523
and someone died as a result.

246
00:13:58.523 --> 00:14:00.592
You didn't know that he was a murderer.

247
00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:03.663
So just leave it up to the police to catch him.

248
00:14:03.663 --> 00:14:05.893
But what if he kills another person?

249
00:14:07.293 --> 00:14:11.003
His face could've been caught on CCTV cameras in the vicinity,

250
00:14:11.003 --> 00:14:12.633
so I'll look into it more before I leave.

251
00:14:13.733 --> 00:14:14.903
Ha Ram...

252
00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:18.903
Gosh... That human. Seriously.

253
00:14:25.743 --> 00:14:27.513
I barely managed to shake off the guards.

254
00:14:28.812 --> 00:14:29.812
What?

255
00:14:30.322 --> 00:14:31.523
Dad.

256
00:14:33.592 --> 00:14:35.793
Dad, you can watch TV on your own now.

257
00:14:39.023 --> 00:14:41.233
Dad, I came to see you because I had a question to ask.

258
00:14:41.692 --> 00:14:44.832
This. I found this in one of the reports from 1997.

259
00:14:44.832 --> 00:14:46.102
Do you know what this is?

260
00:14:47.702 --> 00:14:49.602
(Send 30 million dollars, 110-312-250850)

261
00:14:53.243 --> 00:14:54.472
You know what it is, don't you?

262
00:14:54.472 --> 00:14:56.743
What's this about? What was the money for? And whose account is it?

263
00:14:56.743 --> 00:14:58.883
I went through all the documents,

264
00:14:58.883 --> 00:15:01.352
but there was nothing about this bank account.

265
00:15:01.352 --> 00:15:04.623
Also, it looks like someone wiped all the data from 1997.

266
00:15:04.952 --> 00:15:06.422
It sounds strange to you too, right?

267
00:15:07.592 --> 00:15:09.092
Dad, do you know anything about this?

268
00:15:11.722 --> 00:15:13.493
Don't do anything useless.

269
00:15:18.733 --> 00:15:19.903
It's Man Ho, isn't it?

270
00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:22.932
He must've done something bad with this money.

271
00:15:22.932 --> 00:15:25.503
You probably can't say anything because you want to protect him.

272
00:15:25.503 --> 00:15:26.743
Man Soo.

273
00:15:31.883 --> 00:15:33.413
I bet you don't like seeing this...

274
00:15:34.113 --> 00:15:35.483
going on between us brothers.

275
00:15:36.483 --> 00:15:39.283
I would've turned a blind eye to everything and acted...

276
00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:41.922
as if everything was fine if he hadn't done that to Sip Gyeon,

277
00:15:43.962 --> 00:15:45.293
but it's too late now.

278
00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:47.733
I cannot forgive him.

279
00:15:48.932 --> 00:15:51.663
Forget it if you don't want to tell me. I'll find out on my own.

280
00:15:52.302 --> 00:15:53.472
The key.

281
00:15:56.133 --> 00:15:57.202
Man Soo.

282
00:15:59.342 --> 00:16:00.773
There's a key...

283
00:16:02.812 --> 00:16:04.513
inside the safe in my room.

284
00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:07.712
Bring it to me immediately.

285
00:16:08.952 --> 00:16:10.153
What's the key for?

286
00:16:10.153 --> 00:16:11.623
I'll tell you when the right time comes.

287
00:16:14.123 --> 00:16:16.123
The password...

288
00:16:18.822 --> 00:16:21.592
It's... It's your date of birth.

289
00:16:25.663 --> 00:16:27.403
- Okay, Dad. - The police are openly searching...

290
00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:28.832
for a suspected serial killer.

291
00:16:28.832 --> 00:16:31.143
It's been revealed that the suspect in Actress Lee Mi So's murder...

292
00:16:31.143 --> 00:16:34.442
is the man who is suspected of killing...

293
00:16:34.442 --> 00:16:38.812
the director of the mental hospital in Yangju recently.

294
00:16:38.812 --> 00:16:40.653
The suspect has a scar on the right side of his face, and...

295
00:16:40.653 --> 00:16:43.212
- How far will you take this? - his height is presumed to be...

296
00:16:43.212 --> 00:16:45.452
How far are you going to go? You fool.

297
00:16:45.452 --> 00:16:48.293
If Man Soo is put in danger,

298
00:16:48.623 --> 00:16:50.793
I'll never forgive you.

299
00:17:08.773 --> 00:17:09.812
What's going on?

300
00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:11.983
How did you get in?

301
00:17:12.443 --> 00:17:14.253
Has this jerk ever come to see you?

302
00:17:16.412 --> 00:17:18.253
Who is that man?

303
00:17:20.652 --> 00:17:21.993
He's the one...

304
00:17:22.822 --> 00:17:24.322
who killed the madam 20 years ago.

305
00:17:25.562 --> 00:17:27.693
I got him locked up in a mental hospital,

306
00:17:28.463 --> 00:17:30.763
but he escaped and has been causing trouble ever since.

307
00:17:32.362 --> 00:17:34.003
If he does come to see you,

308
00:17:34.902 --> 00:17:37.443
do whatever you can to buy time, and call me right away.

309
00:18:02.162 --> 00:18:03.662
Because his modus operandi is cruel,

310
00:18:03.662 --> 00:18:06.973
and it's possible that he might commit additional crimes for money,

311
00:18:06.973 --> 00:18:08.332
the police have decided to openly search for...

312
00:18:08.332 --> 00:18:11.743
I just escaped from a mental hospital,

313
00:18:11.743 --> 00:18:14.043
so you'll have to help me.

314
00:18:14.812 --> 00:18:18.483
I was totally surprised. Who knew you'd become a doctor?

315
00:18:18.483 --> 00:18:20.183
And you're Han Moo Gang's girlfriend.

316
00:18:38.062 --> 00:18:39.203
Answer me.

317
00:18:40.003 --> 00:18:42.132
How on earth do you know Moo Gang?

318
00:18:43.602 --> 00:18:44.872
Han Moo Gang?

319
00:18:44.872 --> 00:18:48.842
That boyfriend of yours came to see me at the mental hospital...

320
00:18:48.842 --> 00:18:50.543
and asked me about his brother.

321
00:18:50.943 --> 00:18:53.183
Back then, I was in pretty bad shape,

322
00:18:53.953 --> 00:18:55.513
so he told me not to take my medication.

323
00:18:55.513 --> 00:18:57.483
He said he'd come back, but he never did.

324
00:18:57.652 --> 00:18:59.882
That's why I got out of the hospital on my own.

325
00:19:03.352 --> 00:19:04.763
You must keep your promise.

326
00:19:05.423 --> 00:19:08.433
Do not show up in front of me ever again, and stay away from Moo Gang.

327
00:19:09.763 --> 00:19:10.933
Don't you worry.

328
00:19:12.562 --> 00:19:16.033
He'll be fine as long as he doesn't interfere with what I'm doing.

329
00:19:18.473 --> 00:19:19.902
I won't forget that you helped me out this time.

330
00:19:24.183 --> 00:19:27.312
Just keep your eyes wide open, and watch...

331
00:19:27.312 --> 00:19:29.582
how I slowly kill that scumbag.

332
00:19:31.822 --> 00:19:34.023
Look forward to it, Kim Sun Young.

333
00:19:43.632 --> 00:19:44.802
No way.

334
00:19:47.602 --> 00:19:49.802
Moo Gang won't investigate the case, right?

335
00:20:07.223 --> 00:20:09.392
(Confirmation of Life Insurance Payment)

336
00:20:10.923 --> 00:20:12.793
Wang Young Choon...

337
00:20:13.592 --> 00:20:15.293
The man who killed Ha Ram's dad?

338
00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:17.802
Why is Dad keeping this in his safe?

339
00:20:34.013 --> 00:20:35.483
Thank goodness.

340
00:20:36.483 --> 00:20:39.923
I guess Moo Gang's team isn't handling his case.

341
00:20:41.092 --> 00:20:43.463
Who is on their side?

342
00:20:48.162 --> 00:20:51.562
Hey. Are you really not going to control that lunatic on your team?

343
00:20:51.902 --> 00:20:53.703
Why are you picking a fight again?

344
00:20:53.872 --> 00:20:56.973
He's snooping around everywhere to catch the one who killed Lee Mi So!

345
00:20:56.973 --> 00:20:58.842
Tell him to stay out of our case!

346
00:21:00.173 --> 00:21:01.473
Moo Gang is...

347
00:21:01.872 --> 00:21:03.743
investigating his case?

348
00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:09.713
- Hi, Ms. Fortune-teller. - You said you can trace anything.

349
00:21:09.713 --> 00:21:11.983
Could you find out what Lee Mi So has been up to?

350
00:21:11.983 --> 00:21:13.082
Lee Mi So?

351
00:21:14.453 --> 00:21:15.793
The one who got murdered?

352
00:21:16.352 --> 00:21:18.293
- Why? - A man I saved twice...

353
00:21:18.562 --> 00:21:20.493
- seems like the one who killed her. - What?

354
00:21:20.493 --> 00:21:23.632
I was wondering if he and she were related in any way.

355
00:21:23.662 --> 00:21:26.233
I'm looking into it with Detective Han, but we haven't found anything.

356
00:21:26.233 --> 00:21:28.733
- Could you help us? - Okay. I'll try.

357
00:21:29.802 --> 00:21:30.872
All right.

358
00:21:33.072 --> 00:21:34.372
Lee Mi So?

359
00:21:40.112 --> 00:21:41.283
Who is that?

360
00:21:42.213 --> 00:21:43.753
Can I help you with something?

361
00:21:44.483 --> 00:21:45.523
Who...

362
00:21:46.183 --> 00:21:47.223
What?

363
00:21:48.092 --> 00:21:50.892
Aren't you the prettiest doctor at Royeol Hospital?

364
00:21:51.463 --> 00:21:52.793
Who are you?

365
00:21:53.693 --> 00:21:54.993
Here, please drink this.

366
00:21:56.632 --> 00:22:00.173
Do you know where Moo Gang is?

367
00:22:00.473 --> 00:22:02.233
He's not answering his phone.

368
00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:05.572
He seemed busy chasing a killer with Ms. Fortune-teller.

369
00:22:06.673 --> 00:22:08.572
Miss... What?

370
00:22:08.842 --> 00:22:09.842
Sorry?

371
00:22:10.443 --> 00:22:13.552
Don't you know Ms. Fortune-teller?

372
00:22:14.953 --> 00:22:17.882
She's Detective Han's friend from his hometown,

373
00:22:17.882 --> 00:22:19.552
who often wears sunglasses.

374
00:22:20.552 --> 00:22:22.793
She's a great fortuneteller.

375
00:22:23.223 --> 00:22:26.463
She's such a talented fortuneteller that...

376
00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:28.832
she can see if someone will die soon.

377
00:22:29.592 --> 00:22:32.102
She's been saving people's lives,

378
00:22:33.233 --> 00:22:34.602
but one of the people she's saved...

379
00:22:35.402 --> 00:22:37.173
turned out to be the man...

380
00:22:37.543 --> 00:22:38.943
who killed Lee Mi So.

381
00:22:40.473 --> 00:22:41.473
What?

382
00:22:41.473 --> 00:22:44.443
She's someone who'd run wildly to catch him herself.

383
00:22:44.443 --> 00:22:47.213
That's probably why Detective Han is tagging along with her.

384
00:22:47.713 --> 00:22:49.612
She should just leave it to the police.

385
00:22:59.862 --> 00:23:03.033
By the way, why is that girl wearing sunglasses?

386
00:23:03.362 --> 00:23:05.033
Her eyes are special.

387
00:23:05.203 --> 00:23:07.132
- "Special"? - Yes.

388
00:23:07.132 --> 00:23:10.173
She can see death. She knows how someone will die.

389
00:23:10.173 --> 00:23:11.572
No way.

390
00:23:11.572 --> 00:23:15.013
It's true. I didn't believe it either, but it was true.

391
00:23:15.013 --> 00:23:16.112
What?

392
00:23:17.983 --> 00:23:19.082
Are you saying...

393
00:23:19.842 --> 00:23:21.713
Moo Gang is chasing after that killer...

394
00:23:22.082 --> 00:23:23.953
because of that woman?

395
00:23:24.183 --> 00:23:27.693
Yes. Detective Han does everything she asks for.

396
00:23:30.423 --> 00:23:33.463
Oh, please... Please don't misunderstand.

397
00:23:33.463 --> 00:23:36.162
He's with her because of work and nothing else.

398
00:23:36.392 --> 00:23:38.332
They're not in any romantic relationship.

399
00:23:38.602 --> 00:23:41.832
I'm sorry, but could you get me some more coffee?

400
00:23:43.102 --> 00:23:44.102
Sure.

401
00:23:57.552 --> 00:23:59.783
Wait. What about... What about the coffee?

402
00:24:02.392 --> 00:24:04.463
I can't believe not a single camera caught him.

403
00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:09.733
He's meticulous.

404
00:24:10.132 --> 00:24:12.662
He didn't even leave any traces at the mental hospital either.

405
00:24:14.102 --> 00:24:16.703
I'll call you after checking if they made any progress at the office.

406
00:24:17.902 --> 00:24:19.302
Thank you, Joon.

407
00:24:19.902 --> 00:24:21.013
Call me.

408
00:24:31.783 --> 00:24:33.923
I have to keep them apart...

409
00:24:35.092 --> 00:24:36.822
to make sure Moo Gang is safe.

410
00:24:46.632 --> 00:24:48.802
Maybe I shouldn't have saved anyone's life.

411
00:24:55.013 --> 00:24:56.743
What brings you to my house?

412
00:24:58.513 --> 00:25:01.213
I thought I should tell you this.

413
00:25:02.713 --> 00:25:04.052
What is it?

414
00:25:06.023 --> 00:25:07.193
Moo Gang...

415
00:25:08.552 --> 00:25:10.723
isn't Joon.

416
00:25:11.622 --> 00:25:12.793
I'm sorry?

417
00:25:13.223 --> 00:25:15.132
Kim Joon, your first love.

418
00:25:16.562 --> 00:25:18.763
It's not Moo Gang. It's his brother.

419
00:25:19.362 --> 00:25:22.332
Han Moo Chan. He's Moo Gang's stepbrother.

420
00:25:23.743 --> 00:25:25.372
I don't understand.

421
00:25:26.372 --> 00:25:28.412
I've never seen him in person,

422
00:25:29.173 --> 00:25:30.443
but Moo Gang once told me...

423
00:25:30.612 --> 00:25:33.652
that he had a brother from Moojin.

424
00:25:34.683 --> 00:25:36.582
His name was Kim Joon,

425
00:25:37.423 --> 00:25:39.082
but they changed it...

426
00:25:39.423 --> 00:25:42.622
to Han Moo Chan because he wanted to have his dad's last name.

427
00:25:43.352 --> 00:25:46.562
What happened to Joon then?

428
00:25:47.632 --> 00:25:49.162
Where is he now?

429
00:25:50.763 --> 00:25:51.963
I heard...

430
00:25:53.062 --> 00:25:55.632
he died a long time ago.

431
00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:10.322
He... He died?

432
00:26:12.523 --> 00:26:14.293
Did you just say...

433
00:26:17.293 --> 00:26:18.662
Joon died?

434
00:26:21.832 --> 00:26:23.802
At Moo Gang's place the other day,

435
00:26:23.963 --> 00:26:25.963
you called him Joon.

436
00:26:25.963 --> 00:26:28.602
I thought it was strange, so I asked him.

437
00:26:29.802 --> 00:26:31.572
He said he hid it from you on purpose.

438
00:26:33.302 --> 00:26:36.412
He said he wants to use you for his investigation,

439
00:26:37.683 --> 00:26:39.912
but you wouldn't help him if you found out the truth.

440
00:26:42.713 --> 00:26:44.052
He also asked me...

441
00:26:44.953 --> 00:26:47.493
to pretend not to know and not tell you.

442
00:26:51.162 --> 00:26:52.493
I'm... I'm sorry.

443
00:26:54.132 --> 00:26:56.332
This is why I couldn't tell you then,

444
00:26:57.963 --> 00:27:00.372
but I was worried about you.

445
00:27:06.302 --> 00:27:08.312
No. He...

446
00:27:09.112 --> 00:27:11.342
even wears the bracelet I gave him.

447
00:27:12.312 --> 00:27:14.812
He's wearing it because it's a keepsake from his late brother.

448
00:27:15.912 --> 00:27:17.552
That's what he told me.

449
00:27:26.023 --> 00:27:28.193
He still has the face he had when he was little.

450
00:27:30.102 --> 00:27:31.662
It just doesn't make sense.

451
00:27:38.673 --> 00:27:39.773
They're brothers.

452
00:27:40.412 --> 00:27:42.112
They look very much alike.

453
00:28:04.263 --> 00:28:07.203
I can't believe not one of them knows where Kim Sun Young is.

454
00:28:08.203 --> 00:28:09.602
Is she even alive?

455
00:28:14.372 --> 00:28:17.412
But why is that brat hovering around them all night?

456
00:28:23.783 --> 00:28:25.582
Goodness! Get off me!

457
00:28:25.882 --> 00:28:27.152
Hey, get off me!

458
00:28:27.923 --> 00:28:30.322
- Are you crazy? - Yes. Come here.

459
00:28:30.322 --> 00:28:32.092
Let go of me!

460
00:28:32.662 --> 00:28:34.193
Are you on their team?

461
00:28:34.193 --> 00:28:37.463
Why are you so interested in their case like a beggar?

462
00:28:37.463 --> 00:28:38.662
Don't you have any pride?

463
00:28:38.662 --> 00:28:42.372
Try to catch the one who killed Han Jin Sook instead.

464
00:28:42.372 --> 00:28:44.602
We need to get some results too.

465
00:28:49.842 --> 00:28:52.342
My gosh, he's sulky again.

466
00:28:52.842 --> 00:28:55.652
Hey. Did you think about the thing I told you about?

467
00:28:55.652 --> 00:28:57.382
- What? - You little...

468
00:28:58.582 --> 00:29:00.392
I'm talking about the skeleton!

469
00:29:00.493 --> 00:29:02.822
Why did you hide it? Why did you go to Moojin Girls' Middle School?

470
00:29:03.892 --> 00:29:05.062
I can't remember.

471
00:29:05.062 --> 00:29:06.223
You brat.

472
00:29:06.592 --> 00:29:08.562
Is there a politician in your family?

473
00:29:08.763 --> 00:29:11.463
You can't remember? Is that the best you can do?

474
00:29:11.463 --> 00:29:13.973
You have to remember it!

475
00:29:14.602 --> 00:29:15.802
Joon.

476
00:29:17.443 --> 00:29:19.372
What is it? We haven't found anything yet.

477
00:29:19.372 --> 00:29:22.243
- I said I'll call you if we do. - Can I talk to you?

478
00:29:31.582 --> 00:29:35.052
I know you're worried. I'll call you if we find something.

479
00:29:41.362 --> 00:29:42.632
Joon.

480
00:29:43.332 --> 00:29:44.463
What?

481
00:29:47.832 --> 00:29:48.902
"What"?

482
00:29:56.372 --> 00:29:57.783
How despicable.

483
00:30:08.193 --> 00:30:09.523
My Joon.

484
00:30:11.322 --> 00:30:12.763
Is he really dead?

485
00:30:14.033 --> 00:30:15.332
Did he really die?

486
00:30:24.203 --> 00:30:26.072
- Well... - Is he dead or not?

487
00:30:37.453 --> 00:30:38.582
Yes, apparently.

488
00:30:40.423 --> 00:30:42.092
You mean jerk.

489
00:31:03.683 --> 00:31:07.013
What did he do wrong to get slapped by her like that?

490
00:31:08.453 --> 00:31:11.183
My gosh, he must've gotten himself into trouble.

491
00:31:12.852 --> 00:31:13.953
What?

492
00:31:18.822 --> 00:31:19.892
My gosh.

493
00:31:21.062 --> 00:31:22.062
This boy...

494
00:31:23.725 --> 00:31:25.554
- Hey. - Here.

495
00:31:27.794 --> 00:31:29.195
It's him.

496
00:31:29.195 --> 00:31:32.465
But why does Moo Gang have a photo of this boy?

497
00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:39.135
Moo Gang?

498
00:31:39.905 --> 00:31:41.705
What's he doing here?

499
00:31:41.975 --> 00:31:44.244
Moo Gang went there that day to meet him.

500
00:31:45.675 --> 00:31:47.584
Which hospital did Moo Gang's mother work at?

501
00:31:49.084 --> 00:31:51.215
Do you know him?

502
00:31:51.754 --> 00:31:52.885
No.

503
00:31:53.215 --> 00:31:55.725
It's just an identikit, so it's not perfectly correct.

504
00:31:55.824 --> 00:31:58.324
But he has a hook-shaped scar on his right cheek.

505
00:31:58.324 --> 00:31:59.925
I've never seen this man before.

506
00:32:00.494 --> 00:32:01.865
But who is he?

507
00:32:01.865 --> 00:32:04.734
Well, he's a mental patient who recently killed someone...

508
00:32:04.734 --> 00:32:06.294
and escaped from the mental hospital.

509
00:32:06.294 --> 00:32:08.465
We're assuming that he could've killed someone else last night too.

510
00:32:08.465 --> 00:32:09.534
What?

511
00:32:09.834 --> 00:32:13.205
Right before this guy escaped from the mental hospital,

512
00:32:14.074 --> 00:32:16.044
it seemed like he was trying...

513
00:32:16.044 --> 00:32:18.215
to get rid of this by burning it and throwing it in the toilet.

514
00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:21.115
But thankfully, we were able to find it.

515
00:32:21.115 --> 00:32:24.284
Why... Why did he have a photo of Moo Chan?

516
00:32:24.284 --> 00:32:26.155
That's what I was curious about.

517
00:32:27.554 --> 00:32:30.994
I think Detective Han went to see him, showed him this photo,

518
00:32:30.994 --> 00:32:33.524
and left it there before having lost his memory...

519
00:32:33.524 --> 00:32:35.794
due to the accident.

520
00:32:35.895 --> 00:32:38.764
- What? - It's just my assumption.

521
00:32:38.764 --> 00:32:40.234
I think he was in the middle of...

522
00:32:40.234 --> 00:32:43.165
investigating something by himself before he had lost his memory.

523
00:32:43.534 --> 00:32:45.834
Do you remember anything from back then?

524
00:32:45.905 --> 00:32:48.205
I think he also went to Moojin a couple of times.

525
00:32:50.274 --> 00:32:51.445
"Moojin"?

526
00:32:51.445 --> 00:32:54.115
Yes. Do you know what it could've been about?

527
00:32:54.115 --> 00:32:58.054
Yes. That's where his older brother got into an accident.

528
00:32:58.054 --> 00:32:59.185
Really?

529
00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:00.254
Yes.

530
00:33:00.254 --> 00:33:03.125
I had to attend a seminar in Moojin,

531
00:33:03.395 --> 00:33:06.254
and the kids didn't have to go to school that day,

532
00:33:06.254 --> 00:33:08.795
so I took them with me to Moojin.

533
00:33:08.795 --> 00:33:11.065
Rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors.

534
00:33:11.165 --> 00:33:12.565
Rock-paper-scissors.

535
00:33:12.634 --> 00:33:14.605
Hey, you guys. Look outside.

536
00:33:15.364 --> 00:33:17.074
Let's take a photo here.

537
00:33:18.304 --> 00:33:21.904
Look over here, you two. Put your arms around each other.

538
00:33:22.605 --> 00:33:24.344
Look here.

539
00:33:30.784 --> 00:33:34.185
(April 16th, 1997)

540
00:33:34.924 --> 00:33:37.255
I heard you were going to attend the seminar.

541
00:33:38.094 --> 00:33:39.924
Long time no see, Doctor Min.

542
00:33:40.395 --> 00:33:42.824
It feels like yesterday when you used to be my intern.

543
00:33:42.824 --> 00:33:45.634
How is it being a resident? It's hard, isn't it?

544
00:33:45.634 --> 00:33:49.105
No, it's okay. I'll get going now.

545
00:33:50.404 --> 00:33:51.835
What? Wait.

546
00:33:58.344 --> 00:33:59.545
Hello?

547
00:34:00.645 --> 00:34:02.214
Hey, Moo Gang. What were you doing?

548
00:34:02.844 --> 00:34:06.214
I see. I'll be there as soon as I'm done with my seminar,

549
00:34:06.214 --> 00:34:07.485
so have fun with your brother...

550
00:34:09.884 --> 00:34:11.654
By the way,

551
00:34:11.955 --> 00:34:14.194
ask your brother to take you around Moojin.

552
00:34:14.324 --> 00:34:15.764
I'll see you later.

553
00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:19.034
Excuse me. What happened?

554
00:34:19.034 --> 00:34:20.134
Didn't you see the news?

555
00:34:20.134 --> 00:34:22.464
- Moojin Time Mart just collapsed. - What?

556
00:34:22.464 --> 00:34:26.404
Casualties from the collapse of Moojin Time Mart kept coming in.

557
00:34:26.404 --> 00:34:28.705
And there was a shortage of doctors.

558
00:34:28.705 --> 00:34:32.375
So I ended up working at the hospital for four days straight.

559
00:34:41.625 --> 00:34:45.225
I couldn't take care of my children for days like that.

560
00:34:45.494 --> 00:34:48.565
Then I got a call in the middle of the night from an unknown number.

561
00:34:55.565 --> 00:34:56.634
Hello?

562
00:35:00.705 --> 00:35:02.545
Yes, I'm Moo Chan's mother...

563
00:35:08.114 --> 00:35:12.154
Moo Chan got into a car accident?

564
00:35:17.824 --> 00:35:19.194
This photo ended up...

565
00:35:20.565 --> 00:35:23.025
being Moo Chan's last photo.

566
00:35:23.025 --> 00:35:24.994
What kind of accident was it?

567
00:35:28.235 --> 00:35:30.975
It was a hit-and-run accident. We couldn't catch who it was.

568
00:35:31.304 --> 00:35:33.605
I see. I'm sorry.

569
00:35:34.574 --> 00:35:36.975
Then that means Detective Han's brother died...

570
00:35:36.975 --> 00:35:38.815
four days after the collapse...

571
00:35:38.815 --> 00:35:40.645
of Moojin Time Mart. Is that correct?

572
00:35:41.014 --> 00:35:42.014
Yes.

573
00:35:43.145 --> 00:35:45.585
I got a call exactly at dawn, just when it was about to...

574
00:35:45.585 --> 00:35:47.125
become the fifth day.

575
00:35:47.755 --> 00:35:48.985
I see.

576
00:35:50.494 --> 00:35:54.395
Okay, I'll call you if I have any other questions.

577
00:35:54.395 --> 00:35:56.065
Thank you.

578
00:36:02.565 --> 00:36:03.935
Nice.

579
00:36:04.304 --> 00:36:05.804
What is this?

580
00:36:05.935 --> 00:36:07.205
What got into him?

581
00:36:07.205 --> 00:36:09.344
Humans tend to do stuff to forget about...

582
00:36:09.344 --> 00:36:11.915
their worries and stress.

583
00:36:13.014 --> 00:36:15.944
He's following exactly what humans do.

584
00:36:16.244 --> 00:36:19.185
That's because he used to be human.

585
00:36:19.384 --> 00:36:20.855
Hey, you're here.

586
00:36:21.085 --> 00:36:23.895
Do you want me to show you something nice?

587
00:36:23.895 --> 00:36:25.795
Come here. Come on.

588
00:36:28.225 --> 00:36:29.364
Come on.

589
00:36:29.424 --> 00:36:31.165
How do they look?

590
00:36:31.165 --> 00:36:34.505
I used all of Moo Gang's credit cards.

591
00:36:37.275 --> 00:36:39.534
How do they look? They look nice, don't they?

592
00:36:41.545 --> 00:36:44.545
It's here. It's finally here.

593
00:36:50.054 --> 00:36:52.585
I love intestine soup.

594
00:36:54.485 --> 00:36:55.654
Gosh, it tastes great.

595
00:36:55.654 --> 00:36:58.324
I feel sorry for you. You can't taste something so delicious.

596
00:36:59.725 --> 00:37:01.424
Are you really okay?

597
00:37:02.824 --> 00:37:05.594
That lady said she's never going to see you again.

598
00:37:08.764 --> 00:37:10.674
At first, I was worried that...

599
00:37:10.674 --> 00:37:13.404
I won't be able to find that loser without her help.

600
00:37:13.404 --> 00:37:15.844
But come to think of it, she's of no help at all.

601
00:37:15.844 --> 00:37:17.244
She gets nothing done properly.

602
00:37:17.244 --> 00:37:19.744
I figured that she's just a huge burden to me.

603
00:37:21.485 --> 00:37:23.355
And who am I?

604
00:37:23.855 --> 00:37:25.915
I'm 444.

605
00:37:25.915 --> 00:37:29.585
I can find that loser even without the help of a mere human being.

606
00:37:31.355 --> 00:37:33.054
Did you really...

607
00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:36.125
stick by her side solely because of that loser?

608
00:37:38.565 --> 00:37:39.634
What?

609
00:37:41.134 --> 00:37:43.674
Why else would I have stayed by her side?

610
00:37:46.275 --> 00:37:48.645
Whatever. I'm tired. Go away.

611
00:37:49.775 --> 00:37:51.375
Get lost.

612
00:37:52.014 --> 00:37:54.844
What? You want me to get lost?

613
00:37:55.844 --> 00:37:58.855
How can you say that to me? I have nowhere to go right now.

614
00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:03.895
Hey, I wasn't talking to you right now.

615
00:38:03.895 --> 00:38:05.824
Are you kidding me? Then who were you talking to?

616
00:38:05.824 --> 00:38:07.625
There's no one else in this room but me.

617
00:38:07.625 --> 00:38:08.924
You're so mean.

618
00:38:08.924 --> 00:38:10.964
I even put my issues behind...

619
00:38:10.964 --> 00:38:13.235
so that I could help you and Ms. Fortune-teller...

620
00:38:13.235 --> 00:38:14.764
find that murderer.

621
00:38:15.634 --> 00:38:16.705
What?

622
00:38:17.804 --> 00:38:21.404
I'm not looking for him anymore, so don't talk about her in front of me.

623
00:38:25.145 --> 00:38:26.145
Wait.

624
00:38:27.915 --> 00:38:30.915
But how did you know that we were looking for him?

625
00:38:30.915 --> 00:38:31.915
What?

626
00:38:31.985 --> 00:38:33.355
Did she come here?

627
00:38:33.355 --> 00:38:35.225
Did she take a photo or something?

628
00:38:35.225 --> 00:38:38.955
No. She told me about the case over the phone.

629
00:38:39.455 --> 00:38:42.464
By the way, your fiancee came to see you.

630
00:38:42.464 --> 00:38:44.235
I think she took something from the drawer.

631
00:38:44.795 --> 00:38:45.935
What?

632
00:38:51.074 --> 00:38:53.775
I knew it. I knew it was that human doctor.

633
00:38:54.304 --> 00:38:57.674
My gosh, I shouldn't have trusted that human doctor.

634
00:39:03.045 --> 00:39:07.054
What's his problem? Why would he call his own fiancee a human doctor?

635
00:39:07.725 --> 00:39:10.255
He's so weird. He's not normal at all.

636
00:39:11.094 --> 00:39:13.194
He's mean and arrogant.

637
00:39:15.665 --> 00:39:16.994
My Joon.

638
00:39:18.764 --> 00:39:20.065
Is he really dead?

639
00:39:21.235 --> 00:39:22.705
Did he really die?

640
00:39:27.729 --> 00:39:30.961
<font color="#80ffff">[VIU Ver] E12 Black "I'll Never Forgive You"</font>
<font color="#ff00ff">-= Ruo Xi =-</font>

641
00:39:35.384 --> 00:39:37.915
Oh, right. It was the day when they found...

642
00:39:38.014 --> 00:39:40.324
Woo Byung Sik's body.

643
00:39:40.324 --> 00:39:44.054
We never saw Clara and Sun Young after that day.

644
00:39:44.194 --> 00:39:47.424
Jin Sook also disappeared after that.

645
00:39:47.424 --> 00:39:52.764
The body was found in April 19th, 1997.

646
00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:01.174
Let's see.

647
00:40:02.344 --> 00:40:05.114
Clara, Han Jin Sook, and Kim Sun Young all disappeared...

648
00:40:05.545 --> 00:40:08.645
in the evening of April 19th, 1997.

649
00:40:10.315 --> 00:40:13.525
And Moo Gang's older brother's corpse was found...

650
00:40:13.525 --> 00:40:16.485
the next day at 4am on April 20th.

651
00:40:19.855 --> 00:40:22.824
Clara was found dead in this factory.

652
00:40:22.824 --> 00:40:25.994
And Moo Gang's brother was found dead on this road,

653
00:40:27.005 --> 00:40:30.205
which is only 1.1km away from the factory.

654
00:40:31.375 --> 00:40:32.705
1.1km.

655
00:40:33.775 --> 00:40:36.344
It's either a 1 minute drive or a 10 minute walk.

656
00:40:46.214 --> 00:40:47.485
Is this Moojin Police Station?

657
00:40:47.585 --> 00:40:49.525
Hey, Detective Choi. It's me.

658
00:40:50.094 --> 00:40:51.355
Please do me a favor.

659
00:40:52.194 --> 00:40:54.565
If you look through the statute-barred cases,

660
00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:58.094
you'll be able to find a hit-and-run accident that happened...

661
00:40:58.094 --> 00:41:00.235
around 4am on April 20, 1997.

662
00:41:00.634 --> 00:41:03.375
The victim's name is Han Moo Chan, and his original name is Kim Joon.

663
00:41:03.435 --> 00:41:06.034
Can you send me the investigation files via email right now?

664
00:41:06.505 --> 00:41:08.005
Okay. Thank you.

665
00:41:15.014 --> 00:41:16.344
I'm sure...

666
00:41:17.214 --> 00:41:19.315
these two cases are correlated with each other.

667
00:41:20.755 --> 00:41:23.755
That's why Detective Han looked into both cases at once.

668
00:41:26.725 --> 00:41:30.034
But why did he go to Hope Mental Hospital?

669
00:41:36.105 --> 00:41:37.205
Does this guy...

670
00:41:38.074 --> 00:41:40.545
also have something to do with Clara and Kim Joon's death?

671
00:42:09.964 --> 00:42:12.074
A planned murder?

672
00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:27.355
Ms. Fortune-teller.

673
00:42:38.665 --> 00:42:39.835
Let's go see Joon.

674
00:42:40.665 --> 00:42:43.475
Let go of me. He's not Joon.

675
00:42:45.705 --> 00:42:46.775
I'm talking about the real Joon.

676
00:43:08.725 --> 00:43:10.494
(Han Moo Chan)

677
00:43:11.565 --> 00:43:13.065
(Han Moo Chan)

678
00:43:15.005 --> 00:43:16.364
Joon.

679
00:43:20.205 --> 00:43:21.505
That jerk...

680
00:43:22.105 --> 00:43:25.045
knew that Joon's ashes were kept here.

681
00:43:25.045 --> 00:43:27.514
(Han Moo Chan)

682
00:43:32.585 --> 00:43:33.884
(Han Moo Chan)

683
00:43:33.884 --> 00:43:35.884
I didn't even know you were here.

684
00:43:36.225 --> 00:43:37.625
I had no idea.

685
00:43:38.625 --> 00:43:41.964
I prayed so much that I'd be able to meet you.

686
00:43:41.964 --> 00:43:43.165
But I was stupid enough...

687
00:43:43.264 --> 00:43:45.335
to think that someone else was you.

688
00:43:46.864 --> 00:43:48.435
I was foolishly mistaken.

689
00:43:49.665 --> 00:43:50.775
I'm sorry.

690
00:43:51.634 --> 00:43:54.145
Why did you have to die like this too?

691
00:43:54.605 --> 00:43:56.045
Even my dad's dead.

692
00:44:01.415 --> 00:44:02.744
Why did you die?

693
00:44:23.304 --> 00:44:24.435
Why caused...

694
00:44:25.775 --> 00:44:27.244
Joon's death?

695
00:44:27.344 --> 00:44:28.775
Well...

696
00:44:32.944 --> 00:44:35.014
Hey, wake up.

697
00:44:35.014 --> 00:44:37.114
Gosh, why?

698
00:44:37.614 --> 00:44:39.585
Leave me alone when I sleep.

699
00:44:39.585 --> 00:44:41.585
You need to take Ha Ram somewhere.

700
00:44:41.585 --> 00:44:42.585
Where?

701
00:44:43.525 --> 00:44:44.795
Take her to Kim Joon.

702
00:44:45.025 --> 00:44:47.094
It was a hit-and-run accident. They failed to catch the culprit.

703
00:44:47.795 --> 00:44:49.924
The truth will hurt her, so just tell her that it was an accident.

704
00:44:51.594 --> 00:44:55.205
Apparently, he was in a car accident.

705
00:44:58.574 --> 00:45:00.005
I didn't even know that.

706
00:45:00.844 --> 00:45:03.205
I feel so ashamed and apologetic.

707
00:45:04.244 --> 00:45:07.614
Why do you feel that way? You missed him so much.

708
00:45:07.815 --> 00:45:11.114
What's the use? I didn't even recognize him properly.

709
00:45:12.114 --> 00:45:14.784
I mistook someone else as Joon.

710
00:45:15.255 --> 00:45:17.525
I feel like Joon must've been...

711
00:45:18.125 --> 00:45:19.395
completely dumbfounded.

712
00:45:19.395 --> 00:45:21.065
I'm not going to let that jerk get away with this.

713
00:45:21.395 --> 00:45:23.335
He fooled me and took advantage of me.

714
00:45:24.594 --> 00:45:25.964
I can never forgive him for that.

715
00:45:28.264 --> 00:45:31.005
I'm sure he didn't fool you on purpose.

716
00:45:31.904 --> 00:45:33.475
He lost his memory because of the accident.

717
00:45:33.904 --> 00:45:36.105
So he probably thought he was Joon at first...

718
00:45:36.105 --> 00:45:39.674
because you kept calling him that.

719
00:45:39.674 --> 00:45:40.844
Let's say he did.

720
00:45:41.315 --> 00:45:42.685
But he found out the truth later on.

721
00:45:43.085 --> 00:45:45.685
He kept lying to me even when he knew that he wasn't Joon.

722
00:45:45.714 --> 00:45:47.554
He pretended like he was Joon.

723
00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:49.585
Although he found out,

724
00:45:50.054 --> 00:45:51.795
he probably missed the right timing to tell you.

725
00:45:51.795 --> 00:45:54.494
It must've been hard for him to keep lying to you as well.

726
00:45:54.625 --> 00:45:55.665
No.

727
00:45:55.994 --> 00:45:58.895
That jerk took advantage of me.

728
00:46:00.235 --> 00:46:01.264
How is she?

729
00:46:01.264 --> 00:46:03.105
Don't worry. She visited Kim Joon.

730
00:46:03.534 --> 00:46:04.935
I'll take her back safely.

731
00:46:05.375 --> 00:46:06.875
- Hey. - Yes?

732
00:46:07.804 --> 00:46:08.944
Thank you.

733
00:46:14.514 --> 00:46:17.214
I can't believe this arrogant jerk just thanked me.

734
00:46:36.975 --> 00:46:39.074
- What? - Aren't you going to come to work?

735
00:46:40.545 --> 00:46:41.574
I'm sick.

736
00:46:41.574 --> 00:46:44.014
Cut that nonsense. Get over here right now.

737
00:46:44.815 --> 00:46:46.545
Your older brother's birth mother's here.

738
00:46:46.985 --> 00:46:48.214
You better get over here right now.

739
00:46:55.585 --> 00:46:56.755
Detective Han.

740
00:47:00.464 --> 00:47:01.895
What's this smell?

741
00:47:03.025 --> 00:47:04.034
What is it?

742
00:47:04.795 --> 00:47:06.565
I came in the middle of delivering fish.

743
00:47:06.935 --> 00:47:08.665
I should've gotten changed.

744
00:47:08.904 --> 00:47:10.505
She's your older brother's birth mother.

745
00:47:12.105 --> 00:47:14.074
She's Kim Joon's mother?

746
00:47:15.444 --> 00:47:16.815
Detective Han?

747
00:47:18.114 --> 00:47:19.844
Who are you? Do you know me?

748
00:47:21.315 --> 00:47:24.315
No. I must've mistaken you for someone else.

749
00:47:26.985 --> 00:47:28.355
What are you doing? Sit down.

750
00:47:33.094 --> 00:47:35.424
I want you to listen to what she has to say.

751
00:47:35.525 --> 00:47:39.435
Then tell me right away if there's anything you remember. Okay?

752
00:47:41.705 --> 00:47:45.674
You're Han Moo Chan's birth mother, right?

753
00:47:50.375 --> 00:47:51.844
He's your son, right?

754
00:47:53.014 --> 00:47:54.114
My baby.

755
00:47:55.085 --> 00:47:56.444
My poor baby.

756
00:47:57.384 --> 00:47:58.384
I'm sorry.

757
00:48:01.185 --> 00:48:04.395
Was Joon raised by his father?

758
00:48:07.025 --> 00:48:08.565
I raised him at first.

759
00:48:10.694 --> 00:48:12.264
But there was a situation.

760
00:48:20.304 --> 00:48:21.505
Search every single corner!

761
00:48:21.505 --> 00:48:22.875
What are you doing?

762
00:48:23.045 --> 00:48:24.244
We received a report.

763
00:48:24.244 --> 00:48:26.685
What report? What report?

764
00:48:27.915 --> 00:48:29.614
Why are you going through my child's room?

765
00:48:30.714 --> 00:48:31.884
Let me go.

766
00:48:32.014 --> 00:48:33.725
- Let me go! - You can't be like this.

767
00:48:35.554 --> 00:48:36.755
That's mine.

768
00:48:38.094 --> 00:48:39.625
I put it in there.

769
00:48:39.855 --> 00:48:41.625
- Arrest her. - Yes, sir.

770
00:48:42.094 --> 00:48:43.264
Ma'am.

771
00:48:44.295 --> 00:48:46.464
No! No!

772
00:48:46.464 --> 00:48:50.034
Let me go! Let go of me! No, you can't go.

773
00:48:50.034 --> 00:48:51.375
- What are you doing? - Joon.

774
00:48:51.375 --> 00:48:52.534
Why are you taking my mom?

775
00:48:52.775 --> 00:48:54.645
She's been charged for possessing drugs. Get out of the way.

776
00:48:55.275 --> 00:48:57.645
- Joon. - Ma'am, no!

777
00:48:57.645 --> 00:48:59.174
- Joon. - You even do drugs now?

778
00:48:59.275 --> 00:49:00.784
Don't even call my name anymore.

779
00:49:00.784 --> 00:49:02.545
I'm so embarrassed of you!

780
00:49:02.545 --> 00:49:05.054
Joon, how can you say that to her?

781
00:49:08.525 --> 00:49:10.194
- My gosh. - What's going on?

782
00:49:10.755 --> 00:49:12.694
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly like this.

783
00:49:14.494 --> 00:49:15.895
I couldn't think of...

784
00:49:17.435 --> 00:49:19.594
anywhere else to send Joon.

785
00:49:22.335 --> 00:49:23.975
It must've been shocking news to you.

786
00:49:25.005 --> 00:49:27.505
It did surprise me a little.

787
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:33.014
By the way, how did Professor Han pass away?

788
00:49:35.485 --> 00:49:36.685
He passed away...

789
00:49:37.514 --> 00:49:39.054
from a heart disease last year.

790
00:49:42.025 --> 00:49:44.955
- I'm sorry. I had no idea. - Don't worry.

791
00:49:45.025 --> 00:49:46.094
Joon...

792
00:49:47.795 --> 00:49:49.295
I'll look after him.

793
00:49:49.464 --> 00:49:51.435
But a few days before I was released,

794
00:49:52.534 --> 00:49:54.864
I heard that Joon died.

795
00:49:54.864 --> 00:49:59.034
Why did you tell the police that the accident was premeditated murder...

796
00:49:59.034 --> 00:50:00.944
and not a simple hit-and-run case?

797
00:50:00.944 --> 00:50:02.074
Well...

798
00:50:04.614 --> 00:50:05.915
What is this?

799
00:50:05.915 --> 00:50:07.514
It was found in Joon's backpack,

800
00:50:07.514 --> 00:50:09.944
which he was wearing on the day of the accident.

801
00:50:13.085 --> 00:50:14.654
These are... Aren't these pens?

802
00:50:14.654 --> 00:50:17.594
No, they're not. What should I call them?

803
00:50:18.725 --> 00:50:20.565
They're some sort of smoke bombs.

804
00:50:20.565 --> 00:50:22.295
- Smoke bombs? - Yes.

805
00:50:23.594 --> 00:50:28.065
There was a detective Joon was very fond of like his own dad.

806
00:50:29.235 --> 00:50:32.975
Joon used to hang out with punks and misbehave himself,

807
00:50:33.545 --> 00:50:37.114
but he changed after meeting that detective, so I was very happy.

808
00:50:37.114 --> 00:50:38.444
All right. It's done.

809
00:50:39.145 --> 00:50:41.045
It just looks like a pen.

810
00:50:41.045 --> 00:50:43.284
Are you saying pressing it will make the smoke bomb go off?

811
00:50:43.284 --> 00:50:44.355
Of course.

812
00:50:44.554 --> 00:50:45.784
It's true.

813
00:50:46.185 --> 00:50:49.255
Daddy said that he's making those bombs so that his station...

814
00:50:49.255 --> 00:50:52.125
can distribute them to residents for emergency situations.

815
00:50:52.554 --> 00:50:54.824
All right. The red pen...

816
00:50:54.824 --> 00:50:57.295
should be pressed when there's a fire.

817
00:50:57.295 --> 00:51:00.804
The yellow one is for when someone is trying to harm you.

818
00:51:01.665 --> 00:51:02.804
Press it in such situations.

819
00:51:03.335 --> 00:51:05.335
And use this green one...

820
00:51:05.505 --> 00:51:07.275
when you're feeling ill.

821
00:51:14.714 --> 00:51:18.415
Joon made the yellow one go off by mistake that day,

822
00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:21.054
so I spent the rest of the day trying to get rid of the smoke.

823
00:51:21.054 --> 00:51:22.054
What is this?

824
00:51:22.054 --> 00:51:25.194
That's why I remember it clearly. The yellow smoke bomb.

825
00:51:38.404 --> 00:51:41.304
I'm certain of it. The pen was already used.

826
00:51:41.645 --> 00:51:43.005
That's when I became convinced.

827
00:51:43.005 --> 00:51:45.815
If Joon made the yellow bomb go off,

828
00:51:46.074 --> 00:51:49.915
it means that he was being chased by someone,

829
00:51:49.915 --> 00:51:53.154
and that person must've intentionally hit him with the car.

830
00:51:55.485 --> 00:51:58.395
Then what did the detective who made these smoke bombs say?

831
00:51:58.395 --> 00:52:00.525
I obviously went to talk to him immediately after the accident,

832
00:52:02.065 --> 00:52:05.464
but I found out that he also died from an accident.

833
00:52:05.464 --> 00:52:06.735
Gosh, he's dead.

834
00:52:07.804 --> 00:52:10.034
Do you happen to know that detective's name?

835
00:52:10.034 --> 00:52:11.775
I don't remember it because it was too long ago.

836
00:52:12.634 --> 00:52:14.674
I think he introduced himself as Detective Kang.

837
00:52:15.205 --> 00:52:16.304
Detective Kang Soo Hyuk?

838
00:52:16.304 --> 00:52:17.475
Yes, that's right.

839
00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:20.384
Do you know him?

840
00:52:22.714 --> 00:52:26.824
Yes, I do. I also worked in Moojin a long time ago.

841
00:52:31.025 --> 00:52:34.594
By the way, you said that you had a bar in Moojin, right?

842
00:52:34.594 --> 00:52:35.864
Whereabouts in Moojin was it?

843
00:52:36.165 --> 00:52:38.295
You must know it if you used to work in Moojin.

844
00:52:38.295 --> 00:52:41.034
It was under Mount Moojin by all those abandoned factories.

845
00:52:41.105 --> 00:52:43.534
Then do you know Clara by any chance?

846
00:52:43.804 --> 00:52:47.344
Clara? We were like sisters.

847
00:52:47.375 --> 00:52:49.944
Then do you also know the girls who used to work at that bar?

848
00:52:49.944 --> 00:52:51.815
Han Jin Sook and Kim Sun Young.

849
00:52:51.815 --> 00:52:53.014
Sun Young?

850
00:52:53.784 --> 00:52:56.614
Of course I know her. I practically raised her like my own daughter.

851
00:52:57.514 --> 00:52:59.355
She's my friend's daughter,

852
00:52:59.884 --> 00:53:02.185
but her parents died in a car accident,

853
00:53:02.455 --> 00:53:04.125
so I took her in and raised her.

854
00:53:06.994 --> 00:53:08.795
When I got arrested,

855
00:53:09.565 --> 00:53:11.895
I sent Joon to his dad's place in Seoul,

856
00:53:11.994 --> 00:53:14.034
but I didn't have anywhere to send Sun Young,

857
00:53:14.034 --> 00:53:15.605
so I asked Clara to take care of her.

858
00:53:16.605 --> 00:53:20.045
Clara said that she'd make her do chores and send her to school.

859
00:53:20.045 --> 00:53:21.975
Where is Kim Sun Young now?

860
00:53:23.614 --> 00:53:24.714
Actually,

861
00:53:25.574 --> 00:53:29.045
I went to Clara's place because I wondered if Joon met Sun Young...

862
00:53:29.244 --> 00:53:30.654
on the day of the accident.

863
00:53:31.154 --> 00:53:33.485
But everything was closed in that area...

864
00:53:33.485 --> 00:53:35.284
because of the police's prostitution crackdown.

865
00:53:35.554 --> 00:53:38.795
I asked around, but no one knew where Clara and Sun Young were.

866
00:53:44.295 --> 00:53:46.464
(Mother)

867
00:53:57.514 --> 00:54:01.145
The person you have reached is not available. Please leave a message...

868
00:54:02.985 --> 00:54:04.855
She's not even picking up.

869
00:54:05.485 --> 00:54:07.125
This is so unlike her.

870
00:54:09.185 --> 00:54:11.054
What if something happened to her?

871
00:54:13.565 --> 00:54:14.625
Gosh.

872
00:54:15.864 --> 00:54:17.764
Where's my charger?

873
00:54:25.205 --> 00:54:27.205
What is this?

874
00:54:32.514 --> 00:54:33.744
What are you doing?

875
00:54:34.214 --> 00:54:38.255
Why are you touching my stuff without my permission?

876
00:54:38.415 --> 00:54:39.614
Well, I was just...

877
00:54:39.614 --> 00:54:42.654
I just thought that we could go home together.

878
00:54:43.625 --> 00:54:45.424
Doctor, there's an emergency patient.

879
00:54:45.625 --> 00:54:46.895
Go home before me.

880
00:54:48.264 --> 00:54:52.395
Even Moo Gang's mother didn't believe me,

881
00:54:52.395 --> 00:54:55.964
but I finally met someone who believes me after 20 years.

882
00:54:56.705 --> 00:54:58.105
I recognized him right away.

883
00:54:58.475 --> 00:55:00.545
He resembles his dad a lot.

884
00:55:01.674 --> 00:55:05.744
I thought that Joon would look like him if he was alive.

885
00:55:05.744 --> 00:55:09.284
I contacted you while going through reports about my brother's accident.

886
00:55:10.714 --> 00:55:13.985
The accident that killed Joon wasn't a hit-and-run.

887
00:55:14.585 --> 00:55:15.955
He was murdered.

888
00:55:20.494 --> 00:55:21.795
You don't believe me, do you?

889
00:55:21.795 --> 00:55:22.895
I do.

890
00:55:24.364 --> 00:55:25.534
I believe you.

891
00:55:26.964 --> 00:55:28.034
I do believe you.

892
00:55:30.634 --> 00:55:31.705
Actually,

893
00:55:33.275 --> 00:55:35.605
I think I have an idea of what happened that day.

894
00:55:35.605 --> 00:55:36.714
Really?

895
00:55:37.674 --> 00:55:39.614
What on earth happened?

896
00:55:39.614 --> 00:55:41.315
I'll tell you everything later on.

897
00:55:45.455 --> 00:55:47.985
I'm sorry. I should've come to see you sooner.

898
00:55:53.125 --> 00:55:55.594
I know that it's very late,

899
00:55:56.994 --> 00:55:58.994
but I'll reveal the truth about my brother's death...

900
00:56:00.505 --> 00:56:02.005
at all costs.

901
00:56:08.775 --> 00:56:10.944
He said that he had a good job in the States,

902
00:56:12.375 --> 00:56:14.085
but he quit right away,

903
00:56:14.585 --> 00:56:17.114
took the police exam, and joined the police force.

904
00:56:18.054 --> 00:56:20.185
Moo Gang told me that there's something he had to do.

905
00:56:20.924 --> 00:56:23.225
It must've been revealing the truth about his brother's death.

906
00:56:25.455 --> 00:56:27.494
But Detective Han called me one day...

907
00:56:27.994 --> 00:56:30.134
and said that he found out who killed his brother.

908
00:56:30.335 --> 00:56:31.764
- He did? - Yes.

909
00:56:31.764 --> 00:56:34.435
He said he'd call me again after securing firm evidence,

910
00:56:34.435 --> 00:56:36.205
but I didn't hear back from him for quite a while,

911
00:56:36.605 --> 00:56:39.574
so I called him about a month ago.

912
00:56:39.574 --> 00:56:43.205
Then he said that he was on his way to find evidence and hung up.

913
00:56:43.205 --> 00:56:44.214
What happened after that?

914
00:56:44.214 --> 00:56:45.975
I couldn't get a hold of him after that.

915
00:56:45.975 --> 00:56:47.685
I kept calling him, but he didn't pick up.

916
00:56:50.384 --> 00:56:51.415
Then recently,

917
00:56:53.054 --> 00:56:56.525
I heard about the accident from his mother.

918
00:56:56.654 --> 00:56:58.225
She said that he lost his memory.

919
00:57:01.895 --> 00:57:03.694
He found evidence?

920
00:57:04.534 --> 00:57:05.694
Han Moo Gang did?

921
00:57:06.565 --> 00:57:08.404
When did you call him?

922
00:57:09.034 --> 00:57:10.404
Just a moment, please.

923
00:57:12.034 --> 00:57:14.404
Oh, it was October 14th.

924
00:57:14.475 --> 00:57:15.944
October 14th?

925
00:57:16.505 --> 00:57:18.375
October 14th...

926
00:57:19.244 --> 00:57:21.614
That was the day you were in the hostage situation.

927
00:57:22.884 --> 00:57:24.214
May I look at your phone for a second?

928
00:57:27.855 --> 00:57:29.525
4:27pm?

929
00:57:36.113 --> 00:57:38.243
Where's Doctor Min? I think it's cardiac arrest.

930
00:57:38.343 --> 00:57:40.252
- Get the defibrillator... - Doctor Min, it's cardiac arrest.

931
00:57:40.252 --> 00:57:41.312
Move.

932
00:57:47.193 --> 00:57:48.892
- Really? - Yes.

933
00:57:48.892 --> 00:57:51.993
The speeding ticket was issued on the day of the accident.

934
00:57:53.062 --> 00:57:54.792
What? 120 dollars?

935
00:57:54.792 --> 00:57:57.562
"October 14th. Gangjeong Intersection."

936
00:57:58.502 --> 00:58:00.502
"140km per hour"?

937
00:58:01.573 --> 00:58:03.232
Gangjeong Intersection is...

938
00:58:03.232 --> 00:58:05.872
in the opposite direction from the shopping mall.

939
00:58:05.872 --> 00:58:07.812
He said he went to the shopping mall,

940
00:58:07.812 --> 00:58:09.912
but he got a speeding ticket at a totally random place.

941
00:58:09.912 --> 00:58:11.943
I was like, "What is this about?"

942
00:58:12.383 --> 00:58:15.283
The ticket was issued at 4:20pm,

943
00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:16.752
so at 4:27pm,

944
00:58:16.752 --> 00:58:19.423
Moo Gang must've been driving at 140km per hour...

945
00:58:19.423 --> 00:58:20.823
while going somewhere.

946
00:58:21.522 --> 00:58:26.263
He went for evidence and appeared 2 hours later at 9pm.

947
00:58:27.662 --> 00:58:29.033
That's enough time...

948
00:58:29.363 --> 00:58:32.763
to find and place the piece of evidence somewhere.

949
00:58:44.542 --> 00:58:45.542
I found it.

950
00:58:48.452 --> 00:58:51.182
"LMB Investment"?

951
00:58:52.752 --> 00:58:55.352
Hold on. Where did I see that company's name?

952
00:58:57.562 --> 00:59:01.763
Royeol Construction gave 65 million dollars to the company 10 years ago.

953
00:59:02.033 --> 00:59:03.803
They bought the land of Moojin Time Mart.

954
00:59:04.832 --> 00:59:07.573
In 1997, Oh Man Ho invested...

955
00:59:07.772 --> 00:59:09.573
30 million dollars in this company.

956
00:59:10.272 --> 00:59:13.542
With that money, the company bought the land.

957
00:59:13.872 --> 00:59:16.682
10 years later, Oh Man Ho bought the same land...

958
00:59:17.542 --> 00:59:20.013
by giving 65 million dollars.

959
00:59:21.852 --> 00:59:24.022
That means he put 35 million dollars in his own pocket.

960
00:59:29.452 --> 00:59:30.562
That's right.

961
00:59:35.133 --> 00:59:36.193
What's this?

962
00:59:37.502 --> 00:59:39.633
It's a paper company.

963
00:59:40.832 --> 00:59:44.102
I knew it. The books were too clean.

964
00:59:48.513 --> 00:59:52.142
They were using the difference for lobby funds through the company.

965
01:00:20.013 --> 01:00:21.812
What's the piece of evidence?

966
01:00:24.243 --> 01:00:27.582
If he found it, he must have kept it somewhere safe.

967
01:00:47.573 --> 01:00:48.872
What's this?

968
01:01:09.193 --> 01:01:12.162
(Royeol Oh Man Ho)

969
01:01:12.263 --> 01:01:14.232
"Royeol Oh Man Ho"?

970
01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:16.803
Why did Moo Gang do this?

971
01:01:20.202 --> 01:01:24.343
"1997", "Moojin, "Woo Byung Sik".

972
01:01:25.872 --> 01:01:29.642
Did Woo Byung Sik work at Moojin Chunsu Insurance in 1997?

973
01:01:31.213 --> 01:01:32.582
Did Oh Man Ho...

974
01:01:40.622 --> 01:01:43.763
"A Fire at Moojin in 1997".

975
01:01:45.022 --> 01:01:47.062
Wait, where did I see this?

976
01:01:47.332 --> 01:01:48.593
What's this?

977
01:01:48.732 --> 01:01:51.562
"A Fire at Moojin in 1997".

978
01:01:51.662 --> 01:01:54.372
He struggles with a case from two days ago.

979
01:01:54.372 --> 01:01:56.473
Why is he looking at a case from 20 years ago?

980
01:01:57.403 --> 01:01:58.673
That's right.

981
01:02:01.073 --> 01:02:02.243
Han Moo Gang...

982
01:02:03.312 --> 01:02:05.482
had the investigation file for this case.

983
01:02:07.283 --> 01:02:08.412
No way.

984
01:02:16.352 --> 01:02:18.062
The smell will get stuck in the car.

985
01:02:18.093 --> 01:02:19.292
I'm sorry.

986
01:02:19.963 --> 01:02:22.792
I was delivering fish when the detective called me.

987
01:02:22.932 --> 01:02:24.033
I came in such a hurry.

988
01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:30.542
Why did Crazy Dog ask me to drop her off? It's a nuisance.

989
01:02:32.772 --> 01:02:34.343
What happened to you...

990
01:02:35.713 --> 01:02:37.613
wasn't an accident.

991
01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:41.053
He will...

992
01:02:42.113 --> 01:02:44.752
try to kill you again.

993
01:02:45.252 --> 01:02:46.423
So...

994
01:02:47.452 --> 01:02:50.863
That means Han Moo Gang was killed while investigating Joon's case.

995
01:02:50.963 --> 01:02:54.193
Then did the same person kill Joon and Han Moo Gang?

996
01:02:56.832 --> 01:02:58.062
That's none of my business.

997
01:03:03.002 --> 01:03:04.372
Thank you, Detective Han.

998
01:03:09.473 --> 01:03:10.783
Goodbye then.

999
01:03:14.713 --> 01:03:17.653
Ma'am, why are you so late?

1000
01:03:17.823 --> 01:03:19.823
- What are you doing? - Darn it.

1001
01:03:19.852 --> 01:03:21.292
- You jerks. - Hey!

1002
01:03:22.193 --> 01:03:23.662
- Seriously. - Get off me.

1003
01:03:24.423 --> 01:03:27.593
- Darn it. - Hey, break everything!

1004
01:03:44.443 --> 01:03:45.642
What?

1005
01:03:46.082 --> 01:03:48.783
Where did he go after telling me to drop off that smelly woman?

1006
01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.082
Didn't you see him?

1007
01:03:50.082 --> 01:03:53.223
He ran out after reading a document that he found in your drawer.

1008
01:03:53.323 --> 01:03:54.452
A document?

1009
01:04:04.263 --> 01:04:07.002
Didn't Ha Ram's father investigate this case?

1010
01:04:08.633 --> 01:04:10.872
Was it in Han Moo Gang's drawer?

1011
01:04:13.272 --> 01:04:14.713
In the lady's belly,

1012
01:04:15.213 --> 01:04:17.142
a piece of yellow paper is burning.

1013
01:04:17.513 --> 01:04:19.113
A piece of yellow paper is burning?

1014
01:04:39.602 --> 01:04:42.633
What we found at the fire incident at Moojin...

1015
01:04:43.943 --> 01:04:46.502
was also found at the crime scene of Lee Mi So?

1016
01:04:59.993 --> 01:05:01.892
- Get off me! - You brats!

1017
01:05:01.892 --> 01:05:03.423
Come here!

1018
01:05:06.392 --> 01:05:09.863
You punks, stop right there!

1019
01:05:20.013 --> 01:05:21.912
(Identity search)

1020
01:05:30.723 --> 01:05:32.252
Are these Chinese bills?

1021
01:05:32.323 --> 01:05:35.522
The test result shows that it's a bill.

1022
01:05:35.622 --> 01:05:38.522
It's yellow, so I'm sure it's Chinese bills.

1023
01:05:38.622 --> 01:05:40.693
Why would he burn money after murdering?

1024
01:05:40.693 --> 01:05:42.093
In China,

1025
01:05:42.093 --> 01:05:43.932
people burn money when someone dies.

1026
01:05:43.932 --> 01:05:45.633
It's a custom to free the spirit.

1027
01:05:45.662 --> 01:05:48.832
Maybe it was an act of exorcism after the murder.

1028
01:05:53.372 --> 01:05:55.173
Did he come from China?

1029
01:05:56.073 --> 01:05:58.243
I think it's him indeed.

1030
01:06:03.982 --> 01:06:07.423
It's a video of the night before Sang Min's warrant was overturned.

1031
01:06:07.553 --> 01:06:11.323
Let it be a prosecutor. It can be Nam Joong Pyo.

1032
01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.332
Just dare to get into that car.

1033
01:06:16.032 --> 01:06:17.063
What?

1034
01:06:18.303 --> 01:06:19.563
What's this?

1035
01:06:19.862 --> 01:06:22.032
Why is Mi So with him?

1036
01:06:43.463 --> 01:06:44.822
What's the matter?

1037
01:06:50.862 --> 01:06:52.463
Look. It's him, isn't it?

1038
01:06:52.862 --> 01:06:55.402
Isn't this man who killed the doctor and ran away?

1039
01:06:57.473 --> 01:06:58.502
Give it to me.

1040
01:07:02.473 --> 01:07:03.483
Look.

1041
01:07:04.213 --> 01:07:06.042
Yes, it's him.

1042
01:07:06.042 --> 01:07:07.183
Really?

1043
01:07:07.683 --> 01:07:10.883
Did this insane murderer kill Ha Ram's father?

1044
01:07:10.952 --> 01:07:12.452
And he's still alive?

1045
01:07:13.492 --> 01:07:14.893
Who's still alive?

1046
01:07:16.593 --> 01:07:19.893
The man who killed your father. Take a look.

1047
01:07:25.733 --> 01:07:27.002
I definitely heard...

1048
01:07:28.072 --> 01:07:30.042
that he was dead.

1049
01:07:30.572 --> 01:07:32.542
Why is there a scar on his face?

1050
01:07:32.942 --> 01:07:34.372
Where did you get this photo?

1051
01:07:34.912 --> 01:07:36.173
It was taken by Oh Man Ho's black box.

1052
01:07:36.513 --> 01:07:39.683
It was taken from behind his car when he was with Mi So.

1053
01:07:43.053 --> 01:07:44.282
Lee Mi So?

1054
01:07:47.292 --> 01:07:49.353
Is the murderer of Lee Mi So...

1055
01:07:51.162 --> 01:07:52.723
who killed my father?

1056
01:07:53.992 --> 01:07:57.402
Did I let the man who killed my father get away twice?

1057
01:08:02.173 --> 01:08:03.402
Ha Ram... Ha Ram.

1058
01:08:03.942 --> 01:08:06.603
No way. I heard that he was dead.

1059
01:08:06.872 --> 01:08:08.872
He's definitely dead. It can't be.

1060
01:08:09.473 --> 01:08:11.643
His sister-in-law said that he was dead.

1061
01:08:12.143 --> 01:08:13.612
Is your brother-in-law dead?

1062
01:08:13.883 --> 01:08:17.782
This isn't your brother-in-law, right?

1063
01:08:18.622 --> 01:08:20.292
Please leave.

1064
01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:24.893
Answer me. Tell me that your brother-in-law is dead.

1065
01:08:24.893 --> 01:08:26.593
Tell me that it isn't him.

1066
01:08:27.233 --> 01:08:30.103
Tell me that the serial killer is someone else.

1067
01:08:30.502 --> 01:08:32.103
Answer me!

1068
01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:42.713
I don't know anything about him.

1069
01:08:42.713 --> 01:08:44.742
So don't ever come back.

1070
01:08:45.883 --> 01:08:47.752
Your brother-in-law will kill you.

1071
01:08:47.752 --> 01:08:49.013
Run away now.

1072
01:08:49.383 --> 01:08:50.883
You're insane.

1073
01:08:51.282 --> 01:08:52.353
Wait.

1074
01:09:06.002 --> 01:09:07.872
Ha Ram already found out.

1075
01:09:09.402 --> 01:09:10.473
Wait.

1076
01:09:11.502 --> 01:09:13.473
Did she go to his sister-in-law's house already?

1077
01:09:48.372 --> 01:09:50.612
I guess she hasn't come yet.

1078
01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:03.362
Excuse me.

1079
01:10:04.622 --> 01:10:06.792
Is this the man who killed the director?

1080
01:10:06.792 --> 01:10:09.093
I think so,

1081
01:10:09.093 --> 01:10:12.162
but another detective already came to ask.

1082
01:10:12.162 --> 01:10:14.002
What? Who?

1083
01:10:15.572 --> 01:10:18.242
- When are the forensics coming? - They're coming right now.

1084
01:10:18.242 --> 01:10:19.402
In that case...

1085
01:10:19.402 --> 01:10:21.713
Don't step on it. Move away from it.

1086
01:10:21.713 --> 01:10:23.683
- How dare you? - Leave it alone.

1087
01:10:23.683 --> 01:10:24.843
Goodness.

1088
01:10:24.912 --> 01:10:27.713
Let's talk. Come here.

1089
01:10:28.213 --> 01:10:30.622
What happened? Do you remember anything?

1090
01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.023
No.

1091
01:10:33.492 --> 01:10:35.353
Then how did you know...

1092
01:10:35.353 --> 01:10:37.893
that the man from the fire incident at Moojin was the murderer?

1093
01:10:37.893 --> 01:10:39.893
Gwang Gyun! Gwang Gyun.

1094
01:10:39.963 --> 01:10:41.532
- What is it? - Look.

1095
01:10:41.532 --> 01:10:43.902
What is it? Stop trembling.

1096
01:10:43.902 --> 01:10:45.103
You hold it.

1097
01:10:45.103 --> 01:10:48.673
Something was caught on camera. I think it's the culprit.

1098
01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:51.402
Look, someone is following him.

1099
01:10:52.673 --> 01:10:55.273
What? Did she come here already?

1100
01:11:00.152 --> 01:11:01.282
Ha Ram.

1101
01:11:02.252 --> 01:11:03.523
Ha Ram!

1102
01:11:09.593 --> 01:11:10.923
Ha Ram.

1103
01:11:12.223 --> 01:11:13.532
Ha Ram!

1104
01:11:29.242 --> 01:11:30.313
Ha Ram.

1105
01:11:31.883 --> 01:11:33.013
Ha Ram!

1106
01:12:16.723 --> 01:12:17.862
No.

1107
01:12:18.492 --> 01:12:19.763
She isn't dead.

1108
01:12:20.332 --> 01:12:22.992
She can't die unless we open the capsule.

1109
01:12:29.872 --> 01:12:31.242
Why is this here?

1110
01:12:31.242 --> 01:12:33.143
Who leaves this around so carelessly?

1111
01:12:33.912 --> 01:12:35.713
Gosh, it belongs to 444.

1112
01:12:36.513 --> 01:12:38.442
I thought that he ran away.

1113
01:12:38.442 --> 01:12:41.053
This will serve him right.

1114
01:12:47.523 --> 01:12:48.952
Ha Ram!

1115
01:12:50.723 --> 01:12:51.963
Ha Ram.

1116
01:12:54.593 --> 01:12:56.032
Ha Ram!

1117
01:13:10.983 --> 01:13:12.183
Ha Ram.

1118
01:13:18.423 --> 01:13:20.723
- Hello? - I have the blood test results.

1119
01:13:21.322 --> 01:13:23.492
It's 99.98 percent certain that it's Ha Ram's blood.

1120
01:13:23.492 --> 01:13:24.593
What?

1121
01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:30.233
If she lost two liters of blood,

1122
01:13:30.233 --> 01:13:31.902
it's impossible for her to survive.

1123
01:13:35.803 --> 01:13:37.242
She... She died?

1124
01:14:34.063 --> 01:14:35.692
(Black)
